This feature sounds interesting . Would people prefer a hygienic syntactic macro system?

Something similar to http://www.sweetjs.org

What I want out of this feature is C-PreProcessor-style macros, and also compiler support to output a flattened file. The `import` logic would also live inside of this preprocessor.

@wjmelements input files should not be flattened and not all ways to compile a contract system can be done on a flattened file. preprocessor style macros are also very hard to check, I would not support implementing them as part of the compiler.

Can we close this issue since it provides no syntactical suggestion and it is pretty much useless?

Macro is a very important feature missing in Solidity, it would be incredibly useful for developers when debugging complex code during development.
One way to currently achieve that is to emit a lot of events along a function to map what's going on. [example](https://github.com/flockonus/eth-denver-2019/blob/master/contract/contracts/City.sol#L225-L285), it's clearly undesirable.

It would be great to have flags that can be active only during development deployments, and not during production for logging events, for instance. Or balancing game mechanics.

In my mind it would also be similar to [c macros](https://www.quora.com/What-are-macros-in-C) in addition of taking an env var to define the mode / network it's being deployed to

@flockonus have you tried just using the C preprocessor?

@chriseth i didn't really think of searching outside the language until you ask now.

It seems [solpp is a preprocessor for solidity](https://github.com/merklejerk/solpp), and looks good, perhaps just missing env var support on compilation (seems easy to add).

The implementation seems to fit a macro system very well, has many features, but it won't work with linters or syntax highlighters since it's not part of the language.

Before considering implementing macro support I would first define what problems it should solve exactly.
I personally don't like the idea of macros at all as they are (often) just another language on top of the language and not type aware at all. And the reason they (usually) exist is the lack of compile-time features of the main language. 
If we have such a list of what one wants macros for, we might can translate that into features that could go directly into the Solidity language.

Good point. Personally I constantly run in 2 use cases:

One use case is logging by using events during development, and even changing function modifiers.

Sometimes also makes sense to change time spans, for instance, in production a class could require a freeze period of 1y, but during tests, 10 seconds is enough.

Current workarounds are:
The first is achieved by manually un/commenting a lot of lines.
For the second I create a class to inherit and override params and use that one for tests.

For the first: I don't actually know enough about events and logging to have a useful suggestion here. I leave this one to others for now :>

For the second, a language feature could be something like a way to define global variables that has a default but can be overridden by cmd line parameters (or json input) when compiling.

This specific sub problem is solved by Truffle for example providing a way to advance time in tests. I think that is a better approach because you are actually testing the production code and not a "for testing only" version.

Regarding events and testing I think `test` attributes found in Rust could provide a good example:

```
#[test]
emit DebugOnlyEvent();
```

When compiling for release output this code will not be included. However this feature has to be very restricted otherwise has the potential that testing and release binaries differ way to much negating the usefulness of tests.

I do not support this feature request. Pre-processing can be done outside of Solidity. The C preprocessor is one candidate.

When I read the code for a deployed contract I want to see what was deployed, not a bunch of other stuff that was not deployed.

Look at the blockchain directly then, not the contract source. Code is high level.
