Recently did a fresh pull and tried to re-build my copy of `solc`. Got this error:

```
c++: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-fstack-protector-strong’
```

So I updated to gcc-4.9, per a suggestion on [StackOverflow](http://askubuntu.com/questions/466651/how-do-i-use-the-latest-gcc-4-9-on-ubuntu-14-04) and now I get:

```

Sorry, gcc 4.9 is not a hard requirement. When [this](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum-cmake/pull/45) gets merged you will be able to build even with older gcc.

As for your error in solidity let me try it out now and see.

I can't reproduce your compile error with gcc 5.2. Can you try and make sure that you have pulled the latest cpp-ethereum-cmake and made a clean build of cpp-ethereum?
