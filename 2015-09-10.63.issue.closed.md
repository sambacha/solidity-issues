# [\#63 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/63) `closed`: Creating a contract from within itself is not caught properly
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2015-09-10 08:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/63):

Creating a contract from within itself is not possible since it would have to include its own code:

```
contract C { function f() { var x = new C(); } }
```

(there might be workarounds to make this possible, but we do not allow it for now)

The error, though, is not caught at the analysis phase, but only at code generation phase and results in an internal compiler error.
