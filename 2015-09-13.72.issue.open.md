It should be possible to declare different modifiers with the same name but different argument types, as it is possible for functions.

For example:
```
contract C {
  modifier m(uint a) { _; }
  modifier m(bytes b) { _; }
  modifier m(uint a, bytes b) { _; }
}
```

I see this've been open for 2 years but no activity. Anything on this regard?

I agree this is a desirable feature... Any other opinions on the matter?

Also maybe should it be possible for a modifier to have the same name as a function?

I think that is an idea which goes against the aim of code clarity.

Can a variable have the same name as a function? Can a class have the same name as a variable? Can a modifier have the same name as a struct? Is shadowing possible? Are any number of confusing things allowed?

There is active work against allowing shadowing, see the latest warnings about shadowing.

Does #3041 imply that we do want this and it's pending implementation?

because so far there was no clear response to this issue

+1 modifier overload would be super useful, e.g.:

```solidity
    modifier notPreviousBool(bool previous, bool current) {
        require(
            current != previous,
            "notPreviousBool: 'current' state must differ from the 'previous' one"
        );
        _;
    }
    modifier notPreviousUint256(uint256 previous, uint256 current) {
        require(
            current != previous,
            "notPreviousUint256: 'current' value must differ from the 'previous' one"
        );
        _;
    }
```
