Which cmake version do you have?
Can you post a bigger log?

There's no bigger log.

```
Simon-2:solidity simon$ mkdir build
Simon-2:solidity simon$ cd build/
Simon-2:build simon$ cmake ..

```

cmake 3.3.1.

To clarify, I want to build only Solidity (per those instructions at the top).

Hmm only solidity while you have cloned the umbrella project?

The solidity directory you are in, is in the umbrella project or is it a standalone project? Have you built the dependencies?

I added an alternate way to build the repos in the wiki. It does not utilize the umbrella project but clones/updates only the repos required for a project in the current directory and then builds them. You can also give that a try if you want to build only solidity:

The helpers worked perfectly! Thank you!

@LefterisJP What happened to the helper instructions?

What do you mean @simondlr ? If it's the link then I think it's just the wiki link changed. It should be here: https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki/Linux--Generic-Building

Ah, thank you @LefterisJP! I didn't think to look under the Linux pages!

I am facing the same issue as @simondlr while building `solidity-v0.3.5`. Any help would be appreciated.
