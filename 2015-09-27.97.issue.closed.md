The following code does not work as expected.

```
contract testing
{
    function test() public
    {
        address[] players;
        players.length++;
        players[0] = 0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733cr;
    }
}
```

Response for the browser compiler: Parser error: Expected primary expression.
players[0] = 0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733cr;

Just for clarification, the compiler is complaining about setting the address to the variable.

Whoa. I guess I was tired last night. There's a typo in the address, presumably from old data. At the end there's an "r" which is not only invalid hex; it also makes the address too long. I'm closing this report.
