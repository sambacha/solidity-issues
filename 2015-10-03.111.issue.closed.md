# [\#111 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/111) `closed`: Build Request: minimize dependencies

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/480497?v=4" width="50">[nejucomo](https://github.com/nejucomo) opened issue at [2015-10-03 23:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/111):

I would like to be able to install `solc` with minimal dependencies. When I try this:

``` bash
$ git clone 'https://github.com/ethereum/solidity`
$ mkdir -p solidity/build
$ cd solidity/build
$ cmake ..
```

-then this fails because I need `webthree-helpers`, and that, in turn, depends on many things like `leveldb`, `opencl`, etc...

I don't see why `solc` would require leveldb, since I expect it just compiles source files to asts or bytecode. It would be nice if building only `solc` did not require excessive dependencies.

(BTW, is this the right approach to building `solc`? I had some trouble finding clear documentation, so I filed #110 separately.)
