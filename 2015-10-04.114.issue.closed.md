# [\#114 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/114) `closed`: getting multiple return values / returning structs in external functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/924397?u=4c3e5a7b67595961461f5ac3e1dd41aca26a5b4b&v=4" width="50">[nmushegian](https://github.com/nmushegian) opened issue at [2015-10-04 16:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/114):

We need it to detect VM failures when we also need to return 0. The original solution is to `function get() returns (bytes32 value, bool ok)`. The workaround is to make a type like: `struct nullable_word { bytes32 word, bool ok }`. Except now there's a separate issue preventing the use of structs in external functions which blocked that option too

High priority?

The story does have high priority, and the simplest use case which is hopefully sufficient for your needs will probably be implemented in the next days.

Is there anyway i can return a struct from an external function?
If can't, it can be really troublesome. which means i need to return each value in struct and reassemble in the caller function.

I think currently you still have to return every element of a structure as a separate variable and reassemble again
