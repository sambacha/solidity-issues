# [\#129 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/129) `closed`: Internal Compiler Error on library compilation when returning struct with constant function

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/824194?v=4" width="50">[pipermerriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam) opened issue at [2015-10-12 21:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/129):

This seems to cause an Internal Compiler error

```
library Something {
    struct Thing {}

    function doit() constant returns (Thing) {
        ...
    }
}
```

traceback

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/tmp/cpp-ethereum20151009-37257-4or8xw/solidity/libsolidity/Types.cpp(1532): Throw in function string dev::solidity::FunctionType::externalSignature() const
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<dev::solidity::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: std::exception
[dev::tag_comment*] = External function type requested.
```

Seems to have to do with trying to return a struct from a `constant` function.

Thank you for reporting. I don't think this has to do with `constant`, I guess it is just the same as #127.
