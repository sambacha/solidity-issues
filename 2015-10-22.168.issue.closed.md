# [\#168 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/168) `closed`: Compilation produces different bytecode depending on how it is called.

If you take this directory of libraries https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-alarm-clock/tree/d66ee63943e4145f9baf29e5d479963fc4b08c84/libraries

and compile the `GroveLib` library using the following two ways.
- `solc --optimize --bin --bin-runtime libraries/*`
- `solc --bin --bin-runtime --optimize libraries/GroveLib.sol`

you will get different bytecode outputs.

This is done using the following version of solc.

``` bash
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.1.5-e11e10f8/Release-Darwin/clang/JIT linked to libethereum-1.1.0-8e11a861/Release-Darwin/clang/JIT
```

The `--optimize` flag doesn't seem to matter.  It's different output with or without it.

Also, it isn't just the runtime that is different.  the binary is also different.

Sorry, I cannot reproduce this on Linux. Could you put the actual results you get on some github gist?
If the assembly is different, this would be really helpful.

Closing as not reproducible. Please reopen if the problem can be reproduced.
