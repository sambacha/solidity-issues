**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

At some point in the documentation there should be a list of all keywords (reserved words) of the language.

@Denton-L I think you have done is too?

I've done bits and pieces but never _all_ of the keywords. I can add this onto my priority queue of things to do, though.

I can do this but I'm not sure where to put this without duplicating a bunch of stuff that's already been written...

Perhaps we should upgrade grammar.txt to be part of the documentation, then we could also give a list of keywords in the same section.

As a start the _reserved keyword_ list might be useful to be included. Alternatively we should emit proper errors from Solidity for reserved keywords.

"`grammar.txt` in documentation" has its own issue now #1176.
