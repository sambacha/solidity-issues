# [\#413 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/413) `closed`: Move libevmasm to solidity

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-03-03 16:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/413):

libevmasm, liblll and lllc should be moved into the solidity repository (as directories parallel to libsolidity). Please keep the commit history, for example by doing it like that: http://gbayer.com/development/moving-files-from-one-git-repository-to-another-preserving-history/

And lllc too presumably?

Hmm.   Won't that make libethereum dependent on solidity?

What about libevmcore?

Have a look at http://doublethinkco.github.io/webthree-umbrella-cross/images/target_dependency_graph.svg.

I think what you are saying here makes sense, but we'll just have a little bit to work through on these edge cases.

BTW - I cannot add labels here.   Are permissions for Solidity repo using different teams/groups?   Ditto Mix.

We might duplicate libevmcore

Right.

As we discussed a while back, as all the various clients already have copies of this stuff, duplicating it between eth and solidity is a bit smelly, but not the worst thing in the world for the decoupling that would give us.

Will the cpp vm also be part of the build, or is it compiler only? Just curious.

@androlo not totally sure what you mean, but the compiler does not need the vm.

Just curious if it would be compiler only or if it would also have the VM, maybe for some extra coding tools later or w/e.

Hey @androlo,

There is some detail on what we are looking to do at http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/index.html#project-reboot, though the aim is actually to go a little further than that, even, and to sever the link from solidity into "cpp-ethereum" in that target diagram entirely, so that the Solidity smart contract compiler and the eth C++ runtime are completely separate.

We will still have a dependency onto cpp-ethereum for soltest for the time being.    Further refactorings and decoupling is required before that link can be severed.

Aleth\* and mix will depend on both eth and solidity still, though Aleth\* apps are on their way out, and we hope to make it possible for mix to sit on top of multiple runtime clients (so geth or eth, and maybe more).

Thank you.
