It seems that this change is not too compatible with our type system. The main reason is that statically-sized arrays are encoded without length prefix in the ABI encoding and quite some places in the code base assume that this encoding is the same for memory.

Failure for colocolo. Moving back to backlog.

From Pivotaltracker:
> The only difference between static and dynamic arrays in memory is that their size is known at compile-time or not.
> On the other hand, static arrays do not have an explicit length prefix, which makes it impossible to assign static arrays to variables of dynamic array type.
> To make this possible, we should reserve space for the length prefix and potentially write it to memory at the point of assignment (conversion).
> We might consider allowing conversion of empty arrays to anything (so that we can use `[]` as initializer).

With the new ABI coder, we might re-try this one.

One of the main goals here is also to be able to convert array literals to both dynamic and static array types.

This would be super helpful. I am running into issues with my contracts hitting their size limits because I have a lot of strings. I am working to compress duplicate string data but I need to be able to pass a fixed-length string into a function expecting a dynamic array to work this out. All the ways I have seen of doing this so far seem to end up creating so much extra code I am sure it will make me hit the limit, thus making my efforts in vain.
Anyone know any updates on this or current workarounds that are more succinct?
