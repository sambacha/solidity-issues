Unable to reproduce in `solc`. Does that happen only for browser-solidity or also for the npm version? My guess would be that when fetching the source, the string `"\x12\x80"` is actually parsed, converted to a binary string (without hex escapes) and then interpreted as utf-8 which fails.

Actually that might be the reason. I've been using it in the Javascript bindings for solc and it is very likely Javascript does that to escape codes.

Probably related to https://github.com/chriseth/browser-solidity/issues/114

@axic did you use browser-solidity in the browser or plain npm?

Via npm, it is likely that Javascript itself does it.

I cannot test it in browser-solidity because of https://github.com/chriseth/browser-solidity/issues/132

This is apparently a bug in Solidity and/or Emscripten as explained in https://github.com/chriseth/browser-solidity/issues/132.

I think this can be closed here. @chriseth?

#603 explains this issue properly. Closing this in favour of it.

This `string memory x = "\x12\x80";` -> `PUSH32 0x12C2800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` was caused by Javascript's JSON converter. Perhaps that is a separate bug.
