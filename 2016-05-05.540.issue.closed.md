# [\#540 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/540) `closed`: Style Guide on Single-Line Functions?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9620836?u=6a792ee80e79b87f64f6aa16bd323e5a7a7bad97&v=4" width="50">[Denton-L](https://github.com/Denton-L) opened issue at [2016-05-05 18:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/540):

Is there any agreement on whether or not declaring short functions (one statement) on a single line is fine? If there is an agreement, I can add it into the style guide.
