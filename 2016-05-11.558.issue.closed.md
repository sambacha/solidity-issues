I've been resetting my branch to the latest in origin and for whatever reason it is refusing to work on any contracts I deploy. The end to end tests in the soltest are not working. Big big big problem. Running on OS X El Capitan.

Ouch.   Do you have access to a Windows or Linux box to see if there is a chronic multi-platform failure?
Or a different OS X box?

Running off my own machine. I could try to docker it up again.

weird...I put it in the sanitize mode...no seg faults...just horrendously slow.

...now I've put it back...it works perfectly fine. So strange. Alright. Closing for now.
