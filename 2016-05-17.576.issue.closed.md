# [\#576 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/576) `closed`: Short-Circuit Booleans Not Implemented

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9620836?u=6a792ee80e79b87f64f6aa16bd323e5a7a7bad97&v=4" width="50">[Denton-L](https://github.com/Denton-L) opened issue at [2016-05-17 18:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/576):

Expected result, test() should return 0.
Actual result, test() returns 5.

Test code:

```
contract Test {
    uint asdf = 0;

    function setToFive() returns (bool) {
        asdf = 5;
        return true;
    }

    function test() constant returns (uint) {
        if (true || setToFive()) {}

        return asdf;
    }
}
```

This result was expected because Solidity was designed with JavaScript in mind and JavaScript implements short-circuit evaluation by default using the `||` and `&&`  operators.

Do you get this result when running inside browser-solidity? I'm asking because I cannot reproduce your reported behaviour.

Yeah, I'm running under browser-solidity. I suppose this is an issue for _that_ repository?

It works now?????

I may have looked at the wrong value while testing by mistake.
