# [\#583 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/583) `closed`: warn about usage of `this` in constructor
**Labels**: `enhancement`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/470008?v=4" width="50">[dwhjames](https://github.com/dwhjames) opened issue at [2016-05-19 03:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/583):

This was originally a bug report that turned into a feature request:

The compiler should warn about calling functions on `this` in the constructor and any function called from the constructor. I think we will not be able to catch all cases (you also have to include modifiers, base classes and other things), but we could at least try.

---

This seems like a compiler bug to me, unless I have a misunderstanding here…

Consider the contract

``` js
contract PingPong {
    function PingPong() {
        this.foo(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    function () {
        this.foo(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    function foo(address originalSender, uint originalValue) {
        originalSender.send(originalValue);
    }
}
```

You can see this deployed on Morden here: [0x1689e1992bc3690383d74d439e4055c34a2640fe](http://testnet.etherscan.io/address/0x1689e1992bc3690383d74d439e4055c34a2640fe)

Upon contract creation, I was expecting the value sent with the tx to be bounced back to the sender. Instead, the contract ends up sending the ETH to itself in an internal tx: `msg.sender` was resolved to the address of the newly created contract _not_ the true sender.

(The default method works as expected: two internal txs, the second returning the ETH to the original sender.)

Lifting `msg.sender` to a local name makes no difference:

``` js
contract PingPong {
    function PingPong() {
        address originalSender = msg.sender;
        uint originalValue = msg.value;
        this.foo(originalSender, originalValue);
    }
…
```

Only an internal method call works as expected:

``` js
contract PingPong {
    function PingPong() {
        foo(msg.value, msg.sender);
    }
…
```

Is this a bug? Have I misunderstood something special about the constructor?

Just tried the following snippet in browser-solidity and it shows different addresses for the contract and the variables `x`:

```
contract c {
    address public x;
    function c() { x = msg.sender; }
}
```

Perhaps you are confusing the contract address with the contract creator address?

Hi @chriseth,
Thanks for the reply, but I think you’ve misunderstood my bug report.

In your example `c`, yes I fully expect the value of address `x` to be the contract creator address.

Instead, try:

``` js
contract c {
    address public x;
    function c() { this.setX(msg.sender); }
    function setX(address _x) { x = _x; }
}
```

@dwhjames I think there might different issues going on here.

For this I get the proper sender stored in `x`:

```
contract c {
    address public x;
    function c() { x = msg.sender; }
    function setX(address _x) { x = _x; }
}
```

For your last example I get `0` stored in `x`.

Update: by removing the `this` keyword in the constructor from your example the proper value is stored. `x = this;` works properly, so perhaps it is a bug in the compiler?

Indeed, which is exactly the nature of the bug that I’m trying to point out.

Case 1:

```
contract c {
    address public x;
    function c() {
        address tmp = msg.sender;
        this.setX(tmp);
    }
    function setX(address _x) { x = _x; }
}
```

Case 2:

```
contract c {
    address public x;
    function c() {
        address tmp = msg.sender;
        setX(tmp);
    }
    function setX(address _x) { x = _x; }
}
```

My impression: Case 1 and Case 2 should be observably equivalent (with respect to the final value of `x`); however, Case 1 is ‘broken’.

It seems _exceedingly_ suspicious to me that the evaluation of `msg.sender`, stored in the variable `tmp`, depends on whether the next statement is `this.setX(tmp)` or `setX(tmp)`!

@dwhjames there is a big difference between `this.setX` and `setX`. The first is a message-call, i.e. it creates a new call context inside ethereum ("internal transaction") and thus has an effect on `msg`. The second is a contract-internal call which does not create such an internal transaction.

@chriseth, I am aware that there is a big difference `this.setX` and `setX`.

You appear to be claiming that the evaluation of:

```
line 1: address tmp = msg.sender;
```

_should_ be different, depending on if this next line is

```
line 2: this.setX(tmp);
```

or

```
line 2: setX(tmp);
```

i.e. rules of lexical scope are broken? And the semantics of the statement on line 1 are affected by the semantics of the statement on a subsequent line?

Can we agree that, _no matter what_, the evaluation of `msg.sender`, in the scope of a contract constructor, _must_ be the address of the contract creator?

And to further drive the point home, my original example was of the following pattern:

```
contract c {
    address public x;
    function c() {
        address tmp = msg.sender;
        this.setX(tmp);
    }
    function () {
        address tmp = msg.sender;
        this.setX(tmp);
    }
    function setX(address _x) { x = _x; }
}
```

Could you explain the discrepancy between the constructor and the default function?

Ok, I'm sorry, I did not read your comment correctly. This is what happens: When the contract is still in construction, its code is not yet deployed to its address (that is a "feature" / limitation of the EVM). This means if you call `this.setX(tmp)`, you call a function on a non-existing contract and thus `setX` is not really called. When the fallback function is called, the contract does exist and thus `setX` is correctly called.

@chriseth, sorry, but I’m still not convinced by this answer…

Here’s why:

``` js
contract c {
    address public x;
    address public y;
    function c() {
        address tmp = msg.sender;
        this.setX(tmp);
        setY(tmp);
    }
    function setX(address _x) { x = _x; }
    function setY(address _y) { y = _y; }
}
```
- `x == 0`
- `y == creator`

For this to be the case, that means that `solc` has mangled

```
address tmp = msg.sender;
this.setX(tmp);
setY(tmp);
```

in such a way that `tmp` is effective evaluated _twice_, not the once, as it appears lexically.
So it becomes the 0 address in the context of the second line, and the actual creator address on the third line.

(Btw, I am compiling without the optimizer turned on.)

So it would appear that

```
address tmp = msg.sender;
```

Is actually getting inlined!? and thus the value of the variable `tmp` takes on two different values.

Ok, I’m starting to see where you’re coming from here…

```
contract c {
    uint public x;
    uint public y;
    function c() {
        uint tmp = msg.value + 1;
        this.setX(tmp);
        setY(tmp);
    }
    function setX(uint _x) { x = _x + 1; }
    function setY(uint _y) { y = _y + 1; }
}
```

Send 1 Wei:
- `x == 0`
- `y == 3`

So any call to `this.someFunction` turns into a no-op?

No, it is not about the variable `tmp`. The function call `this.setX(tmp)` just fails, it does not have any effect. Your code is identical to the one where `this.setX(tmp)` is commented out (minus gas costs of course).

yep :-)

Ok… yikes.

But it’s a no-op that does at least get registered as an internal transaction?
Back to my original example:

```
contract PingPong {
    function PingPong() {
        this.foo(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
…
```

This internal call shows up:

Yes, it is an internal transaction that does nothing.

Maybe it would be a good enhancement to warn/error if `this` is used as part of a method call from the constructor? Probably hard to do it as it wouldn't check if any other method called from constructor does the same.

A compiler warning for at least this simple case would be great. And some documentation somewhere about this issue; did I miss existing docs that cover this?

I can understand not wanting to do a global static analysis to find violations of using `this` transitively, but even a warning to cover direct usage is worth something.

De-prioritizing because it is not a breaking change.

Wait, so this serious language design flaw was reported in May 2016 and only got "fixed" &ndash;with a compiler warning, not by actually fixing the semantics&ndash; just yesterday?
