# [\#610 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/610) `closed`: Add a "safe way to send ether" i.e. address.transfer
**Labels**: `enhancement`

`address.send` does not send along any gas and does not propagate exceptions. This is good for situation where we do not know the target, but those are limited in use as was discovered in the meantime. People resort to workarounds like `recipient.call.value(x)()`. Exactly this workaround should receive a name and it should propagate exceptions.

Suggestions for the name: `transfer` (sounds safer because transfer usually asks you to watch the whole process)

LGTM.  When this is implemented, could a warning message when `address.send` is used, be displayed and to suggest that the user probably wants to use `address.transfer` ?

As we've seen in the past couple weeks, `recipient.call.value(x)()` is very dangerous. I would therefore suggest that this method, if implemented, limit gas like `send()` does, with the only difference being the error propagation. Otherwise this will be exacerbating the reentry problem.

Wouldn't the main suggested use for `transfer` be sending value to addresses or accounts? And in the case of accounts, strictly to the fallback function?

In that case it should by default include gas enough for that only and offer the `.gas(n)` modifier.

ie. `address.transfer(1 ether)` and `address.transfer.gas(120000)(1 ether)`

I think it may make sense rejecting 0 value transfers as those seem like circumventing the real purpose of transfer.

Is error bubbling the only difference between send and transfer? I am worried that people may confuse these two, since there is little semantic clue in those names to distinguish between them.

Also, if the plan is to eventually deprecate send (to avoid this confusion), what would be the recommended migration path? Contracts could easily lock themselves if they carelessly replace send with transfer, right?

Two differences:
- throw on error
- supports the `.gas()` modifier to override the supplied gas

> if the plan is to eventually deprecate send 

See #1666. Both will be available, `send` should be deprecated, maybe removed in the future.

> Contracts could easily lock themselves if they carelessly replace send with transfer, right?

If they just replace it and the target throws, then I guess they could have situation their code won't progress forward. Hence this has a new method name and we're not changing `send`.

Thanks for the clarification!

This is implemented in develop.

I am wondering about .gas() modifier: when I tried to use it, I got _member gas not found or not visible_ compilation error (with compiler 0.4.13). Even after changing the compiler versions in Remix, the same compilation error happens.
what could be the problem here?

@gergia the `.transfer` feature never supported the `.gas` modifier, if in certain cases it did that was a bug. Did you had such a case?

No, I thought it supported `.gas` modifier based on [the answer on ethereum stackexchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/19341/address-send-vs-address-transfer-best-practice-usage) and your comment in this thread from February 8th.  
(Maybe it would make sense to comment on this stackexchange thread so that people are not misleaded, I don't have enough points for commenting yet)

Sorry, this issue was only an in-progress discussion. The documentation contains the final decision. Left a comment on stackexchange.

Still it is not working.
