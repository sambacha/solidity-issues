# [\#668 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/668) `closed`: Do not ignore gas spent in sub-calls for gas-estimation.

Currently, gas spent in sub-calls is ignored during gas-estimation. The main reason for this is that at the level where the gas estimation is performed (symbolic execution of isolated bytecode with unknown state of the blockchain), the contract that is called is unknown and thus we have to make the worst-case assumption that all gas is spent as part of the call.

This has been implemeted some time ago.
