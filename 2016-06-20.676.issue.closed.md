Look, everyone has been talking about this, and everybody has different ideas for solutions so that Solidity can grow as a language. However, in the meantime, it is imperative that developers know the best practices, what caused this bug to happen, and what absolutely NOT to do. If someone would like to take this documentation challenge on, I'd be more than happy to review your work.

I feel like re-writing or re-working the Solidity documentation should be one of the top priorities for the Ethereum community. I'm tempted to take this on.

OK, now I've done it. I've applied for a DevGrant to create "A Tour of Solidity" inspired by https://tour.golang.org. God help us.
