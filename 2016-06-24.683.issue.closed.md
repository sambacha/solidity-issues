# [\#683 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/683) `closed`: Remove tx.origin

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2374327?v=4" width="50">[PeterBorah](https://github.com/PeterBorah) opened issue at [2016-06-24 18:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/683):

## Summary

`tx.origin` is a security vulnerability, breaks compatibility with other contracts including security contracts, and is almost never useful. Removing it would make Solidity more user-friendly. If there are exceptional cases where access to the transaction origin is needed, a library using in-line assembly can provide it.
## The Problems

1) `tx.origin` is a security vulnerability. As we [recently saw with the Mist wallet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/security-alert-smart-contract-wallets-created-in-frontier-are-vulnerable-to-phishing-attacks/), using `tx.origin` makes you vulnerable to attacks comparable to phishing or cross-site scripting. Once a user has interacted with a malicious contract, that contract can then impersonate the user to any contract relying on `tx.origin`.

2) `tx.origin` breaks compatibility. Using `tx.origin` means that your contract cannot be used by another contract, because a contract can never be the `tx.origin`. This breaks the general composability of Ethereum contracts, and makes them less useful. In addition, this is another security vulnerability, because it makes security-based contracts like multisig wallets incompatible with your contract.

3) `tx.origin` is almost never useful. This is the most subjective point, but I have yet to come across a use of `tx.origin` that seemed legitimate to me. I welcome counter-examples, but I've written dozens or hundreds of smart contracts without needing it, and I have never heard of anyone else needing it either.
## Rationale for Removal

Solidity's design philosophy is to prioritize security and reliability over expressiveness. In other cases where behavior is unreliable, Solidity does not expose it. (For instance, there is no way to call an external contract and retrieve the return value if the signature is not known ahead of time.)

The "escape clause" is in-line assembly, which allows the creation of libraries to do anything expressible as EVM assembly. Behavior that is unsafe and unreliable is best kept in libraries, rather than given to all users as part of the core language.

Because it will break backwards-compatibility. If you are saying that a warning is not enough and will not be noticed, we should revisit how people compile their contracts.

Fair enough. Is Solidity committed to backwards-compatibility in general?

I would recommend at least adding it to the list of things to change when you do the next breaking change. Any code that would be broken by this needs to be broken, because it is almost certainly insecure in some way.

@slothbag Regardless of the outcome of this pull request, double and triple check that you're actually secure there. Chances are, there are ways for malicious contracts to do unexpected things by impersonating your users or your contracts. Is it ok if an attacker is able to call any of your functions at any time, with any arguments, while appearing to be a legitimate user? If not, `tx.origin` isn't safe.

Also consider whether it's ok that your users can't use multisig wallets, and can't be DAOs or anything like that.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to take a look at your contracts and offer advice for structuring your contracts so you don't need `tx.origin`. I am on a quest to eliminate it from existence!

@Nashatyrev: Why do you want to do this? It vastly reduces your user's security options, because they can't use multisig, key revocation, or other contract-based security systems. As a user, I would not appreciate being forced to use a dangerous method (a bare private/public keypair) for interacting with a contract.

Additionally, this won't work the way you expect it to after [EIP 101](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/28).

E.g. you have a Token contract (address -> balance), and you want to get fees from transferring tokens between owners. If you allow a contract to own a token account then those token can be locked and transferred between owners without any fees (i.e. kind of derivative token contract). Non-contract only accounts prevent this. As a user you may grant any contract with access to your account (which still prevents token locking) for the benefits you've mentioned. 

Not sure why EIP 101 should break this? The transaction will still have a signer and the contract invocation will still have a caller.

> As a user you may grant any contract with access to your account (which still prevents token locking) for the benefits you've mentioned.

This isn't true. There will still be a private key somewhere with access to the tokens, which means there's no way to use any other form of security exclusively. If someone gets access to the private key, it's game over. 

(It's also just annoying that I have to generate a private key just for your one dapp, rather than using the security system I use for literally everything else.)

> Not sure why EIP 101 should break this? The transaction will still have a signer and the contract invocation will still have a caller.

I don't know exactly what the semantics will be, but either `tx.origin` will be the origin address, in which case it is useless for telling who sent it, or it will be the address of the contract that pays the gas, in which case it could easily be the sort of contract you're hoping to prevent.

You may generate a key, create an account, grant account access to any contract you like and immediately destroy the key. 
The trick is you can't prove others you have destroyed the key and thus the tokens can't be assumed locked. So any token transfer should be still performed via the Token contract and transfer fees get paid. 
Can you please tell what security system are you referring? 

EIP 101: Do you mean this change is going to be VM backward incompatible?

Yeah, that works I guess, though you have to hope that you didn't leak the key during the creation and signing phase. Not as secure as I'd like, but not terrible.

> Can you please tell what security system are you referring?

I don't have one set up yet, so I was referring to the hypothetical future. But any security system based on smart contracts, which will be pretty much any of them. For instance, anything with a multisig component, or anything where you can change keys or where you have "emergency override" keys. We're building this sort of system at Ownage for our users, and there will be lots more coming out in the near-to-medium-term future. The Mist multisig wallets are a simple example of this pattern.

> EIP 101: Do you mean this change is going to be VM backward incompatible?

Well, it's definitely backwards incompatible (until now all transactions had to be signed in a specific format, after EIP 101 any transaction is potentially valid regardless of signature). But in this specific case, it's not the backwards incompatibility that's the problem, but the general functionality implied by the EIP. Since you can have your "account" work based on any code you write, the "account" can become the sort of derivative you don't want.

@PeterBorah:

It would definitely make sense starting a list of possible breaking changes and have them in the next version. Since we're following semver, 0.4.x could have breaking changes.

I would include not only security related changes, but remove any possible dead weight which could be a burden in the future evolution of the language.

@chriseth would it make sense having a separate issue opened for it or a git issue tag is sufficient? Judging by a quick browse there are plenty of proposed breaking changes.

Yes, such a list makes sense. I actually prefix all PRs that introduce breaking change with `BREAKING`.

As far as tx.origin is concerned, I am still not convinced that banning it to inline assembly is a good thing. If you do access control, then every single example uses `msg.sender` and not `tx.origin`. We also don't forbid users to do access control using passwords in contracts, but we tell users in the documentation not to do it.

I'm fine with adding a static analysis check in browser-solidity to search for `tx.origin`, but I would not want to remove it from the language.

There are lots of things that Solidity doesn't allow you to do. It's a statically typed language! This is the same sort of thing: `tx.origin` is a bug that is can be detected at compile time. 

I'm sympathetic to the argument that power is more important than safety, but that doesn't seem to be Solidity's philosophy in any other situation.

I don't know if it's more user-friendly, but it's definitely more secure. If your token contract checks `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`, then any contract you ever call can steal your tokens, even if you thought you were just breeding some digital cats.

User friendliness is easy to handle in the interface. No reason to compromise security to do it.

@PeterBorah I agree though security shouldn't be comprimised, and it could probably be easier done in the interface, its better to keep the Solidity attack vectors small

That definitely helps, but then the attack flow is:

You -> `EvilCryptoKitties` -> `ApprovedReceiverContract` -> `Token`

You're the `tx.origin`, so `EvilCryptoKitties` can act on your behalf and send your tokens to themselves.

This doesn't work if `ApprovedReceiverContract` checks `msg.sender`, but at that point you're just trusting all of the security to `ApprovedReceiverContract`, so why not just remove the false security provided by `tx.origin` like this:

```
remoteApprove(_spender, _owner){
  require(approvedReceiver(msg.sender));
  allowance[_owner][_spender] = _value;
}

why would I send a transaction to `EvilCryptoKitties` in that contract pretend they have

```
function payable(){
  owner.transfer(msg.value * 100)

In this scenario `tx.origin` is not the problem but interacting with the bad contract is 

the flow is `Me` -> `ApprovedReceiveContract` -> `Token`

it is still two transactions either way, so its better to have the safer msg.sender

You would call `EvilCryptoKitties` because you want to breed lovely digital kitties, of course.

They can't do your `owner.transfer(msg.value * 100)` in any other case because the contract doesn't have the right to transfer on behalf of your account. The only way they get that ability is if you use the insecure `tx.origin`.

No, it mostly can't do bad things if contracts follow basic security practices like not using `tx.origin`. It can't act on your behalf, or move your ether, unless you choose to send it ether. It can only change its own internal state and make calls that set itself as the `msg.sender`. You don't normally have to audit a smart contract to make sure it can't steal your tokens, you just trust that the tokens have reasonable security and your tokens will be safe regardless.

What did you think of my suggestion that you just trust `ApprovedReceiveContract` entirely, rather than having the useless `tx.origin` check?

Maybe an audit is not needed but verification will help to be on the safe side. For example ICO website can get hacked and a contract address can be changed to a malicious contract that accepts Ether and doesnt transfer tokens,

In your example the owner param can be changed by the malicious contract, in my suggestion, tx.origin can not be changed
```
interface token (){
  remoteApprove(address spender, uint value)
}

contract TokenReceiver {
 function TokenReceiver(address addressOfToken){
   tokenReward = token(addresOfToken)
  }
   
   function approveRemoteTransfer(uint value){
     tokenReward.remoteApprove(this, value)
  }
}
```
1) interact approveRemoteTransfer

```
remoteApprove(_spender){
  require(approvedReceiver(msg.sender));
  allowance[tx.origin][_spender] = _value;
}
```
2. `msg.sender` is the contract `TokenReceiver`, `tx.origin` is the `msg.sender` from `TokenReceiver`

@PeterBorah I will just remain as compliant to ERC-20 token in case `tx.origin` becomes deprecated, I can also run a rinkeby contract to see if you can exploit it

There are legitimate use cases for `tx.origin`, it is silly to try and remove this just because people can shoot themselves in the foot with it. It may be 'bad security practice' with many use cases, but `msg.sender` isn't appropriate for others and must remain usable when necessary.

For example, I want to verify the call chain of a transaction, to ensure that it originated from a user, and that it passed through exactly two other contracts (which are on my whitelist) before reaching me.

No, you would not need that, even worse, it is really a bad idea.

You should keep msg.sender by using a trusted proxy contract and then you can verify that msg.sender is approved proxy contract and then you have original sender as an argument to transaction.

On the other hand, if you use tx.origin, you allow any contract deployed on the blockchain to be a proxy, meaning someone wants to buy a CryptoDog or play with some stupid game and that contract could act on behalf of the user, if you rely on tx.origin. Please, don't do that.

+1 for removing tx.origin

This is a valid use case, as I said before - I don't think it's justified to remove useful functionality solely to prevent people from shooting themselves in the foot.

In reposte, I propose to remove `malloc` from C, because it often leads to memory leaks.

I oppose the idea of removing tx.origin, Many users do utilize it for different checks. msg.sender couldn't be an alternative to tx.origin as both serve a different purpose.

Using tx.origin == msg.sender is extremely useful. For example lets say I want a function that can ONLY be called by a private key and not a contract. For example, I'm writing a BitBay bridge for my coin with a dynamic matrix-like supply and want to list on Uniswap so I have a whitelist system for typical erc20 calls like transferfrom and want to detect deposits to the AMM. Thus I register it in my contract by detecting LP token shift on Uniswap and last user to interact with AMM and issue special LP coins that match the matrix(either that or convince every AMM we wanna list to change which is impossible). Therefore I want to deny new AMM that aren't registered because their misunderstanding of the dynamic supply can cause losses(supply shift causes array elements to be inappropriately understood by LP pool ratio and only array of LP ratios by our contract can fix it). Even more frustrating that anyone can open an AMM pair on another exchange not knowing risk. The typical ERC20 functions are therefore intentionally only allowed to be used by a user (tx.origin == msg.sender) OR a whitelisted contract. Contract can automatically be notified on new attempt to interact. Whitelisting can of course be voted in democratically (the users agree its not an AMM). This does not limit other contracts by the way. Other contracts can use the typical ERC20 functions except they call them using another name (like saying transferfrom2 instead of transferfrom). Thus the coin has its own methods for sending not breaking any potential custom contracts that understand the special matrix-like balances!

As far as I know (please someone correct me if I'm mistaken) there is only ONE way to know if a user is NOT a contract and thats tx.origin==msg.sender. Removing tx.origin will break anything that needs to know that info and those contracts may not be able to easily figure out if user isn't a contract.

Granted we can just let LPs know to tread with caution when attempting to deposit to other protocols but this eventually means we would need a feature to freeze misbehaving accounts(horrible solution). Or "let the buyer beware" that they didn't read the code. Well I would much rather limit this specific coins erc20 functionality and add a second way to access the coins functions(or ask to be whitelisted). Adding a way to bypass the check means users can of course still use all functionality with contracts but at least existing contracts can still be used not preventing listings on AMMs. Removing tx.origin will break this functionality. I don't see how removing it to "protect users from themselves" makes sense when you only need to issue a warning. Can't the warning detect that tx.origin is being used to see if its msg.sender or not?! Is there an alternative way to get tx.origin via assembly so if its removed my contract doesn't break? Or is there an alternative way to guarantee msg.sender isn't a contract?

I concur, malloc is really dangerous.

As a Solidity developer, I think it is expected of you to know the pitfalls and the limitations of any function or code you write.
In some instances there are no bad consequences of a "bad" function (such as tx.origin) being used.
Removing it or changing its functionality is not the way to go.

In my contract I assume that "tx.origin == msg.sender" could be completely manipulated but it does not matter in my particular instance.
It is not used for security purposes.

I have used it as `require( msg.sender == owner && tx.origin != msg.sender )` leaving it to you to reason its usage.

I have seen it used too as `require( tx.origin == msg.sender )` for efficiency purposes and in the corresponding infinite though processes of each programmer.

Breaking contracts in a blockchain where code is immutable is just a mistake, is a NEVER do that. This is even more critical when this discussion is about personal taste. Making not expert users see their funds lock, because his transaction that previously worked and now after your quest is successful it won't ever succeed, is morally wrong.

The logic behind that you believe that other programmers make mistakes in their code, makes `delegatecall`, `call` and practically every feature that is corruptible be subject to the same treatment.
