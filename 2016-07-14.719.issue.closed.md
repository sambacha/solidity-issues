# [\#719 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/719) `closed`: How are opcodes converted to EVM bytecode?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20244864?v=4" width="50">[yiimi](https://github.com/yiimi) opened issue at [2016-07-14 01:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/719):

I'm trying to figure out how EVM opcodes are translated into bytecode. I think Solidity compiles down to LLL and LLL then translates this into bytecode, but I haven't found that yet in the source code. Will someone please point me to a specific spot in the source code?
