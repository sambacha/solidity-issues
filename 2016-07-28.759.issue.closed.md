# [\#759 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/759) `closed`: JSON output: inconsistent field names

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-07-28 17:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/759):

The current output fields for a contrcat are:
- assembly
- bytecode
- functionHashes
- gasEstimate
- interface
- opcodes
- runtimeBytecode
- solidity_interface
- srcmap
- srcmap-runtime

This doesn't seems to be consistent.  Using dashes (srcmap-runtime) is a bit inconvenient in JSON also.

Is there a way this could be streamlined in the future?
