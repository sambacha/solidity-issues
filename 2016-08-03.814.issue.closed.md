Hi,

I can't compile the contract documentation for our Dao. Without it is ok.

The source is here : https://github.com/pacifics/Dao

Please provide more information. Do you get a compiler error? Which compiler do you use?

Sorry, but I'm really not sure if this is the correct place for your build issue. Do you think this might  be a bug in the compiler? If not, please ask for help on gitter or stackexchange.

I would recommend closing this issue. It seems that https://github.com/pacifics/Dao has been updated recently, presumably to fix this issue.
