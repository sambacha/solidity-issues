# [\#827 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/827) `closed`: Incorrect use of built-in 0x4 Identity Function

According to this comment: https://github.com/ethcore/parity/issues/1819#issuecomment-237303440 solidity sometimes make use of the 0x4 identity function. But does so incorrectly providing too little gas. Is it intended or not? Does it harms the execution in any way?
Note: that failed internal tx's to 0x4 will soon be removed from etherscan.io.

It seems that the YP defines the gas requirements for the identity precompile as `15` + `3` every 32 bytes of data.

While Solidity uses `3` as a base fee + `15` as a word fee. (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp)

The actual bug seems to be trying to copy 0 bytes, because in that case the total gas stipend is 3 (15 correctly) and from 1+ bytes on Solidity over-stipends (15_i vs 3_i).

Another bug I see here is that I think identity memcpy shouldn't be called for length 0.

Also fixed it in #828.

Furthermore, I think the identity function is more expensive than copying manually - we have a story for that.
