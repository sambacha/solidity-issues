# [\#887 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/887) `closed`: Simple peephole optimizer if the main optimizer fails

There are quite some situations where the main optimizer fails to operate, which always results in a full basic block being unoptimized. We should add a peephole optimizer to assist in such situations.

@chriseth says `push x; pop` appears often currently.

This optimizer could also use the rules in ExpressionClasses for local simplifications.

Is this the reason in some cases the optimiser fails to replace `EXP` by `PUSH`? It seems that usually it can replace `2 250 EXP`, but won't take `250 2 EXP`. The rule is with `powm()` so it should handle it.

There is a tradeoff between deploy-time costs and run-time costs. We currently use a crude heuristic and its parameter can be modified using the `--optimize-runs` switch.

We now have a simple such optimizer, but we should still add the rules from ExpressionClasses.cpp.

@chriseth is this still valid? If yes, I'd still propose to close this and to create a specific issue explaining what needs to be done.

We added the rules to the iulia optimizer, so I think this is as for as we will go.
