Currently, libraries are not allowed to inherit or be inherited. I believe that libraries should be allowed to inherit from each other.

A use-case of this would be as follows:

I am currently writing an [implementation of state channels](https://github.com/ledgerlabs/toy-state-channels) and for my `Adjudicator` to check if a `bytes32[]` is newer than a previously submitted one, it has to make a call to `CompareOp`. However, in the case where we're working with nonces, `CompareOp` would be an instance of [`NonceCompareOp`](https://github.com/ledgerlabs/toy-state-channels/blob/master/contracts/NonceCompareOp.sol), which you can see has to inherit but remains stateless.

Since `CompareOp` (and all children) are assumed to be stateless contracts, though, it would be more prudent to have only one instance of each child (as a library). Unfortunately, it is not possible to create inheritable libraries and, thus, I have to write them as contracts.

This was in the original design of libraries, of which only a part is implemented for now. The design document was put on a site that went down in the meantime, but I hope I still have it somewhere.

In general, the complication with libraries inheriting is that you lose the ability to use virtual functions. This is fine as long as you do not allow those functions to be overwritten. contracts and libraries can inherit from each other, and also libraries can have state variables as long as the layout of state variables in storage is preserved when inheriting.
