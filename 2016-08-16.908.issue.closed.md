The current why3 code generator directly translates the AST into why3 source code. It would be better if we would at least support basic data structures like semicolon-separated sequences and space-separated elements in paretheses. Depending on the syntax of why3, the support can of course also be larger.

Why3 will be removed, so closing this.
