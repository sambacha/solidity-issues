# [\#917 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/917) `closed`: Update documentation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-08-17 09:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/917):

The full documentation should be re-read so that examples and text do not contain or explain features that were removed. Furthermore, the version pragma should be added at least to the more complex examples. Finally, change the default contract of browser-solidity to include a version pragma.
- [x] update docs
- [ ] update browser-solidity default contract
