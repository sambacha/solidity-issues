# [\#974 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/974) `closed`: When an array is in a struct it should be possible to specify the number of bytes used to store the length

Array lengths are always stored as a single slot. Often 1 to 3 bytes would be sufficient. It would be great if the maximum length could be specified and the length state be packed into a struct.

Currently this requires a lot of custom coding.

What is the goal you want to achieve here? The array length deliberately occupies a full slot so that offsets of the data area (= sha3 of the length slot) are unique.

In [this contract](https://github.com/bluedroplet/blobstore-ethereum/blob/master/blobstore.sol) I packed the length of the packedRevisionBlockNumbers mapping (numRevisions) into the struct. If I used the built-in array functionality the struct would be 2 slots instead of 1.

This adds a complication that is only beneficial in very specific cases. Closing.
