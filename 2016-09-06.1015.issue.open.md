# [\#1015 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1015) `open`: Replace _ with body in modifiers
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

To make the code a bit less cryptic:

```
modifier owneronly {
    if (address != msg.sender) {
        throw;
    }

    body;
}
```

(Follow up of #535)

So 'body' will be a keyword?

How about "yield"? It's a common used keyword and generally well understood.

I don't think `yield` matches this use-case. Furthermore, I think we should stay with using a symbol. Admittedly, `_` is not really "visible" (depending on your font), but words do not stand out as well, I would say.

The proper way to do this would be:

```
modifier owneronly[f] {
     if (address != msg.sender) {
        throw;
    }
    f();
}
```

and this also allows us to do

```
modifier owneronly[body] {
     if (address != msg.sender) {
        throw;
    }
    body();
}
```

and `modifier owneronly` would be identical to `modifier owneronly[_]` at which point we could even achieve backwards-compatibility.

(in all cases, the fact whether `()` should or has to be specified is debatable)

@obscuren I like `yield` but it could mislead into thinking that coroutines are supported.

@chriseth your proposal is nice, but how many people would actually use it? The default behaviour should reduce the possibility of errors.

@axic we can report a warning if `[]` is not used.

I still say there's nothing wrong with the `_`.

I think it could be an acceptable way to go this way. Though we could start issuing a warning for `_` and switch to `body` in the next breaking.

How would it look with param arguments with modifiers in this proposed schema?

I would like to revive this discussion.

Instead of making the modifier explicitly mention the function, how about the other way around? That is, a modifier states a condition, and the function decides how to use it, for example as a pre or post condition.

```
modifier owneronly {
  require(owner == msg.sender);
}
modifier magic(uint x) {
    require(x == 0xcafe)
}
function f(uint x) pre[[owneronly, magic(x)]] public view {...}
```

This starts to get mixed up with invariants though...

Before we had require, modifiers were used in a very different way. We should collect the current use-cases for modifiers and then maybe restrict the syntax to "pre-conditions, potentially with side-effects" only.

Agree!
