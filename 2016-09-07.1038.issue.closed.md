# [\#1038 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1038) `closed`: formal verification: specify evaluation order of arr[i++] = i

The effect of the expression `arr[i++] = i` is different depending on the evaluation order of the index `i++` and the right hand side `i`.  If the index is evaluated before the right hand side, an incremented value is assigned.

This is similar to #1037 . I think whatever we document, it would be best to catch such cases and report them as a warning, but I fear that we need a formal verification engine to do this.

OK.  For now I'm fine with disallowing multiple side-effects in an expression.

Let me think about how to detect these.
