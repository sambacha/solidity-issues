Calling foo with the address of Events (`test_contract.foo(events_contract.address`) will fail at runtime with OOG if I return a, b, c, d, e:

```
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash) returns (int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {}
}
```

```
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash)
        returns (int a, int b, int c, int d, int e);
}

contract test {
  function foo(address addr) {
    Events events = Events(addr);
    var (,,,,) = events.getEvent(0);
  }
}
```

However, if I remove e from contracts and do the same transaction it works:

```
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash) returns (int a, int b, int c, int d) {}
}
```

```
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash)
        returns (int a, int b, int c, int d);
}

contract test {
  function foo(address addr) {
    Events events = Events(addr);
    var (,,,) = events.getEvent(0);
  }
}
```

I added the two sources to this gist for testing:
https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/#version=soljson-latest.js&optimize=true&gist=a7010392fd44542a8ff1e2ab3fd405d5

Tested with:
`Version: 0.4.0+commit.acd334c.Linux.g++`
`Version: 0.4.1-develop.2016.09.09+commit.79867f4.Linux.g++`

Since 0.4.0 there's a check to see if code exists at the specified address. If not, there's an invalid jump ("oog").

Practically that means you cannot use `test` with a random address in browser-solidity, you do need to deploy `Events` and supply the appropriate address.

True, but you can deploy code with browser-solidity and pass the address. The issue also appears when executing the code in a pyetheruem test environment.

Your above example can be deployed, because `Events` is abstract.

I don't have the issue you're reporting (neither 4 or 5 arguments work, because of the invalid address). If I deploy a non-abstract `Events`, it works.

Try to deploy the first two contracts:

```
// This is not abstract {}!
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash) returns (int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {}
}
```

```
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash)
        returns (int a, int b, int c, int d, int e);
}

contract test {
  function foo(address addr) {
    Events events = Events(addr);
    var (,,,,) = events.getEvent(0);
  }
}
```

And you will see that calling foo in the 2nd contract will cause OOG if you pass the address from the first contract.

On `solc` from `ethereum/develop` and `geth 1.5.0-unstable`, I [could not](https://gist.github.com/pirapira/9fb9cb3166d22cb0337b02de2e8d1b1f) reproduce this.  The link contains the commands I typed into RPC.

Thanks for checking @pirapira. I haven't tested it against geth, but it fails in browser-solc and with pyethereum.

In browser `foo` returns OOG for the `int a, int b, int c, int d, int e` version and "0x" for the `int a, int b, int c, int d`.

@Georgi87 are you sure that a valid `Events` contract is deployed and passed to `test()`? The `Events` contract you have is abstract and therefore won't compile and cannot be deployed.

Yes, I am sure. The abstract `Events` contract in the 2nd contract is just added to allow interfacing the actually deployed `Events` contract.

This deployed `Events` contract is not abstract:

```
// This is not abstract because it has a body {}!
contract Events {
    function getEvent(bytes32 eventHash) returns (int a, int b, int c, int d, int e) {}
}
```

If there are issues reproducing this issue with browser-solc or pyetheruem I am ready to help. Ping me on gitter.

I was able to reproduce this with `0.4.1+commit.4fc6fc2c.Emscripten.clang`. I can't do much more now, maybe next week.

The root cause here is that the memory resize costs are not properly taken into account for the return value. Before 0.4.0 we retained more gas with a call (not because of potential memory resize but because of potential account creation).

Probably the best solution here would be to touch the memory before the call, though https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/90 would be a better solution.
