**Labels**: `enhancement`

Option 1: introduce a new keyword, which is a jump to the errortag:

```
assembly {
  throw
}
```

Option 2: expose the `ErrorTag` as a jump label to inline assembly:

```
assembly {
  jump(ErrorTag)
}
```

`define throw() { jump(invalidLabel) }`

As we will have functions soon, this can be closed. Inline assembly should have as few built-in features as possible to remain as flexible as possible.
