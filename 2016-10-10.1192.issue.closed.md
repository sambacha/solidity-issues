In `develop`, a malformed pragma that finishes with a `;` is interpreted as a version pragma.

```
$ cat test.sol 
pragma some sentence;
$ solc/solc test.sol 
test.sol:1:1: Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.4.3-develop.2016.10.10+commit.aa8832d6.mod.Linux.g++ - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
pragma some sentence;
^-------------------^
```

It would seem that I am having the same issue. 

```
./contracts/interfaces/BaseOwnedSet.sol:1:1: Error: Source file requires differentcompiler version (current compiler is 0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a.Darwin.appleclang - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;
```

is this a related bug ?

What you are seeing is the regular error that is expected from the pragma. The `^` means that anything never than `0.4.*` is not allowed, and you are using verison 0.5.0 of the compiler.
