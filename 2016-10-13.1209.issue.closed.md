# [\#1209 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1209) `closed`: doc: "code of internal library functions will be pulled into" is ambiguous
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

In `contracts.rst`, there is a phrase

```
In order to realise this in the EVM, code of internal library functions
(and all functions called from therein) will be pulled into the calling
contract and a regular ``JUMP`` call will be used
```

I guess this `pulled into` happens at the deployment time, and I guess the sentence can be clearer about this.

No, it happens at compile time.
