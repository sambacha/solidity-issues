# [\#1248 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1248) `closed`: Do not use the memcopy precompile

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-10-19 15:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1248):

The identity / memcopy precompile has always been quite expensive but it got even more expensive with EIP150. We should probably replace all its uses by a manual implementation.

An explicit gas cost calculation should be made before this change.
