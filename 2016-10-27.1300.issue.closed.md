Hello,

I tried to build `tags/v0.4.3` on Windows following wiki instructions. I got error:

```
CMake Error at cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake:183 (string):
  string sub-command REPLACE requires at least four arguments.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
CMakeLists.txt:18 (include)
```

Full trace is here:

I see same question is asked here:
https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/10038/no-cmake-cxx-compiler-could-be-found

Thanks,
Stan
