# [\#1336 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1336) `closed`: Incorrect Public Getter Created for Static Array

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7756785?u=2893ea91743ac89ee3846d1f5c7209720e834129&v=4" width="50">[VoR0220](https://github.com/VoR0220) opened issue at [2016-11-07 22:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1336):

It would appear that currently the ABI we get from a contract such as this:

```
contract SimpleConstructorArray {
  uint[3] public storedData;

  function SimpleConstructorArray(uint[3] x, uint[3] y) {
    storedData = x;
  }
}
```

returns something like this: 

```
======= SimpleConstructorArray =======
Contract JSON ABI
[{"constant":true,"inputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"name":"storedData","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name":"get","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256[3]"}],"payable":false,"type":"function"},{"inputs":[{"name":"x","type":"uint256[3]"},{"name":"y","type":"uint256[3]"}],"type":"constructor"}]
```

I don't think storedData in this instance should be taking a uint as input to find the index value, rather it should take no inputs and return the entire static array. Looking to see if anyone agrees with this?

The ABI and the code matches. This is the current behaviour and it mentioned in the documentation: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html?highlight=accessor#arrays

> It is possible to mark arrays public and have Solidity create an accessor. The numeric index will become a required parameter for the accessor.

Changing it is a breaking change and is not possible currently for variable length arrays (at least other contracts would have a hard time retrieving them).

Correct that its not possible for variable length arrays but i strongly feel like for static arrays this ought to be doable.

@VoR0220 I think it would need to be a new feature. Do you have any ideas for notation?

What do you mean by notation?

@VoR0220 I think if this would change, we would still need to support the current behaviour too.

I would refrain from changing the default behaviour of `public` for arrays now, because that is a breaking change across contracts (and not limited to a single contract compilation. It is possible to remove the `public` keyword entirely, but changing the behaviour of it is risky.

Therefore a new notation is neede to support the retrieval of arrays as arrays.

Perhaps replacing `public` with these could make sense:
- `getter`: `uint[3] getter data;` generates `function data() returns (uint[3]);`
- `itemgetter` or `indexedgetter`: `uint[3] itemgetter data;` generates `function data(uint index) returns (uint);`
