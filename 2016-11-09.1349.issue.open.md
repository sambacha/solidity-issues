# [\#1349 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1349) `open`: Short notation for function types
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

Function types require quite a lot of keystrokes. The obvious shorthand is
`(uint) -> (uint)`, but our function types are more complicated than javascript's - we also need to specify internal / external, constant, payable (view, pure). Is there a good notation for these?

We could distinguish internal and external by `->` and `=>` and then something like this:

`(uint) [pure,payable]=> (uint)`

This seems like it adds complication without a lot of real value.
- Pros:
  - Fewer keystrokes
  - Function definitions get shorter
- Cons:
  - Anything that parses source code has to now account for this notation and the old.
  - Mental overhead.  People have to understand that there are two ways to define functions.

I think the mental overhead is actually reduced:
```js
library ArrayUtils {
  // internal functions can be used in internal library functions because
  // they will be part of the same code context
  function map(uint[] memory self, function (uint) returns (uint) f)
    returns (uint[] memory r)
  {
    r = new uint[](self.length);
    for (uint i = 0; i < self.length; i++) {
      r[i] = f(self[i]);
    }
  }
```
vs.
```js
library ArrayUtils {
  // internal functions can be used in internal library functions because
  // they will be part of the same code context
  function map(uint[] memory self, (uint) -> (uint) f)
    returns (uint[] memory r)
  {
    r = new uint[](self.length);
    for (uint i = 0; i < self.length; i++) {
      r[i] = f(self[i]);
    }
  }
```
and this is only a simple example, one of the more complex being
```js
contract C {
  function f3() internal returns (function() returns (function () returns (function () returns (uint))));
```
vs
```js
contract C {
  function f3() internal returns (() -> (() -> (() -> (uint))));
```
 

Note that this is ONLY about function types, not about function declarations.

I completely misunderstood the intent of this. Disregard my injections. I'm
+1 on this notation.
