When multiple values are packed into one word, `OR`, `AND`, `DIV` and `MUL` instructions need to be used consistently.  Otherwise the neighboring values are tainted.  This issue keeps track of
* designing a language for predicates on stack elements ("least significant 14 bits are zero")
* adding a list of predicates in the compiler context to keep track of each stack element's possible value ranges
    * the predicates need to be updated whenever an instruction is appended
    * at `JUMPDEST`, knowledge might be lost.
* and checking the predicates during the value packing.
