With the addition of function types and the ability to store an internal function in storage, some assumptions that were made for the control flow graph optimizer were violated and thus it was disabled.

More specifically: The CFG unit assumed that a basic block that starts with a tag that is never pushed inside an assembly can be safely removed.

Since it can be that the tag is now pushed in the constructor, we cannot remove its basic block in the runtime part.

In order to fix this, we have to check for pushed tags across the full code unit.

Closing in favour of yul-based optimization.
