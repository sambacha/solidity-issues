# [\#1403 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1403) `closed`: Solidity keywords based on grammar.txt

The following keywords should not be used outside their context defined in grammar.txt, for example not as identifiers. Else-wise Solidity code can not be processed by lexical analysers based on lex-like programs.

Do I understand correctly that this issue is about adding these keywords in the documentation and adding checks against these keywords appearing as identifiers?

These would be in my opinion the requirements to support lex / yacc based parsers.

@walter-weinmann I am sure that this is already the case for most of these keywords. Can you create a subset of keywords where this is not the case?

Unfortunately, I think we already have quite a lot of other situations that cannot be properly parsed by parser-generator based parsers, and those are much harder to fix.

I could check all examples in the Solidity documentation and try to fix the problems. This would also be a good test for my parser. To make it a one time effort, we could perhaps also find a solution for my problems with the pragma directive (#1395). I could start immediately with this piece of work.

Let me know if you are interested.

If all the keywords you listed are part of the token list in Token.h, then it should be fine - the pragma is of course a special case.

Comparing Tokren.h and grammar.txt gives the following differences:

- missing in Token.h: `from`
- missing in grammar.txt: `assembly`, `default`, `null`, `payable`

Great, thanks a lot! `from` was deliberately not added to the list of keywords because it is a very common variable name.

Ok - then my parser is more restrictive than the compiler. I think this is not a big issue for my parser. But do we get the missing language constructs based on `assembly`, `default`, `null `and `payable `into grammar.txt?

@pirapira could you add the missing keywords to the documentation, please?

Payable is actually defined, but it has a typo: `' payable'`

@chriseth I added this task to my queue.  Looks like the first PR arrives tomorrow afternoon.

In `grammar.txt` I need to exclude keywords from the set of identifiers.

Can I use some syntax for excluding one syntactic category from another, like
```
Identifier = [a-zA-Z_] [a-zA-Z_0-9]* && ~Keyword
```
?

The alternative is to define `IdentifierStartingFromD` and so on, carefully avoiding the keywords.

Another alternative to let the keywords to be identifiers.  In this case, some keywords do not appear in `grammar.txt` at all.

It is very unusual to let keywords be identifiers - in this case at least yacc-like parsers cannot be used any more. There is no need in grammars suitable for yacc-like parsers to exclude keywords explicitly from identifiers.

@walter-weinmann Thank you.  Following your advice I didn't do anything to the definition of identifiers.
