# [\#1457 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1457) `closed`: Inline assembly variables names don't clash with instructions
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
assembly {
    let gas := 1
    call(gas, ...)
}
```

In this example `call(gas,...` will refer to the `gas` instruction as opposed to the variable. Similarly, `let call := 1` is accepted as valid too.
