# [\#1532 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1532) `closed`: remapping rules with directory names containing `=`; exclude them in the doc, or support them
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

In the documentation, in `docs/layout-of-source-files.rst`, it should be documented that the context dependent module remapping does not work when the context contains a `=` character.  In `develop` the following test fails.  I found this while reviewing #1525.

so here's what that actually is doing. a becomes the remapping and `:=s=s` the target. So it's doing its job...it's properly failing....but what did you have in mind that it should do?

In the context `a=`, the prefix `s` should be mapped to `s_1.4.6`.

okay, here's a better question: what is context `a=` in this instance? That would be a remapping under current definition?

`a=` is a directory.  I can create one like `mkdir a=`.

so what you're saying is that only the last `=` should be used to create a remapping in the full string, yes?

Maybe not, because the target can contain `=` too.  One way around is to introduce some escaping; `==` means a single `=`, perhaps.

Then it should be the first `=` defines the remapping so long as it's after the colon for context. Escaping might be something useful, but I'm feeling this might be overcomplicating things.

I think the current behaviour is fine (longest match goes to target, not path) and I also think it is fine to assume that `=` is not part of a path, so we do not really need an escape. Let's add a test nevertheless that enforces the current behaviour (unless there are arguments against).
