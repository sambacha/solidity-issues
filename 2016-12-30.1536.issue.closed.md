# [\#1536 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1536) `closed`: strings being prefixes of each other should be equal, but supposed to be different
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

In the documentation, `layout-of-source-files.html` contains this sentence:  `If remapping keys are prefixes of each other, the longest is tried first.`

When two strings are prefixes of each other, the two strings are equal (both the length and the contents are equal).  So this sentence should be saying something else.

I think the intention was to say `If the remapping keys are not prefix-free, the longest is tried first` but make it understandable to non-theorists. We could just say `If multiple remappings can be applied, the one with the longest key is tried first.`

I like the last rephrasing.
