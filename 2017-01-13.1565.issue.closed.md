# [\#1565 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1565) `closed`: Disallow variables overriding internal or public functions during inheritance
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `language design :rage4:`

On `develop` 8bdb99dcc5870268e68a42d8c567afa54f93a9b2 the following code compiles into a non-empty bytecode.

```
contract A {
    function f() returns (uint) {
        return 1;
    }
    function g() returns (uint) {
       return f();
    }
}

contract B is A {
    uint public f;
}
```

A function `f` in `A` is overridden by a public state variable in `B`.

* [ ] what does the documentation say about this case
* [ ] add a test according to the documentation.

We should treat variables overriding functions as an error in the next breaking version.

Why should this be disallowed? If public state variables generate functions they should be treated like any other function.

Public state variables generate functions which are not accessible from inside the contract.  So, not "like any other function", but maybe "like any other public function".

But according to the solidity docs public functions can be called internally too.

> Public functions are part of the contract interface and can be either called internally or via messages. For public state variables, an automatic getter function (see below) is generated.

Public state variables create external functions, not public functions.

Ah, I understand then. Thank you.

I guess we could clarify this to be "an automatic external getter".

I don't think the getter is particularly automatic compared with other functions.  So, "an external getter function is generated automatically".

Similarly, automatic getter functions do not implement interface methods, but they should. Example:

```
interface A {
  function decimals() public view returns (uint8);
}
contract B is A {
  uint8 public constant decimals = 1;
}
```

There were some requests to keep getters being valid as external functions - have we taken a decision on this? I.e. is it fine to "implement" an external interface function using a getter?

Issue #3675 is related but not a duplicate.  The behavior I'd most expect, and which I think offers developers the best amount of flexibility, is for the compiler to behave as if the automatically-created getter were already there before considering inheritance, and then have that function in B override the one from A.

Fixed in latest version.
