# [\#1572 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1572) `closed`: Set up a testing infrastructure with different platforms
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

Solidity should be compiled on different platforms as part of the CI (already done) and the tests should be run on each of the platforms, comparing the resulting bytecode.

 - [x] generate and store code for linux
 - [x] generate and store code for emscripten
 - [x] generate and store code for windows
 - [x] generate and store code for macos
 - [x] all of the above with and without optimizer
 - [x] job that performs comparisons (should run for each push and check complete data, but also daily to see if data is incomplete)

--
Probably it would make sense setting up a testing infrastructure to run solc-js, solc@linux and solc@windows, both with gcc and clang, against some contracts to ensure that solc always behaves the same.

Note: we already test linux-gcc, linux-clang and windows-msvcc, but don't compare that against solc-js.

Does it make sense to include osx-clang too? It shouldn't be hard to setup with Travis.

@federicobond Mac is already supported, but was disabled due to being too slow on the CI (~40 mins or so).

Either we could:
1) speed it up and reenable it
2.a) add Emscripten compilation and
2.b) run the Solidity tests against solc-js

Probably 2.b doesn't really belong here and thus it should be a separate project, but 2.a could be very useful to at least.

@axic I don't think there is a way in travis to take the build artifact from two steps and have another step that uses it. We could download and execute solc-js in the ubuntu build and vice-versa, but that will trigger errors if we change something in the code generator. So unless travis supports some kind of complex build artefact generation paths, the only way I see is to do something like setting up a separate repository with separately triggered build process that downloads the artifacts from travis...

Ok, just spent a little more thoughts on this. This is how it could work: If all parallel travis runs are successful, a "deploy" step is run. This deploy step will copy the build artifacts to a special github repository. That repository has a travis setup that will take the binaries and test them against each other. The only question I still have is whether the deploy step has access to all binaries or only to the binaries that correspond to that build step and if it is the latter how to synchronize uploading to the other github repository. I guess there should be a simpler solution :-)

god...Travis is so complicated in all the wrong ways....I've been reading over this documentation and trying to figure out what to do to make this work "just" right...and yea...if I'm going to be honest, the CI setup in general could probably use something of a makeover. BTW...do we still need to run the tests 3 times or has that generally been eliminated as a concern at this point?

Chris, there's a simpler way that doesn't involve pushing to a separate repository. We just need to find a way to `emscripten` soltest...so the tests would look like the following pseudo travis script:

```
Build:

Windows: gcc/clang
Use windows specific script

OS X: gcc/clang
Use OS X specific script

Linux: gcc/clang
Use Linux specific script

Emscripten: gcc/clang
Use emscripten specific script

Docs: whatever the docs generator does

Docker:
run Docker build with soltest enabled

Run:

(inside a script obviously)
soltest

Deploy: (this assumes all of them pass and that the branch that we want to merge to is either develop or release)

provider: script: (run both emscripten deploy and docker push)

provider: releases (github): push tarballs, zips, and dmgs
```


Granted...this is all easier said than done....requires quite a refactoring imo.

scratch the Travis bit for Windows...Travis doesn't support windows...but you get the high level idea of how this should work imo.

No, Travis does not support Windows, but we can set up AppVeyor to handle
that.

correct. My thoughts exactly. The good news is that the majority of the heavy lifting has already been done (deps installation in particular).

I figure since I'm doing the docker deployment, might as well make the entire thing better while I'm here. Shouldn't be too hard.

Note: we already have AppVeyor run the tests :)

We are only lacking:
- Mac tests (they are technically still in the tree, but disabled - no big hassle writing it)
- Emscripten tests (this needs to be written)

In order to do the Emscripten tests, as @VoR0220 mentioned, we could compile the testing framework with Emscripten. Probably that is one of the easiest ways.

I would still like to compare the binaries produced from the different platforms. I'm also pretty sure that his is much faster to do, since most time in the tests is not spent on compiling but rather executing the tests. It is enough to run the tests on a single platform and only compare the produced bytecode on the other platforms.

Are we talking about adding new tests to produce bytecode or taking the bytecode from the current tests?

I would prefer the latter. That's far easier to add to it. I think.

So I think I figured out why OS X was running so slow. The main problem centers around brew and the fact that we were upgrading all of Travis' brew suite...this led to insanely long times updating. I've fixed this but it's still fairly slow due to the cpp-eth dependency and how long this takes to build. I have an idea to make this thing run even faster for all builds. All we need is a properly pushed stable cpp-ethereum docker image. From there this becomes a trivial matter to solve.  It's also required for our docker deployment. So any chance we could get that up @chriseth ? After that it becomes a docker pull and we call the rpc of the cpp-eth image. Furthermore, it also enables us to test on multiple platforms and bypass travis' limitations. So...if someone has that it would be very appreciated.

Just to clarify...we do in fact already test the bytecode and assert that the bytecode will be X in many of the end to end tests...correct? So...im confused i guess. What needs to be added here outside of an emscripten soltest that also passes all the tests? Could we not assume logically that then the bytecode would be the same?

Ahhhhh...I reread it a couple times and now I think it makes sense at least for the end to end tests...this way we could segregate it from the rest of the normal tests, and set a flag to either give back the generated bytecode or to actually run the tests against the IPC. We then can deposit the generated bytecode into artifacts, upload them to an S3 instance where we then compare all the artifacts from different distros.

That said, I think that the rest of the tests that are not node reliant (tests that don't rely on the cpp-eth client for testing) definitely still need to be run. This might take a bit longer than I expected if that's the case.

EndToEnd tests generate bytecode but the actual tests run checks on the semantics of that bytecode. it might be challenging to find suitable identifiers for the generated bytecode.

Maybe it would also make sense running fuzzing (#1125) on these platforms?

Sorting this (https://github.com/ethereum/interfaces/issues/4) would also allow running the tests against cpp-ethereum and go-ethereum (possibly parity).

The comparison is broken - it does not compare the latest commit. Also, the repository currently grows and grows, we should clean (and rebase) it from time to time or use branches that are deleted after some time.
