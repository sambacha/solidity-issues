And include tests for all failure cases.

@hrkrshnn do you know if we check for error messages now?

There are some asserts in `libsolidity/interface/Natspec.cpp` for `@return`. In `libsolidity/parsing/DocStringParser.cpp` there are some parsing errors that are reported using `appendError()` function.

But I don't think there are parsing errors when a tag is repeated.

This https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8247 might be relevant for this.
