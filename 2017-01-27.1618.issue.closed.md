I would actually propose to extend it properly once we have EIP5/8.

I propose to remove it and we focus on #2296.

#2296 needs a factory contract, this is basically the same thing without a factory contract, but yes, let's first focus on the other one.

Do we agree to remove the clone binary functionality in 0.5.0 then?

One less unspecified feature to be maintained, so we can properly design it and reintroduce it.
