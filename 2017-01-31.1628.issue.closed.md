# [\#1628 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1628) `closed`: Feature request: Warn on missing return value

I find myself surprisingly often debugging problems that turn out to be caused by not putting "return" before the last line of a function. A warning for a function that declares a return type and doesn't actually return anything would be very helpful.

Can you give an example? Sounds like this should be an error.

Minimal example:

    contract BadAdder {
        function add(uint x, uint y) returns(uint) {
            x + y; // Always returns 0.
        }
    }

....yeah that should be an error. Idk why we don't do that already. Anybody disagree? Unless they are named variables, the return statement should be found somewhere in the block. While we're at it, we should mandate that if one of the return variables is named that all of them are named. This keeps a decent amount of backward compatibility while also putting in place sensible restrictions on the developer.
