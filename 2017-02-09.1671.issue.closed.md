**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The scanner has support for scientific notation (`1e1`, `1e-1`, `1e+1`, etc.), thought it is not currently working.

Is it something we want to support or should it be removed?

I approve adding support for scientific notation. It's easy to misread the number of zeros in big numbers.

Other languages also allow optional underscores as thousands separators, like this: `1_000_000`. We might want to consider those too.

This seems to be a bug in `RationalNumberType::isValidLiteral`, because the scanner seems to be correct.

I'm not sure we should push for the scientific notation, but would rather agree to have underscores.

This fits now quite nicely with decimal fixed point numbers, so yes, let's (re-)add it.

@axic what is the progress on this? I would like to get the next release as bug-free as possible. Is this considered as a bug or a missing feature?
