It would be nice to support underscores in number literals to have easily readable numbers: `1_000_000`.

Question:
- should it allow multiple underscores next to each other `1__000_____000`?
- should it allow underscores at arbitrary places `1_0_00_000_0_000`?

If we add such a thing, the only reasonable strategy would be to force all numbers except for the first into triples. What about fractional numbers?

Oh and to be honest, I find these underscores extremely ugly. What about `1 000 000`?

> What about fractional numbers?

I wouldn't allow fractional numbers if we're segmenting it with underscore.

I wasn't a big fan of the underscores, but it gained some following and is kind of understood what it means. Having whitespace could be confusing I think.

I don't think it makes sense to support this only for integers.

Here's Python's approach: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/

Has most of these questions covered.

I'd take the design from existing languages. Python's one looks good.

Note BTW that forcing triplets isn't super great, since in East Asia they separate zeros in quadruplets, and in India they do it in a third way, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Digit_grouping

@jtakalai Only hex numbers have strict validation. Decimal numbers don't have any such rules. So, any grouping rule should work.
