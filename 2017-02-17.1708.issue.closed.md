# [\#1708 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1708) `closed`: Solidity can't find contract name since 4.9, gets <stdin> instead
**Labels**: `waiting for more input`

I have Solc 4.6 on my machine and everything works. When I call `compiledContract = web3.eth.compile.solidity(sourceCode);`, the first attribute of `compiledContract` is my contract name: 

    {
      SampleContract: {
        code: "...",
       info: {...},
       ...
      }
    }

But on another machine that has 4.9, `compiledContract` looks like this:

    {
      <stdin>:SampleContract: {
        code: "...",
        info: {...},
        ...
       }
     }

And I cannot `compiledContract.<stdin>:SampleContrat` of course, in Geth I get `invalid token argument`. Why did `<stdin>` appear?

What could cause that? How do I revert to 4.6 manually? (With command line)

Sorry for the hassle, this change was needed to allow unambiguous contract names for larger projects. You can access the contract using `compiledContract['<stdin>:SampleContract']` but I would recommend not to use `eth_compile` at all and instead use `solc.js` directly.

Thanks for replying. I'm not familiar with `solc.js`, can it be used in Geth?

No, it can be used directly from javascript, please see https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js and don't hesitate to ask in http://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity

Closing due to inactivity.
