# [\#1762 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1762) `closed`: Re-add require and assert

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-03-08 16:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1762):

 - `require(bool)`: calls `revert()` if the argument is false
 - `assert(bool)`: invalid opcode if argument is false

require might receive an argument for an explanation message or error code in the future

I'm not sure if we had thought about `expect`.

According to *thesaurus.com*:

> Synonyms for ensure
> verb guarantee; make secure

> Synonyms for expect
> verb believe strongly; anticipate

> Synonyms for require
> verb need, want

> Synonyms for assume
> verb believe, take for granted

> Synonyms for assert
> verb insist, declare, maintain

Maybe we should look at dictionaries more often to make decisions quicker :)
