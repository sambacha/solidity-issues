# [\#1789 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1789) `closed`: Uninitialised storage references should not be allowed
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `breaking change :warning:`

Defining a struct instance within a function defaults to `storage`. This shouldn't be allowed.

```
contract c {
    struct s { uint a; }
    function f() {
        s x;
        x.a = 2;
    }
}
```

We already have a warning here. The reason I did not turn this into an error was that there are use-cases where the warning can only be suppressed in a weird way:
```
contract c {
    struct s { uint a; }
    mapping(uint => s) data;
    function f(uint i) internal returns (s) {
        s x;
        if (i % 2 == 1)
          x = data[10 * i];
        else
           x = data[i / 2];
        return x;
    }
}
```

The far more dangerous situation where we do not have a warning yet (I guess I missed that) is:
```
contract c {
    struct s { uint a; }
    function f() internal returns (s) {
    }
}
```

Storage references have to be assigned to at every point in the control flow they are used. This especially applies to functions returning storage pointers.

'Use after free' is out of scope for this task.

This has been fixed.

Will this become an error in future releases? I'm unsure of what "this has been fixed" means.

@microbecode yes, this will be a warning in future releases and an error starting from 0.5.0. Please try the nightly compiler builds if you want to check.

@chriseth  Will compiler throw error on below code from 0.5.0?
```
contract A {
   uint a = 0;

   function(){
      uint[] a;
      a[0] = 1;
   }
}
```

@sjmini yes, multiple.
