With metropolis, contracts are more or less stored by their code hash. This makes it possible to access libraries by their code and thus enable some kind of auto-linking feature.

For this to be really useful, we should perhaps turn off the metadata hash for library code.

With Constantinople's `CREATE2` opcode this might become a reality.
