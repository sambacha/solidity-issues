# [\#1802 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1802) `closed`: Better error reporting needed for invalid hex literal
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`, `difficulty: challenging`

```
contract C {
    function f() {
        hex"12345";
    }
}
```

`hex"12345"` is invalid, because it has to be even number of nibbles. The error generated is:
```
Untitled3:3:9: Error: Expected primary expression.
        hex"12345";
        ^
```

All parser errors are of this form and it is quite hard to improve them without a major refactoring.

I think we should have it as a long term goal.

Came here after mistakenly typing `hex("12345")` instead of `hex"12345"`. 

While troubleshooting I noticed that `hex($#$@#$#$ foo bar "12345" anything);` results in the same misleading `Error: Expected primary expression` error.

@chriseth I've been looking into it today, and I see the problem: `scanHexString` is responsible to converting the Hex token to a normal `StringLiteral`. This makes a lot of sense, since right now the compiler no longer has to take the Hex token into account (it is just a string after scan, after all).

I can tell that there is not much error reporting going on at the Scanner, other than returning the `Illegal`-token. This also makes sense, since up to this point, there was no need for more validation (tokens were small enough to make Parser.cpp report the errors).

The problem now is that since `Hex` is now just a `StringLiteral`, there's no way of knowing at the Parser-side if the hex is invalid (for whatever reason) or not.

I came up with a few different approaches to add better error reporting (the ones I like the most are on top), and would like you to look at it and tell me if I'm at the right track.

- Allow error reporting in scanner
  - Aside from returning a `Illegal`-token we also trigger validation errors on the Scanner. This allows us to further validate bigger/converted tokens like Hex.

- Move the Hex-conversion to Parser
  - Scanner will return `Hex`-tokens without converting them, but we will convert them to a `StringLiteral` at the Parser side, so we can show an error when nessecary.

- Create multiple `Illegal`-tokens like `IllegalHex`
  - We can then report the error on the Parser side.
  - I dislike this the most, as this can get messy very quickly, especially if we get this problem again (we could end up with dozens of `Illegal*` tokens.

I think we may better off introducing `HexStringLiteral` leaving the hex nibble processing to further layers. In that case we could issue nice errors in the `SyntaxChecker`.

@axic Thanks, I think that makes makes the most sense. It seems to be the closest to option 2. If no objections are made I'll experiment with that :)

Is this still open? You want the parser to throw a more concrete error? It is a compile error right? Contract must have even number of hex nibbles?

Should probably mention that the target in question here is called solc (solidity compiler) it took some wondering on my part lol. EDIT: but apparently there's plenty of other relevant code in all the other projects. It looks like I found an easy fix in theory, waiting to compile and see what kind of toString Token is working with. If I could get the original "12345" out of the token the solution is easy and simple.

Alas, I just get "ILLEGAL", I get it now. You don't want this triggering fatal errors do you? Would be nice to include this in a list of syntax errors... looks like I must delve into the syntax checker and pass this illegal token on somehow. Is there any other way to get an illegal token without triggering fatal errors?

Pretty sure I figured out a good way to go about this. Let's expand the Token macro with all sorts of more detailed types of errors and return them as the token type when scanning tokens. There is already a lot of control flow determining what type of token to return. Just return the right type and handle the new types you introduce where needed. Good simple code. Could abstract this stuff further I have an inkling, but it sounds like a good amount of work. The enum creating macro is epic and makes extending it this way easy.

@axic , @chriseth , would you be willing to adjust the bounty-value to the "challenging" difficulty?

I would have requirements within 7 days  (main requirement beeing https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1802#issuecomment-391543993), and the implementation within 14 days (estimated, usually I'm within estimations).

@vs77bb , I could not "start work" (kind of "another person is working on this" error).
