# [\#1821 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1821) `closed`: Assembly more stack height checks

The following checks should be added in the analysis phase of (non-strict) assembly:

 - [ ] the stack height never goes below the highest named stack slot
 - [ ] the stack height never goes below the initial stack height of the block

Since we now warn about loose assembly, I think this can be closed.
