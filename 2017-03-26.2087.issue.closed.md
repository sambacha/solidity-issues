# [\#2087 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2087) `closed`: Assembly: doc: inconsistent stack layout assumption for a label?
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44281?u=19789513178700ad73a6cf535a40fbbfdc1ad615&v=4" width="50">[pirapira](https://github.com/pirapira) opened issue at [2017-03-26 19:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2087):

In the documentation, in `assembly.rst`, a desugared example program contains inconsistent stack layout for a single label.

Below, I annotated the program with the assumed stack layouts at program positions.  `<?>` means that the stack contains one additional element compared to the start of the assembly.  `<?, ?>` means that the stack contains two additional elements compared to the start of the assembly.  `<?, $ret1, ?>` means that the stack contains three additional elements compared to the start of the assembly, and the second element is the jump tag for label `$ret1`.

The annotations `(1)` and `(2)` seem to indicate inconsistent requirements for the label `$endSwitch`.

```
    {
      mstore(0x40, 0x60)
      {
        let $0 := div(calldataload(0), exp(2, 226))
        <?>
        jumpi($case1, eq($0, 0xb3de648b))      // $case1 needs to accept stack layout <?>
        <?>
        jump($caseDefault)                                  // $caseDefault needs to accept stack layout <?>
        <?>
        $case1:   // $case1 should accept stack layout <?>
        {
          // the function call - we put return label and arguments on the stack
          $ret1 calldataload(4) <?, $ret1, ?> jump(f) // f needs to accept stack layout <?, $ret1, ?>
          // This is unreachable code. Opcodes are added that mirror the
          // effect of the function on the stack height: Arguments are
          // removed and return values are introduced.
          pop pop <?>
          let r := 0
          <?, ?>
          $ret1: // the actual return point
          <?, ?>
          $ret2 0x20 <?, ?, $ret2, ?> jump($allocate) // $allocate needs to accept stack layout <?, ?, $ret2, ?>
          <?, ?, $ret2, ?>
          pop pop let ret := 0
          <?, ?, ?>
          $ret2: // $ret2 should accept stack layout <?, ?, ?>
          mstore(ret, r)
          return(ret, 0x20)
          // although it is useless, the jump is automatically inserted,
          // since the desugaring process is a purely syntactic operation that
          // does not analyze control-flow
          <?, ?, ?>
          jump($endswitch) // $endswitch should accept stack layout <?, ?, ?> <----- (1)
        }
        <?>
        $caseDefault: // $caseDefault should accept stack layout <?>
        {
          jump(invalidJumpLabel) // $invalidJumpLabel should accept stack layout <?>
          jump($endswitch) // $endSwitch should accept stack layout <?>
        }
        $endswitch: // $endSwitch should accept stack layout <?> <------ (2)
```

Conclusion: The body of a case label has to go into its own block with the `jump to endswitch` outside of that block. This has to be fixed both in the example and in the description of the desugaring process.

The desugaring documentation has been removed, since we're going with Yul instead.

@chriseth can this be closed?
