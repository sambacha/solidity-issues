It would make sense to generate a target, with the same API as emscripten, for Webassembly.

Limitations:
- llvm/clang must be rolled by ourselves, because the target is experimental
- browsers don't have it enabled by default

It is also possible to compile through `emcc`, but that is suboptimal, because essentially it compiles asm.js to Webassembly and therefore the speed increase is way less than compiling C directly.

With #4441 we've merged in a version which supports outputting wasm.

Alternatively we could use latest clang where wasm isn't experimental anymore and compile with that.

As a side note, could also use https://github.com/wasmx/wasm-chisel/ for additional optimisations after clang/emscripten.
