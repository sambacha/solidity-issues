# [\#2116 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2116) `closed`: Warn for Inheritance same signature functions and variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/979444?v=4" width="50">[rolandkofler](https://github.com/rolandkofler) opened issue at [2017-04-11 13:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2116):


```
contract B {
    int public x=10;
    function b() returns (int){return x--;}
}
contract C {
    int public y =1;
    function b() returns (int) {return y++;}
}
contract A is B,C{
    int public z;
    function a(){
        z=b()+b();
    }

}
````
executing a() yields z=3;

reverting `is B,C` and a yields z=19;

But this is too confusing and helps to introduce bugs. Better warn if same signatures are detected

To be more precise: I assume this issue is about a warning in situations where functions are overwritten through multiple inheritance where there is no common base contract that also has the function.

I think this is a good idea for an external static analyzer, but it should not be part of the compiler. The reason is that if you want to use two base contracts that lie outside of your own project, you cannot modify their function names and name clashes might be unavoidable. Note that you can still access specific "instances" of `b` by using `A.b()` and `B.b()`.

As agreed in #2563 we should require qualified names when referring to such "conflicting" functions.

I've uploaded my thoughts on this issue [as a blog post](https://pdaian.com/blog/solidity-anti-patterns-fun-with-inheritance-dag-abuse/).  Specifically, I definitely support either the addition of warnings for multiple overrides at the same level of the developer specified inheritance graph.  Requiring unambiguous references to each potentially ambiguous method/field is also not a bad step, but it should be paired with explicit access to any superclass functions when, because of linearization, those functions will not be the ones in a class's explicitly stated superclass (in my blog post this is the case with the WhitelistedCrowdsale call; this class directly extends Crowdsale but its super reference will be to CappedCrowdsale because of linearization.  this should be required to be made explicit).

This issue has now been solved by requiring an explicit override in A:
```
contract A is B,C{
    int public z;
    function a(){
        z=b()+b();
    }
    function b() override(B, C) returns (int) { return B.b() + C.b(); }
}
```
