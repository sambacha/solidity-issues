# [\#2142 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2142) `closed`: AST inconsistency between gcc and clang

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-04-20 16:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2142):

clang:
```
{"children":[{"attributes":{"fullyImplemented":true,"isLibrary":false,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1],"name":"A"},"children":[],"id":1,"name":"ContractDefinition","src":"0:14:0"}],"name":"SourceUnit"}
```

gcc:
```
{"children":[{"attributes":{"fullyImplemented":true,"isLibrary":false,"linearizedBaseContracts":[1],"name":"A"},"children":[],"id":1,"name":"ContractDefinition","src":"0:14:1"}],"name":"SourceUnit"}
```

Note the `src` field differs, `0:14:0` vs `0:14:1`.

Which sources did you provide to the compiler? The last field is the source index and should be the index into the sorted list of the sources.

This is the culprit:

```
echo "contract A {}" | solc --combined-json ast -
```

It is created on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp#L406 and perhaps on GCC the rvalue does not evaluate to 0.
