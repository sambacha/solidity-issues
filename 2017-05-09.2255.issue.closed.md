This means no FFI here: https://github.com/ethereum/py-solc/issues/9

This is not part of the build system at the moment. Is it possible with Python FFI to load a shared library as is?

Yes, but this practically means shipping either the whole solidity source as a submodule or incorporating it into dependent project build processes to make platform wheels available on pip for example. In any case, just having it exposed to CMake should be enough if I'm not mistaken. I suppose there may be some documentation work that might need to be done before this is shippable as part of the official release depending on Solidity policies on the matter, but ultimately, I feel like addressing it here is the right way to go.

I fear providing such packages is currently out of scope.

Depends on #2864.

What is to be done here now that the dependency is closed?

I feel this issue is stale as it holds some outdated assumption, but the issue downstream may be addressed directly now. I've edited the link in the original post to point to the right location. Closing this now.
