# [\#2259 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2259) `closed`: dynamic array declaration and assign only one item compile error

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7549002?u=6771f9fbd349486f6aaff4a34da057fb426034d8&v=4" width="50">[yuanaichi](https://github.com/yuanaichi) opened issue at [2017-05-10 06:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2259):

below is my contract:
`
contract TransferContract {
  address owner;
  address[] public receivers = [
    0x6aebda91307743b691b57ce664cdbf24beb02b61
  ];
}
`

when receivers have only one item,  have a internal compile error like this

`Internal compiler error:
Compiliation failed. See above.`


when receivers have more than one item, no error

is this a bug??

Can you tell me what compiler version are you using? Cannot reproduce with 0.4.10 or 0.4.11.
