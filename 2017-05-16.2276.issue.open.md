It seems like the new standard JSON output format deserves an EIP.  Is this in the works?

I've started drafting up something, but the spec is in the flux at the moment and wouldn't want to finalise it yet. At the bare minimum the following must be sorted:
- Output target selection
- Input/output support for: Assembly, Julia, LLL
- Julia, EVM1.5, eWASM outputs

I'd imagine it will take a couple of Solidity releases before it is really stable, though we don't really expect breaking changes.
