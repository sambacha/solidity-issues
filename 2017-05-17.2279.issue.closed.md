# [\#2279 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2279) `closed`: Soltest fails against newer versions of cpp-ethereum

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/416212?u=1017126e3c4675ab2c77f1e4c0d0e31bed1fa6a7&v=4" width="50">[seusher](https://github.com/seusher) opened issue at [2017-05-17 15:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2279):

After starting cpp-ethereum with ```eth --test -d /tmp/testeth``` and then running soltest via ```./soltest -- --ipcpath /tmp/testeth/geth.ipc```, all ipc tests will fail when using a recent version of cpp-ethereum:

```
fatal error: in "SolidityAuctionRegistrar/creation": Error on JSON-RPC call: INTERNAL_ERROR: 
```

Here are logs generated by uncommenting the request logging in ```RPCSession::rpcCall```:

This issue was confirmed by chriseth on Gitter:

```chriseth @chriseth 01:17
@seusher yes, we noticed that, it happens with latest develop version of cpp-ethereum. You can make it work by using a slighttly older version of cpp-ethereum or wait for our fix
```

In order to make debugging easier, the Request and Response messages should be written via BOOST_TEST_MESSAGE so it logs according to the --log_level=message argument to soltest.

Building commit 4943d3eeae865537e18c410e5e7d064825bf2711 of cpp-ethereum allowed soltest to progress much further, though it still failed on a test_mineBlocks call, which caused cpp-ethereum's worker to die:

```
Request: {"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"test_mineBlocks","params":[1],"id":20}
Reply: {"id":19,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x1"}

/Users/seusher/Documents/git/solidity/test/RPCSession.cpp:264: fatal error: in "SolidityAuctionRegistrar/transfer": critical check rpcCall("test_mineBlocks", { to_string(_number) }, true) == true has failed

In case someone else wants to be able to easily see RPC requests/responses, I have created a pull request: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2280

Closing this since the message was added to the test suite and I've reported this on cpp-ethereum (https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4240).

@seusher please comment over there if this still persists.
