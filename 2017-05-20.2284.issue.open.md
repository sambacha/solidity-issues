Currently, the [typical javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp) `switch`-`case` statement yields an `Error: Expected primary expression.`. This would be nice to have for many applications.

This has not been added yet because some more research has to go into how to handle match expressions for sum types and destructuring.

It says the switch is added to 0.6.7. But remix compiler says Error: Expected primary expression when switch-case control structure is used. What should I do? #9647
