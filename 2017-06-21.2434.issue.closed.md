# [\#2434 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2434) `closed`: Add an error for tuple assignment with reference types

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-06-21 16:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2434):

Tuple assignments of the form `(x, y) = (y, x)` do not work if both `x` and `y` are storage reference types, but there is currently no warning. We should actually flag an error.

What should the actual condition be?

 - The number of variables of storage reference type is at least two on both sides

Perhaps "warn if at least one copy from storage to storage and another copy to storage (from whereever) happens)"
