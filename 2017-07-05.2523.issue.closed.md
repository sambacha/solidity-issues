# [\#2523 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2523) `closed`: In 0.4.12 declaring a storage pointer to a non-existent identifier throws an exception
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

When compiling something like:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.12;

contract C {
    function f() {
        uint[] x = inexistentIdentifier;
        x.push(1);
    }
}
```

In Remix the 0.4.12-release compiler version throws this exception:
```
Internal exception in StandardCompiler::compileInternal: /src/libsolidity/ast/ASTJsonConverter.cpp(791): Throw in function string dev::solidity::ASTJsonConverter::functionCallKind(dev::solidity::FunctionCallKind)
Dynamic exception type: N5boost16exception_detail10clone_implIN3dev8solidity21InternalCompilerErrorEEE
std::exception::what: std::exception
[PN3dev11tag_commentE] = Unknown kind of function call .
```

Expected behaviour would be:
`Undeclared identifier.`

If no member of `x` is used, though, the exception is not thrown.

Wonderful, we were looking for this bug! Strangely, I cannot reproduce that with latest develop.

.. but I can reproduce it on remix as you say.

Going to try locally with last develop, too.

EDIT: Just built `0.4.13-develop.2017.7.5+commit.05a26fc9.Darwin.appleclang` from source and it does error properly:
`contract.sol:10:20: Error: Undeclared identifier.`

Also on another note, `0.4.12` changelog says:
```
Inline Assembly: Warn when using `jump`s.
```

But Remix presents an error and prevents compilation of the contracts.

Should I open another issue?

This issue is fine, the component is certainly solidity. Why do you think the inline assembly change is related?

Sorry for the confusion! I meant "on a **totally unrelated** note:"! ðŸ˜„ 

That's a different issue where Remix is not treating inline assembly `jump`s as a warning but as an error which prevents compilation altogether.

Yes, this issue also has a pending fix already. We try to make a bugfix release as soon as possible.
