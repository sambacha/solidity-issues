# [\#2613 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2613) `closed`: Check for actual error message in NameAndTypeResolution tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-07-20 20:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2613):

Many of the test cases only check that there is a `DeclarationError` or a `TypeError`:
```
CHECK_ERROR(text, TypeError, "");
```

This should be changed to include the actual message expected, such as:
```
CHECK_ERROR(text, TypeError, "Interfaces cannot inherit");
```

@izgzhen thanks!

The file in question is this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp. Start anywhere you like within the file.

You can run the tests locally as described here: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contributing.html#running-the-compiler-tests

Submitting a pull request will run the tests on Travis anyway. You can also submit a work in progress pull request and keep adding more of these clarifications to it before merging.
