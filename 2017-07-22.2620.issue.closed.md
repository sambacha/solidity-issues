# [\#2620 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2620) `closed`: Option to output concatenated source code

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14032?u=ec011ca6faa1c477850f4a6c5fff995cc7ed98e2&v=4" width="50">[dbrock](https://github.com/dbrock) opened issue at [2017-07-22 14:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2620):

Can we add an option (perhaps `--src` and `--combined-json=src`) that causes the compiler to simply output the concatenated source code after resolving all `import` statements?

This is needed for e.g. Etherscan verification and is quite tedious to perform by hand if you have multiple layers of recursive dependencies.

If you just concatenate the source files, you might get a different result. Etherscan has to implement a multi-file feature if it wants to verify all contracts. As an example:

a.sol:
```
contract C {}
```
b.sol:
```
import "b.sol" as X;
contract C {}
```

If you concatenate these two files, imports will break and you will get multiple identifiers with the same name.

@chriseth so is the only option right now to either write my own script to concatenate files and/or do it manually?

@iam-peekay you might find this tool here handy: https://github.com/BlockCatIO/solidity-flattener
