# [\#2711 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2711) `closed`: msg.sender returning the wrong address in an event

I have an event that's supposed to provide the `msg.sender` value and a string. When receiving the event (using the node.js web3 module) the string comes through fine, but the address sometimes comes through as `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000020` instead of the value of `msg.sender`. 

- pragma:  `pragma solidity ^0.4.11`
- compiler: solcjs
- OS: macOS Sierra (v10.12.5)

Here's the relevant code, with `.....` replacing unnecessary info:

```
event Recorded(address person, string contact);

function recordTransaction(........, string contact){
    .............
    Recorded(msg.sender, contact);
}
```

Upon further investigation it seems the problem is with web3, not solidity so I'll move the issue over there
