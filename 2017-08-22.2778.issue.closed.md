# [\#2778 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2778) `closed`: Easy Peazy: State Mutability should be more readable in ABI

Can we make the ABI field for "statemutability" (current) to something like "state_mutability" or "state-mutability" or even some mixedCase? Makes the whole thing read easier.

I actually like it the way it is, but not too much attached to it. In order to be consistent, Iâ€™d go for `stateMutability`. Definitely against `-` and `_` looks a bit ugly to me (in JSON at least).

We should also change the AST JSON appropriately.

Fine for me!
