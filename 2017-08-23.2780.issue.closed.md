# [\#2780 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2780) `closed`: Add `pop()` method to storage array types that throws on empty arrays
**Labels**: `help wanted`

This method should be implemented analogously to `push`.

The relevant functions are `ArrayType::nativeMembers` in `Types.cpp` and `ExpressionCompiler::visit(MemberAccess const& _memberAccess)` (search for `"push"`) in ExpressionCompiler.cpp. The actual implementattion of the pop operation requires extending the `Kind`-enum in the class `FunctionType` (Types.h). Check how it is done for `ArrayPush` and just do it accordingly.

If the array is empty, the function should cause an assertion failure (`appendConditionalInvalid`).

Hey, is this still up-for-grabs (you've assigned yourself, so I'm not sure) ? If so, then I could take care of it.

@kasjan-s I'm sorry, yes this is still up for grabs! Please don't hesitate to ask any questions, either here or in https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev

Very well, I'll do it! I'll be sure to ask any questions I come up with on gitter. 

But for starters just two quick questions:
1. I assume the idea is to have pop() return the new length of the array, just like push()?
2. Part of the task is to update the documentation as well, right?

For now, I would not make pop return anything. There are some candidates but they all have their drawbacks.

There's started work in above PR, but I'm not going to have time to work on it again untill 2nd half of November. Sorry.

If anyone's interested, feel free to pick this up.

@kasjan-s do you think you can take this up again?
