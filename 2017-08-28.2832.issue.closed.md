This is due that the error is raised via `error<InvalidLiteral>();`, i.e. no text reason included. There are 9 other instances of such errors, all of them will crash.

The actual is crash is due to `what()` returning `nullptr` in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libdevcore/Exceptions.cpp#L25-L31, however according to boost that should be valid: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/exception/doc/diagnostic_information_what.html

Changing that to return a literal, `"???"` in my case, "fixes" all these crashes.

@chriseth @chfast any ideas?

Before #2567 this used `std::exception::what()` as a fallback:

Let's follow the C++ standard on this: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/exception/what
It requires the pointer to be valid.

I would call `std::exception::what()` as the fallback.
