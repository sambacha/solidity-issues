# [\#2864 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2864) `closed`: libsolc and public API

I think with the JSON I/O specification we could consider our interface quite stable and could consider making it public (it is already public as an emscripten binary) in terms of a statically linked shared library on Linux similarly to the static build based on Alpine.

For that I'd propose to:
- rename `soljson` / `jsonCompiler` to `libsolc`
- create three public methods: `solcLicense`, `solcVersion`, `solcCompile` (aka. `license`, `version`, `compileStandard` currently)
- retire the obsolete method in the future (`license`, `version`, `compileJSON`, `compileJSONMulti`, `compileJSONCallback` and `compileStandard`) 
- build `libsolc` as a statically linked shared library so that the only symbols it exposes are those three and doesn't import anything
- include `libsolc` in `make install` and the releases

@chriseth @chfast what do you think?

Doable. The only toolchain specific part is exporting symbols from a DLL. But I have it done for evmjit.so, not so big deal.

But why libsolc is needed?
And what is relation between solc and libsolc?

There is no relation between `jsonCompiler` and `solc`, though I think `libsolc` is the most fitting name (even if we don't decide on making official releases of those binaries), because is it is a "**sol**idity **c**ompiler" library.

It would be useful for binding to currently less supported platforms, such as Python, Java and even a much faster node.js integration (though one can argue a webassembly binary should be as fast).

I should make it clear that this issue has two parts:
1) cleanup of the interface (which is the used in the emscripten and hopefully later in the webassembly build)
2) deciding to make it part of the release

Are functions solcLicense, solcVersion, solcCompile `export "C"`?

Yep (they replace the current `license`, `version` and `compileStandard`)

For C-like function I would recommend using underscore naming convention: `solc_compile()`, etc.

Should it be `solc_compile`, `solc_version` and `solc_license` or rather `solidity_compile`, etc ?

I vote for `solidity_` prefix.
