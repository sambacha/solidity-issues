It would be good to enter [all the disparate info about LLL](https://gist.github.com/Souptacular/fd197b1fac7c6d2660b0bef27a33ed40#lll-and-evm-stack-resources) into one lll.readthedocs.io website which can be edited on GIthub by the community after going through the normal processing. I think it's better to have it on a separate website to https://solidity.readthedocs.io because I think it would get quite cluttered if added there, as there is a significant amount of information which could probably be expanded on.
