# [\#2886 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2886) `closed`: Overload conflict warnings should use secondary location properly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-09-12 09:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2886):

The secondary location is a vector and could store each conflicting declaration. Currently a separate  error is raised for each conflict, which could be presented more intelligently with reduced footprint.

Related #2876.
