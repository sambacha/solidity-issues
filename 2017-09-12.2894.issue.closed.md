# [\#2894 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2894) `closed`: Setting val to enum element 1 is the same as not being set

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/877417?u=23f31616386aa843f961ccd31d7bfdcf52c11914&v=4" width="50">[ramvi](https://github.com/ramvi) opened issue at [2017-09-12 13:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2894):

The first value of an enum is a 0, as expected.
All values on the blockchain are 0, if they're not set, as expected.
But with these two together create unexpected results. `validate` is only supposed to make changes to existing PartnerObj. This is checked by seeing if the status has been set to New. But as you know New = 0, and that means that non existing and New objects all go for the same. In other languages this would throw with a zeropointer. A fix is to add an unused PartnerStatus before the others. But maybe this should be implemented as default - maybe solidity enums should start on 1?

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.15;

contract PartnerRegistry {

    // Get contract address from name
    mapping(bytes12 => PartnerObj) public partnerRegistry;

    enum PartnerStatus {
        New, Validated, Deleted
    }

    struct PartnerObj {
        PartnerStatus status;
    }

    function validate(bytes12 identifier) {
        require(partnerRegistry[identifier].status == PartnerStatus.New);
        partnerRegistry[identifier].status = PartnerStatus.Validated;
    }
}
```

Objects in storage are not boxed, they are no objects with pointers to them, they are the actual objects. All values in a mapping exist at the point of creation of the contract. Objects in storage are not allocated.

In your case, the three possible values for the enum are `New`, `Validated` and `Deleted`. Which value would you expect `partnerRegistry[0]` to have at construction time? Note that this value has to be of type `PartnerStatus`.

Wouldn't that make it counter-intuitive?..

If you think of the 0th value of an `enum` as its default ("not set") value, then, from the example given, `PartnerStatus.New` matches the default value.

Saying that the default value is "unused"... Well, I find that statement questionable. In a sense, the default value _is_ the most used one. :)

BTW, if you don't want the first element of your enum to be 0, just create an value that you never use: `
enum Boolean {FileNotFound, False, True}`

Closing due to inactivity and since it is not clear whether this is a problem or not.
