Address literals have to have a valid checksum and should be exactly 20 bytes long. Anything else is an error.

Of course this should be implemented with an experimental pragma, i.e. show a warning now and and an error in 0.5.0 mode.

0x0 can still be used for resetting to default value or burn?

All zeroes must be typed for an address.

`address(0)` could still be possible.
