```
function fruit() returns (bytes32 fruitName) {
  fruitName = "apple";
}
```
This function does not result in an error or warning because an implicit return statement is added to the end of the function that returns whatever is in the `fruitName` local variable.  In a large codebase this can lead to subtle bugs due to the implicit nature of the return statement.  I would like the ability to set a compiler flag that allows me to make this a warning.  Alternatively, making it always be a compiler warning is fine by me as I think it is not a good practice to have implicit return values.

Note: I want to use the named return values because they get included in the ABI that the compiler generates which makes interacting with the contracts from external sources notably easier in some cases and it provides a certain amount of self-documentation.

Do I understand you correctly that this is about a warning if there is a code path that reaches the end of a function (which returns something) without an explicit return statement?

Perhaps we could have something like
```
function fruit() returns implicitly (bytes32 fruitName) {
  fruitName = "apple";
}
```

Instead of adding `implicitly` to the language, why not deprecate implicit returns?

@redsquirrel hm, perhaps I'm the only one who really likes them?

@chriseth I can't say I'm a fan of implicit returns, especially where
readability and security matter.  That said, I think it's quite possible to
offer this as a pragma and not super hard to write.  I seem to remember
playing around with the "unnamed return variable" when I was doing unused
variable warnings.

I'm okay with `returns implicitly` or a pragma.  In a perfect world, explicit would be the default and pragma/compiler options/keyword would be available if you wanted your compiler to be more lenient.  In general my philosophy is that compilers should be ultra strict by default with options to be less strict rather than the other way around.

However, I will take anything I can get, and if that means the default is current behavior and I have to add a pragma or do `returns explicitly (bytes32 fruitName)` I can accept that and be happy.

@MicahZoltu oh of course explicit returns would be the default, otherwise the keyword would be `returns explicitly`.
