# [\#2960 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2960) `closed`: Modifier can't read correct data from contract fields in some case

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11276553?u=2ecb1389963849faf4973b642025b56fd8896c57&v=4" width="50">[Format-X22](https://github.com/Format-X22) opened issue at [2017-09-25 16:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2960):

Code:

    pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

    contract A {
        address public owner;

        modifier onlyOwner() {
            require(msg.sender == owner);
            _;
        } 
    }

    contract B is A {
        address public owner;
        bool public ok;

        function B() {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function callMe() onlyOwner {
            ok = true;
        }
    }

    contract C is A {
        bool public ok;

        function C() {
            owner = msg.sender;
        }

        function callMe() onlyOwner {
            ok = true;
        } 
    }

Steps:
1 - Deploy contract B and C.
2 - Call "callMe" methods on B and C.
3 - See "ok" field.

In B field is FALSE, but owner is correct. Modifier read owner field from parent class?
This may be a vulnerability and cause loss of money in some cases like this:

    pragma solidity ^0.4.11;

    contract A {
        bool public started = true;

        modifier onlyIfStarted() {
            require(started == true);
            _;
        }
    }

    contract B is A {
        bool public started = false;
        bool public thisFail;

        function callMe() onlyIfStarted {
            thisFail = true;
        }
    }

Yes, this behaviour is due to the shadowing of state variables. We have a fix in the pipeline: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2563
