# [\#2970 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2970) `closed`: Move blockhash from block.blockhash to global level
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-09-26 20:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2970):

`block` is a global referring to the current block and its properties (`coinbase`, `timestamp`, `difficulty`, `number`, `gaslimit`).

`blockhash` doesn't fit in, unless it would be a `bytes32` referring to the hash of that given block (which is not possible).

I think it makes more sense promoting it to be a global method just as the other native features (log, ecrecover, etc) are.
