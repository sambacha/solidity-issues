# [\#2971 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2971) `closed`: Move msg.gas to global level as gasleft()
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

Similarly to #2970 I think `msg.gas` is very misleading as it seems to suggest the gaslimit for that given message, which is immutable, but rather it is a mutable gas left property.

I'd argue it makes more sense making it a global function named `gasleft()` (alternatively `gasleft` as a property similar to `<address>.balance`).
