I don't know why this functionality was removed. Diffs are much cleaner if trailing comma are allowed.

EMCA supports trailing commas: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas

Can you please expand where do you miss trailing commas?

The problem with not allowing trailing commas is you get ugly diffs like this:
```
   "dependencies": {
+    "brotli": "^1.3.2",
     "express": "^4.16.1",
     "google-protobuf": "^3.4.0",
-    "jquery": "^3.2.1"
+    "jquery": "^3.2.1",
+    "pako": "^1.0.6"
   }
```

I understand, but can you please show an example in which Solidity statement you are missing it?

I've noticed this bug in several places:

Instantiating a struct:
```
  struct BigStruct {
    string title;
    uint256 number;
    ...
    uint256 balance;
    int256 permissions;
  } //this is fine since they end with ;
...
  BigStruct memory bs = BigStruct({
    title: "whatever",
    number: ++structCount,
    ....
    balance: 0,
    permissions: 0 //wish the , could be put here so new fields can be easily added!
  });
```

Function returns:
```
function getStructWithLotsOfFields(uint256 num) returns (
  string title,
  uint256 number,
  ...
  uint256 balance,
  int256 permissions //wish i could put the , on the end so new fields can be easily added!
) {
  return (
    bigStructMap[num].title,
    ...
    bigStructMap[num].permissions //same problem here
  );
```

Might be others in similar situations, but these were some I found recently

Sorry for the delay in noticing the answer and thank you for expanding on it.

I think in general this goes against Solidity's goal of explicitness. I am sure having a trailing comma for example in a return parameters list could be interpreted by the user in multiple ways. (Does it return an extra unnamed parameter?!)

As a result I think while there might be some benefits (for example with diff), it is a really bad idea for Solidity.

I suggest to close this proposal. @chriseth @ekpyron @bit-shift @leonardoalt @christianparpart anybody for keeping this?

@axic I agree with you
