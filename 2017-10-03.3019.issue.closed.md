# [\#3019 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3019) `closed`: Variable names in event declarations should not be considered as shadowing
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-10-03 20:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3019):

It has been raised in #3018 that the crowdsale example on ethereum.org "doesnt work".

 A shorter example is:
```
contract C {
  address beneficiary;
  event GoalReached(address beneficiary);
}
```

Since there is no way to access both variables in "events", it should be safe not raising the warning.
