**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `optimizer`

A tool should be created which runs all the tests with different optimisations strategies and saves the results (creation bytecode size, deployed bytecode size, gas usage).

Based on the results the optimiser may need some tuning to work the best for the most common patterns of usage (such as tokens, etc.)

I guess this can be closed, given we are trying to move on from the legacy libevmasm optimiser, and for Yul we have the phaser (#7806).
