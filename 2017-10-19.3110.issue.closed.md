# [\#3110 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3110) `closed`: Pure instead of constant in new abstract class for an existing deployed contract

An existing contract used solidity 0.4.4 and has a constant function that qualifies as pure based on current language standards.
If I build an abstract contract that will be used to access the previously deployed contract, should I specify it as public pure or just public view?

existing one deployed in mainnet before byzantium:
pragma solidity ^0.4.4;
    function namehash(string name) public constant returns(bytes32) {
	...
    }

new abstract class to access that:
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;
    function namehash(string name) public pure returns(bytes32);

Is that correct usage? Or, should I stick to public view?

@manosamy you can change the "pureness" - it has no effect on the bytecode, but you can also keep it as `view`. Whatever you do, if you use an interface and a derived contract, their pureness has to match.

The inheritance aspect of this is handled in #3729.
