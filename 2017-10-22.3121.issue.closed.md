# [\#3121 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3121) `closed`: Another SMTChecker bug

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5925937?u=7c9d3e74b751ee94a39deb89e7b3658a10729c68&v=4" width="50">[joeykrug](https://github.com/joeykrug) opened issue at [2017-10-22 23:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3121):

```
solc Controller.sol
Internal compiler error during compilation:
```

That's all it says, I get it when running it on Controller.sol here https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/tree/develop/source/contracts

When removing the smt checker pragma it compiles fine :/

Sidenote: the Augur contracts are probably a good benchmark for running the SMTChecker / new solidity compiler versions against as they're complex and use a lot of varied functionality

@joeykrug can you run it #2993 applied?

Just tried it, still gives the same issue

Can you copy in the entire error message? (It should have text after "Internal compiler error")

Unfortunately it doesnâ€™t have any text after that, which is frustrating

Slightly unrelated: @joeykrug is there an "easy" way to run the augur smart contract tests? We are running some external project's tests against each pull request and as you say, your contract would be another good candidate, I guess. Running them against the SMT checker is probably a little too early, though.

@joeykrug are you using a native `solc` binary? There must be text after it.

@axic, I compiled it locally, yeah. There's no text. There's also no text when I use the apt-get install solc binary version either.

@chriseth Sure, 

```
git clone https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core.git
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd tests
pytest -vv
```

will run the tests on all the contracts.

This won't be very helpful for testing:

```
IController.sol:1:1: Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.4.19-develop.2017.10.23+commit.a4fa4e07.mod.Darwin.appleclang - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
pragma solidity 0.4.17;
^---------------------^
```

How do you actually run your SMT tests?

Oh, on my local version I found / replaced `pragma solidity 0.4.17;` with `pragma solidity ^0.4.17;`

And which file(s) do you add the smtchecker pragma?

Adding the pragma only to Controller results in:

```
$ solc Controller.sol

I think the problem above is already fixed in the upcoming pull request.

It doesn't according to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3121#issuecomment-338521285 - also tried it myself now:

Ah ok, sorry then. Will take a look after devcon.

Controller, IController, IControlled

Seems to be worked with 0.4.19.
