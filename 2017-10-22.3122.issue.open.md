# [\#3122 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3122) `open`: Allow using pure functions in assignment to constant variables
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

```
E               /home/ubuntu/workspace/tests/solidity_test_helpers/Constants.sol:34:45: TypeError: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
E                   uint256 public constant GAS_TO_REPORT = Reporting.gasToReport();
```

I have a contract I'm trying to compile that imports another contract with a pure / constant function as below: 

```
    uint256 private constant GAS_TO_REPORT = 600000;

    function gasToReport() internal pure returns (uint256) { return GAS_TO_REPORT; }

```

Any idea why it's saying `Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.` for this line: `uint256 public constant GAS_TO_REPORT = Reporting.gasToReport();` ?

Only a limited set of expressions are accepted as "pure" for compile-time constants and currently `pure` functions are not part of that.

Though it may be feasible lifting that restriction since we have a visibility checker in place now, though I would rather opt to restrict it even further (sha256/ripemd160 is part of it, yet it will compiled into a `call` and that is counterintuitive).

I'd argue against allowing any `pure` function in `constant` variables before #3157 is sorted out.
