> Remarks for implementation: As the code is now (August 2015), this can neither be implemented in ControlFlowGraph (because it cannot modify items) nor in CommonSubexpressionEliminator (because it cannot look ahead), so we have to use a new stage. It should not be implemented by a sliding window optimizer because then we cannot detect cases where the tag is DUPed from somewhere else.

I'm pretty sure this is implemented in the peephole optimizer.

This is implemented https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/PeepholeOptimiser.cpp#L157-L181
