brew linkapps solidity
Warning: `brew linkapps` has been deprecated and will eventually be removed!

Unfortunately `brew linkapps` cannot behave nicely with e.g. Spotlight using
either aliases or symlinks and Homebrew formulae do not build "proper" `.app`
bundles that can be relocated. Instead, please consider using `brew cask` and
migrate formulae using `.app`s to casks.

@quantumproducer do you have any luck on this? I'm also experiencing the same problem

Same problem:

Warning: Calling 'brew linkapps' is deprecated!
There is no replacement.
/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/cmd/linkapps.rb:18:in `linkapps'

I don't think actually `linkapps` makes sense for solidity. Why would anyone need `/Applications/solidity.app`? It cannot be meaningfully run anywhere else but on the command line.

I think this might have been a remnant of solidity sharing a repository with AlethZero, AlethOne and AlethFive ;-)
