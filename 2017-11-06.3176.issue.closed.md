# [\#3176 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3176) `closed`: ABI v2 is incorrectly identifying a structure as recursive.
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/975687?v=4" width="50">[ricmoo](https://github.com/ricmoo) opened issue at [2017-11-06 21:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3176):

See the [Solidity source here](https://gist.github.com/ricmoo/f62c6c197f2587857055217c6e02eb3d).

It is affecting a large (ish) number of my procedurally generated test cases for the [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) ABI coder with v2 support. For now these test cases are being dropped from the suite.

Let me know if you need other example test cases; this one is one of the less noisy test cases, as the procedural generation often creates rather bizarre contracts.

**Compiler Version (soljson):** 0.4.18+commit.9cf6e910

-- 

```
contract Test {
    struct Struct88E6516D13 {
        int[] a;
    }

    struct StructB788F2F62D {
        string[3] a;
        int208[] b;
    }

    function test() constant returns (Struct88E6516D13 r0, StructB788F2F62D r1) {
    }
}
```
