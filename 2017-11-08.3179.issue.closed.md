# [\#3179 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3179) `closed`: Memory not cleared (?) before call and result after fallback function is treated as boolean

Found by @D-Nice, I think there is another issue this is a duplicate of, but couldn't find it:

```
contract C {
    function g() returns (bool);
}

contract D {
    function() {}

    function f() returns (bool) {
        // call `g()` on `D` (non existing method), but returns `true`
        // due to the memory not cleared after the fallback function 
        return C(this).g();
    }
}
```

Invalid casts always cause undefined behaviour. We can probably partly fix this with returndatacopy, but the issue will always persist.

One way to make this more deterministic currently is to clear the return memory space before the call, though with `returndatasize` it is arguably simpler.

This has been fixed.
