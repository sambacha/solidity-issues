# [\#3244 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3244) `closed`: Remove solc warning detection from zeppelin tests
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `build system :building_construction:`

Currently our tests are always failing:

```
> zeppelin-solidity@1.3.0 test /tmp/tmp.Cblq5apBSn
> scripts/test.sh
Starting our own testrpc instance
Error parsing /tmp/tmp.Cblq5apBSn/contracts/Bounty.sol: Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
Compilation failed. See above.
```

@frangio would it be possible to have a flag for disabling this check?

Can we somehow patch it out from the testing framework?

@axic I don't understand what the problem is. What check would we have to disable?

It seems that zeppelin tests are failing because the above `Warning: This is a pre-release compiler...` is treated as an error. Maybe it is enforced by truffle?

Context: during the Solidity build the `soljson.js` is replaced with a fresh build, which is a prerelease version.

@spalladino that should work. You can try running the exact same tests with `test/externalTests.sh <absolute path to soljson.js>`

Did it locally and it triggered the problem:
```
$ wget https://ethereum.github.io/solc-bin/bin/soljson-v0.4.19-nightly.2017.11.22+commit.f22ac8fc.js
$ ./externalTests.sh `pwd`/soljson-v0.4.19-nightly.2017.11.22+commit.f22ac8fc.js
```

It seems that truffle emits this when using truffle-compile `parse` or `parseImports` https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-compile/blob/develop/parser.js#L44

Thanks @axic, I did manage to reproduce it using that compiler. Issue was I was overwriting the file in `node_modules/solc`, but not in `node_modules/truffle/node_modules/solc`.

I'll take a look there. Last thing I had managed to check was that truffle emits warns as errors only if the strict flag is set, which is disabled by default. Thanks!

@spalladino never mind. It seems this is entirely an issue in Truffle. They use the above methods as part of the which-file-has-changed mechanism for keeping a compilation cache.

Got it. Keep us posted on whether we should change anything on our end!
