edit: Forgive me for confusion, I'm literally just learning Solidity while writing a parser.

The following should be equivalent according to grammar.txt:

```
function bar() only_owner public; // this compiles
function bar() public only_owner; // this does not compile
```

Either a function with a modifier must have a block following it and the first case is a bug, or it doesn't and the second case is a bug. Can't tell which atm.

~Actually, it seems to be an issue with solc, will open a new issue (unless I find one)...~

Updated original issue.

I think that should compile, but seemingly fails.

When I made this comment I didn't observe properly that the functions are not implemented.

I don't think it should compile if the function is not implemented. What is the point of the modifier in that case?
