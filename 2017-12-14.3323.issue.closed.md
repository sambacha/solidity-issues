# [\#3323 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3323) `closed`: SOL-004 RAM Blow-up by exponential steps in constant cycle findings
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

**Description**

This issue originates in the same code as the previous one. In this case, we force the compiler to performs an exponential number of steps to find a cycle in constants definitions.
We’ve attached the file Exploit4.sol as an working example. In the example there are only 160 constant definitions. There are two constant chains, A and B, each constant in the chain is numbered. Each constants refers to two other constants, one for the chain A and another from the chain B, forming a DAG. The compiler will try to explore every possible path from the first contant to the last, which results in 280 steps. The solidity source code is tiny, only 4 Kbytes.

The file structure is the following:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract XX {
int constant v0a=v1a+v1b;int constant v0b=v1a+v1b;
int constant v1a=v2a+v2b;int constant v1b=v2a+v2b;
int constant v2a=v3a+v3b;int constant v2b=v3a+v3b;
int constant v3a=v4a+v4b;int constant v3b=v4a+v4b;
int constant v4a=v5a+v5b;int constant v4b=v5a+v5b;
int constant v5a=v6a+v6b;int constant v5b=v6a+v6b;
….. continued….
int constant v76a=v77a+v77b;int constant v76b=v77a+v77b;
int constant v77a=v78a+v78b;int constant v77b=v78a+v78b;
int constant v78a=v79a+v79b;int constant v78b=v79a+v79b;
int constant v79a=v80a+v80b;int constant v79b=v80a+v80b;
int constant v80a=0;
int constant v80b=0;
}
```

**Recommendations**

Rewrite cycle-finding algorithm to avoid exponential blow-up or set a limit in the depth of
constants references.

@SergioDemianLerner can you also paste in here a proper example triggering it?
