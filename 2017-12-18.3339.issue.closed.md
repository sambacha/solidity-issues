# [\#3339 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3339) `closed`: doc: the documentation is wrong about what state variables are
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

`structure-of-a-contract.rst` says
```
State variables are values which are permanently stored in contract storage.
```
but variables are not values.

Variables have names and scopes while values don't.  Values can be passed to other contracts as arguments while variables cannot be (only the values contained in the variables are passed to other contracts).
