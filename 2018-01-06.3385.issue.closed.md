# [\#3385 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3385) `closed`: TypeError: Tuple component cannot be empty.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2800641?u=09980da83910fdf72e2cc455cee6aa97c976b64d&v=4" width="50">[JohnAllen](https://github.com/JohnAllen) opened issue at [2018-01-06 05:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3385):

When there's an extra comma in a return value tuple, this error throws.  It was not immediately apparent what the problem was based on the error.  The compiler error message points to the opening parens of the tuple and not the extra comma as well.

Should this error be more specific and/or add this possible case of there being an extra error?  Will submit a PR for this if so desired.

Do you mean this?

```
contract C {
  function f() returns (uint,uint) {
    return (1,);
  }
}
```

```
return.sol:3:5: Error: Different number of arguments in return statement than in returns declaration.
    return (1,);
    ^---------^

close but actually points to the opening parentheses, like this and doesn't include the extra comma or contents of the return values at all.
```
return (
       ^
```

I would say the behavior for when this happens in the parameter list is helpful and probably what could happen for `return tuple` as well <img width="1894" alt="screen shot 2018-01-07 at 7 11 28 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2800641/34650697-208055da-f37a-11e7-89f9-cfd2182afc2a.png">

Ah okay, the problem you have is that if it spans multiple lines, only the first one is shown.

Current behaviour:
```
contract C {
  function f() returns (uint,uint) {
    return (
      1,
    );
  }
}
```

will have an error message of:
```
3385.sol:3:12: Error: Tuple component cannot be empty.
    return (
           ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

I think this is solved by that extra message added in #3640.

Late to the party but got the same misleasing error:
```
TypeError: Tuple component cannot be empty.
   --> src/Bounty.sol:208:16:
    |
208 |         return (
    |                ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```
I think the error should be `trailing comma on tuple`

@Kayaba-Attribution This does not have to be a trailing comma. You'll get the same error for example in a situation like this:
```solidity
return (1, 2, , 3, 4);
```
It's really exactly what it says - a tuple component cannot be left empty in certain situations.
