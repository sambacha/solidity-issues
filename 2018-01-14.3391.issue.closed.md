# [\#3391 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3391) `closed`: Should abbreviations be capitalized in mixedCase?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=cc7b2e76c56456ff05e23fa5ca044e4a461b2eb1&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) opened issue at [2018-01-14 18:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3391):

From: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/style-guide.rst.

Two (among many) capitalization techniques are defined:

* `CapitalizedWords` (or CapWords)
* `mixedCase` (differs from `CapitalizedWords` by initial lowercase character!)

And shortly following is the note:

> When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.

Please strengthen this note to one of either:

1. > When using abbreviations in CapWords (or mixedCase), capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.

2. > When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError. This does not apply to `mixedCase`.

3. > When using abbreviations in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the abbreviation. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError. This applies to `mixedCase` too, with the exception of that the first word/abbreviation must still be lowercase.

Do you think choice 1 is better?
