While going through *solidity* [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) I came across a term 'the owning contract' which i didnt understand.

> A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain. The line uint storedData; declares a state variable called storedData of type uint (unsigned integer of 256 bits). You can think of it as a single slot in a database that can be queried and altered by calling functions of the code that manages the database. In the case of Ethereum, this is always **the owning contract**. And in this case, the functions set and get can be used to modify or retrieve the value of the variable.

@axic in docs this seems to be very clearly understandable. Should we close it?

I think 'owning' is still the wrong term here.

can we put the word "changeable" or "dynamic" in place to owning?

if "owning" means the contract that contains the specified code then it seems fine to me.
