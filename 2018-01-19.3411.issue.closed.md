# [\#3411 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411) `closed`: Allow public constants in interfaces
**Labels**: `feature`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=cc7b2e76c56456ff05e23fa5ca044e4a461b2eb1&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) opened issue at [2018-01-19 23:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411):

(Previously, this issue discussed ALL constants, now it only addresses public constants.)

Currently constants are not allowed in interfaces:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

interface Nameable {
    string public constant name;
}
```

Error is:

> TypeError: Variables cannot be declared in interfaces.
>
>    string public constant name;
>    ^-------------------------^

Public constants affect ABI and should be allowed in interfaces.

---

If this issue is implemented and also if interfaces gain the ability to bring default implementations, then this syntax will be even more useful:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

interface ERC165 {
    // Interface signature for ERC-165
    bytes4 constant INTERFACE_SIGNATURE_ERC165 = // 0x01ffc9a7
        bytes4(keccak256('supportsInterface(bytes4)'));

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) constant returns (bool);
}
```

This is a tricky one. Interfaces only allow declarations which are reflected in the external ABI and a constant isn't such a thing.

I think at this point this may cause more problems as it solves given the current messy handling of `public` modifiers on variable and inheritance.

@axic Thank you, I have studied more how interfaces are implemented. For now I have reduced the scope of this issue to only address public constants without implementations (i.e. values).

Can you actually revert the change and post this new version as a comment? My comment makes little to no sense now.

Sorry, I lost history, I thought GitHub saved it. For clarity, I did at a note to the top.

Having thought a bit more about this, I do not think constants belong to interfaces. Are you sure you do not need `enum`s instead?

This issue only makes sense if interfaces are being removed/changed wholesale -- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3420 I'll let that discussion continue in #3420

----

If interfaces are truly just to track ABI of a contract on EVM (again, I hate the ABI word choice) then I agree and only `function` wording is needed, the `constant` is just an implementation detail of a `function`.

----

So either way, yes I agree this should be closed.

> ABI (again, I hate this word choice)

You are using this in all issues. How would you call it if not the ABI?

The "JSON ABI" part can be misleading, there might be a better name for "the JSON description file of the particular entry points in a contract".

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=cc7b2e76c56456ff05e23fa5ca044e4a461b2eb1&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) commented at [2018-01-19 23:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411#issuecomment-361460112):

The application binary interface is anything that touches EVM -- the function signature hash, function call data types, function return data types. Everything else is not ABI.

The JSON file includes implementation-specific details:

 * An unverifiable guarantee of function names (helpful)
 * An unverifiable guarantee of parameter names (helpful)
 * An unverifiable guarantee of enum names (helpful, but dangerous)
 * An unverifiable guarantee of event topic names (helpful)
 * An unverifiable guarantee of whether `require(msg.value==0)` boilerplate is at the top of the function
 * A recommendation of whether STATICCALL should always be used instead of CALL
 * Maybe something similar for PURECALL in the future

Maybe that's a "contract description file" or something else. But I need to keep reminding myself that it is NOT an ABI.

Thanks for listening.

Since we allow accessing constants through contract names (#1290) and enums in interfaces (#4087), it may make sense to reconsider this feature, at least for some healthy discussion.

I am still not sure if it is a good idea or not (it definitely can be useful from a users' perspective, but could be dangerous?)

The case I ran into is the following (https://github.com/ralexstokes/deposit-contract-verifying-proxy/pull/2):
```
interface DepositContract {
    uint constant PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH = 48;
    uint constant SIGNATURE_LENGTH = 96;

    function deposit(
        bytes calldata publicKey,
        bytes32 withdrawalCredentials,
        bytes calldata signature,
        bytes32 depositDataRoot
    ) external payable;
}
```

In this example the interface uses basic types (`bytes`), but they have a limit enforced (the two constant above) so it would be useful from the caller to have `require` statements:
```
contract DepositProxy {
    function verifyAndDeposit(...) public {
        require(publicKey.length == DepositContract.PUBLIC_KEY_LENGTH, "incorrectly sized public key");
        require(signature.length == DepositContract.SIGNATURE_LENGTH, "incorrectly sized signature");

        // ...

        DepositContract(0x...).deposit(...);
    }
}
```

Oops, I think the original issue was about allowing "getter" functions to be defined. This has been solved  by #3514.

My proposal was unrelated, hence moved to #8775.
