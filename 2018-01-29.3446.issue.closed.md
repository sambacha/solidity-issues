# [\#3446 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3446) `closed`: Copying of type struct memory[] memory to storage not yet supported

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11001914?u=c1717ea36c0da639ac9a532ab3cd901947239e8c&v=4" width="50">[EasonWang01](https://github.com/EasonWang01) opened issue at [2018-01-29 09:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3446):

If we have the following:
```go
    Student[] public students;
    
    struct Student {
        string name;
        uint weight;
        uint height;
        uint age;
    }

    function remove_student(uint id) public onlyTeacher returns (Student[] ) {
        Student[] memory _students = students;
        while (id < _students.length-1) {
            _students[id] = _students[id + 1];
            id++;
        }
        students.length--;
        students = _students;
    }

```
It will got some error

`Copying of type struct memory[] memory to storage not yet supported`

When will this being support in the future in order for saving gas for array manipulate.

Without this function, arrays of structures can hardly be used.

Note that an extremely high amount of gas is hidden behind this simple assignment. We recommend using a loop to perform the assignment anyway. An even more efficient way to write the function above is to not use a memory array at all and directly work on storage.

@chriseth 
I mean, when will the storage  return be formally supported?
The present structure can only record state, and it is of little use in function.

@hunjixin you can copy employing a loop. We are actually considering removing copy operations that require unbounded costs alltogether from the language.

Closing since it seems answered. Please feel free to reopen with more questions.

Would be nice to get a line number from this error.

Some extra info for anyone annoyed by this not being allowed: we do plan to make expensive copy operations like this possible and easy but we want the user to be aware the this is not something to be done lightly. The `copyof` operator (#2435) would be a solution for this.
