# [\#3460 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3460) `closed`: Usage of default stack-sizes may cause undefined behaviour

I just started to play around with the `solidity` sources @ c696803f0b61c7a77e3b438c256791b22add9d7a. After running the test-suite, I noticed that the used stack is not large enough to run the JuliaParser/recursion_depth test.

```
➜  solidity ./build/test/soltest -- --no-ipc
Running 1056 test cases...
unknown location:0: fatal error: in "JuliaParser/recursion_depth": memory access violation at address: 0x7ffee8b04310: invalid permissions
/tmp/solidity/test/libjulia/Parser.cpp:240: last checkpoint: "recursion_depth" test entry

*** 1 failure is detected in the test module "SolidityTests"
```
I use OS X (10.13.3) with clang (Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.39.2)).

However, I was able to find out that this problem is not clang specific, it is specific to the default stack-size of OS X, that seem to be 8MB. The JuliaParser/recursion_depth test will fail, if only 8MB of stack is available.

I would recommend to change the linker flags in `cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake` to ensure that the default-stack size is never used - it may differ on some systems. It is very important to have consistent execution environments. 

```
…
if ("${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID}" MATCHES "Clang")
…
  # The default stack-sizes may be different. We set the stack size to be 16MB manually.
  set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS} -Wl,-stack_size -Wl,0x1000000")
```
`CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS` should  define the stack-size of 16MB for all supported toolchains.

As `cpp-ethereum` seem to use a very similar version of `cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake`, it may make sense to change the linker flags there too.

Another very simple solution would be to limit `m_recursionDepth` to `2204` - in this case the  `JuliaParser/recursion_depth` test-case can be executed with an 8MB stack.

See `libsolidity/parsing/ParserBase.cpp:104` in function `ParserBase::increaseRecursionDepth()`.

```cpp
void ParserBase::increaseRecursionDepth()
{
	m_recursionDepth++;
	if (m_recursionDepth >= 2205)
		fatalParserError("Maximum recursion depth reached during parsing.");
}
```

@chriseth @axic From my point of view this issue can be closed.
