What you cite is just the location of the error, not the actual message. The screenshot link does not work for me. Do you have the full compiler error message?

Assuming it is just a "Spanning multiple lines" message confusing @freshonline, which is tracked in #3620.

Please reopen with a proper log if it is a different issue.
