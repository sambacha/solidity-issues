Not sure what could be a good notation and/or a generic way for this. As a workaround a function type can be defined.

Split off #3544.

@chriseth, sure:
```
this.transfer(address,uint256).selector
this.transfer(address,uint256,bytes).selector
this.balanceOf.selector
address.transfer(uint256).selector
```

Isn't this issue very similar to #526? Maybe whatever solution will be found can be used for both

Yep, sounds similar!

The workaround:
```solidity
contract Selector {
    function transfer(address, uint) external {}
    function transfer(address) external {}
    function calculateSelector() public pure returns (bytes4) {
        function (address) external t;
        return t.selector;
    }
}
```

But assigning the correct function to the `t` is not possible (due to overloading resolution lacking), hence type checking can't be enforced here. So not sure if this workaround is better than just doing keccak manually.

Should we remove the `bug` label from this one? To me it looks more like a missing feature. I.e. there's nothing broken, just the right syntax is missing.

However, calling `calculateSelector()` returns `0x00000000`.

IIUC it's not really a working workaround. The idea was that ``function (address) external t = this.transfer; return t.selector;`` *could* be a workaround, *if* it worked (but it doesn't)...
I'm not sure there's a really *good* workaround at this point. What you can always do, though, is to define an abstract auxiliary contract in which the function is not overloaded (or calculate the hash manually with ``keccak256``), e.g.
```
abstract contract Selector2 {
    function transfer(address, uint) external virtual;
}
contract Selector {
    function transfer(address, uint) external {}
    function transfer(address) external {}
    function calculateSelector() public pure returns (bytes4) {
        return Selector2.transfer.selector;
    }
}
```

But we should probably try to solve this issue properly.

Existing syntax create ambiguity, which could be a source of potential errors. Providing arguments looks as remedy for such errors, as it was mentioned above:

```
this.transfer(address,uint256).selector
this.transfer(address,uint256,bytes).selector
```

@MikaelLazarev moreover we already have similar syntax for abi.decode:
```solidity
abi.decode(data, (address,uint256,bytes))
```

> so what about the proposed synthax? [#3556 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3556#issuecomment-460272880)

@chriseth is off now so we won't get an answer from him until February but for me this syntax looks ambiguous.

In the code below, would `this.g(Enum)` be a function call or a reference to a specific overload of the function?
```solidity
contract C {
    enum Enum { A, B, C }

    function g(Enum e) public {}
    function g(uint i) public {}

    function f() public {
        uint Enum = 42;
        this.g(Enum).selector; // ambiguous
    }
}
```

I think we we need different syntax for this. Here are some ideas:

1. If you want to follow `abi.decode()`, then it could be something like this, without introducing anything new:
    ```solidity
    abi.resolve(this.transfer, (address, uint256, bytes))(0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```
    `abi.resolve()` suggests that it would work only for external functions so we may need a better name for such a builtin.
2. Or we could just add something to distinguish it from a call. Best if it's not an existing operator so it cannot be interpreted as an expression:
    ```solidity
    this.transfer@(address, uint256, bytes)(0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```
    or
    ```solidity
    this.transfer::(address, uint256, bytes)(0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```
    or
    ```solidity
    (this.transfer as (address, uint256, bytes))(0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```
3. We could also try to make it look like a cast. Current cast syntax won't work but with #11284 it could look like this:
    ```solidity
    resolve<address, uint256, bytes>(this.transfer)(0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```
    or
    ```solidity
    cast<function(address, uint256, bytes) external>(this.transfer)(0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```
4. Another idea would be to reuse array brackets. It's not ambiguous in terms of syntax but might be confusing to people not used to it:
    ```solidity
    this.transfer[address, uint256, bytes](0x123, 0, "abc");
    ```

@cameel why it should look ambiguous if the param list contains types instead of expressions/values?

Type names are not necessarily reserved keywords. They can be just normal identifiers. Well, technically the ambiguity can be resolved but either way of doing it prevents you from doing something: in my example if you treat the type name as shadowed by a variable, it prevents you from being able to get a pointer to `g(Enum)`. If you ignore shadowing and always treat it as a type, you cannot call `g(Enum)`.

Also, it's IMO not great for humans either. With contract, struct, enum names, etc. it might not be clear at all that what you're looking at is a function pointer and not a function call. I'd rather have clearer syntax for that.

Unless you mean that appending `.selector` at the end makes it unambiguous that you're not referring to a call. But I think such context-dependent constructs unnecessarily complicate the language. It would require special-casing the parsing just for this and people would also need to know that it's a weird exception that breaks the general pattern. Adding new syntax for this seems much simpler to me.

@cameel Does the same problem with type names and variable names exist with abi.decode method, when you will provide Enum as parameter in types list: `abi.decode(this.transfer, (Enum))`? It looks like a little bit artificial, and as developer you can simply eliminate it by naming things properly.

Adding `abi.resolve` function also makes things more complex, cause selector is bytes4 constant, when abi.encode / abi.decode are functions which will be compiled into bytecode.

Just to try to elaborate on the concern about the syntax in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3556#issuecomment-460272880:
Technically, in solidity types are regular expressions of type "type type" :-). That's e.g. how ``abi.decode(..., <tuple of types>)`` works - that's not custom magic syntax for ``abi.decode``, but the tuple of types is a valid expression everywhere. You can also validly do e.g. ``(int, uint);`` as a statement in solidity :-).
That's mostly a technical detail at this point, since "type types" cannot be named in solidity. But having types as expressions may (or may not) be useful for generics/templates, depending how we'll end up doing them... so it's unclear if and how this will evolve in the future and it's better to keep our options open.

My preferred solution to the issue at hand at the moment would be to treat it as a plain regular cast - as @cameel noted that doesn't work right now, because functions cannot be casted using the current conversion syntax, but it's on our agenda to rework that anyways, so hopefully this will yield a nice solution killing two birds with one stone...

@MikaelLazarev You're right. `abi.decode(this.transfer, (Enum))` has the same problem with shadowing and won't compile either if you define a variable called `Enum` so my argument was a bit weak.

Still, I really don't like how much of a special case that syntax would be. Like @ekpyron said, there's no magic with current `abi.decode()`. Parameter is just a tuple and cannot be interpreted differently. With `this.transfer(address,uint256,bytes).selector` the meaning of the parenthesis changes based on context.

> Adding `abi.resolve` function also makes things more complex, cause selector is bytes4 constant

True, it would be a bit different than the other `abi.` functions. To be honest this is not my preferred syntax. I was just trying to give you a few varied possibilities to choose from. Personally, I'd rather have it as a cast. Alternatively, `this.transfer@(address, uint256, bytes)` would be my second choice.

Since #11284 would give us an easy way out of this, posting feedback there is likely this speed up getting to a solution here too. We need opinions on the proposed syntax (or new proposals).

Right now function pointers have argument types defined in compile-time and selector defined in run-time:
```
function(address, uint256, bytes) external func;
```

Let's add the ability to have `selector` fixed in the compile too:
```
function transfer(address, uint256, bytes) external func;
```

Then `this.transfer` will be a function pointer with a fixed selector and for overloaded methods will create ambiguity during compilation and ask the developer to resolve this method with some of the syntax construction discussed earlier for example:
```
this.transfer[address,uint256]
```

While I also like the conversion syntax, it is a bit weird at type level, since you apply a function (the conversion function) to an object that does not have a fixed value. I think we have to go with some special syntax like `name::<types>`, although over the years I have come to see overloading more and more messy and would like to avoid it.

I'm not sure whether I understood @k06a 's proposal correctly, but a function pointer with a fixed selector is essentially an interface with a single defined function. Is this a possible way out here?

@chriseth yes, but the interface is static at compile-time and a function pointer is dynamic.

We need a syntax to resolve overloads in a generic way, not a syntax specific to the selector function.
