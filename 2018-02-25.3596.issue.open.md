# [\#3596 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3596) `open`: Improve standard JSON output for "contract methods"
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `protocol design :crystal_ball:`

Currently there are two outputs listing contract methods:
```
          // The list of function hashes
          methodIdentifiers: {
            "delegate(address)": "5c19a95c"
          },
          // Function gas estimates
          gasEstimates: {
            creation: {
              codeDepositCost: "420000",
              executionCost: "infinite",
              totalCost: "infinite"
            },
            external: {
              "delegate(address)": "25000"
            },
            internal: {
              "heavyLifting()": "infinite"
            }
          }
```

It would be nice to have a single object with more information, which could also handle unimplemented functions (see #3594).

Option 1:
```
methods: {
  // parentheses since that is invalid as a function name
  "creation": {
  },
  "fallback": {
  },
  "external": {
    "delegate(address)": {
      selector: "5c19a95c",
      gas: "25000"
    }
  },
  unimplemented: [
    "unimplementedFunction"
  ],
  internal: {
    "heavyLifting()": {
      gas: "infinite"
    }
  }
}
```

Option 2:
```
methods: {
  // parentheses since that is invalid as a function name
  // creation or constructor
  "(creation)": {
  },
  "(fallback)": {
  },
  "delegate(address)": {
    selector: "5c19a95c",
    visibility: "external",
    gas: "25000"
  },
  "unimplementedFunction":  {
    selector: "44228182",
    type: "unimplemented"
  },
  "heavyLifting()": {
    visibility: "internal",
    gas: "infinite"
  }
}
```

After #3198 there will be a need to distinguish between "receive ether" and "wildcard".

@chriseth I think we should do this improvement step, could be done fairly quickly after we agree on the new format.

The problem is that we actually cannot really identify internal functions by their name. Should we rather use the AST id?
