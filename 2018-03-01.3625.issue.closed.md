libz3 version 4.6.0 causes the test SMTChecker/division to hang indefinitely.

@leonardoalt would you like to take a short look into this? The problematic test seems to be the signed division overflow test.

Sure. I got the SMT formula (below) and tried on different versions of z3.
Version 4.5.0 solves it correctly (SAT) in 0.2s, whereas version 4.6.0 indeed hangs.
I'll open an issue and see what they say.

Wonderful, thanks! How did you extract the formula? We tried this morning but could not make it hang.

In `Z3Interface::check`, just `cout << m_solver << endl;`. Then I added `(check-sat)`.

*doh* I thought I remembered there was some kind of easy solution ;)

Hehe I've been using that to debug the encoding since I started contributing, perhaps I should have shared it somehow...

The issue in the z3prover repository: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/1511

So, the current status is the following.
It was suggested that we use a `z3` option called `rewriter.pull_cheap_ite`.
When using this option to solve the formula as a standalone `smtlib2` file, `z3-4.6.0` is as fast as `z3-4.5.0` (~0.2s). This is done by adding `(set-option :rewriter.pull_cheap_ite true)` as the first line in the above formula.
BUT... when I added this option in the C++ API, the time improvement wasn't the same, as `Solidity+z3-4.6.0` takes almost 12s to compile the test (at least it doesn't hang forever), and `Solidity+z3-4.5.0` takes ~0.26s.
I'm still investigating...

This option is disabled when using incremental mode (which we do). The Z3 devs are looking into possible solutions.

The solution involves using the performance option mentioned before (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3642) plus code changes in `z3` which are now in `z3`'s `master` branch. Unfortunately I guess this means we can't use version 4.6.0.

Is it solved? Don't we have to wait for the 4.6 fix release?

The fix is in `z3`'s `master` branch.

What do you think about adding a (generous) timeout for SMT solvers in general? In my experience SMT solvers can easily (virtually or actually) take forever and I think a solver error reporting a timeout might be much more helpful than checks that (seemingly or actually) run forever in such cases...

Yes, at some point we have to do that. Currently, the solver still takes virtually no time at all, but I fear that this might change :)

I also think it's a good idea. Ideally I think the user would also be able to override it.

Btw, what's required to close this issue?

I can confirm at least that it doesn't hang with ``z3``'s ``master`` branch anymore, but it might make sense to keep this issue open at least until 4.6.1 is released? Otherwise users which use the current stable z3 version, i.e. 4.6.0, might reopen this issue or similar issues anyways - as long as it is open they might instead find this one.

That's true. The thing is, z3 doesn't seem to release a lot of versions. They asked in the issue there if we needed a tagged release, and I said no. I guess I can ask again :p

Timeout has been added in #4593.
