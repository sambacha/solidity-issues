# [\#3667 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3667) `closed`: Ensure that missed enum values are tested for in Types

For example `dev::solidity::FunctionType::richIdentifier()` has a switch with a default doing an assertion. 

Two options came up (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3660#issuecomment-370744653):
a) add unit tests for each of the enums
b) remove the default case and force compile time errors

b) would be easier to do, just need to be careful that the right compiler flags are used.

@axic , I would like to look at this issue. Option b says just remove default option which raises `solAssert`. Could you please share more details like:
1) How to reproduce this issue
2) Tests to be performed
3) Any other changes to consider

Also what is really meant by "**careful that the right compiler flags are used**"

From the original issue:

> adding such a test does not help in this case. If you miss it, you miss it. We should change all switch statements to not include a default case (where feasible) to get a warning at compile time.

Basically this proposes that `switch` statements handling call kind should not have a default case, but let the compiler catch unhandled cases with the `-Wswitch-enum` flag.

I guess adding a `static_assert` could also be an option? @chfast what do you think, would a compiler optimise out such a default case if all the cases are handled explicitly in the switch?

I'm not sure what you want to `static_assert`.

But compilers warn about this starting from GCC 4.x when using `-Wall`, the specialized flag is `-Wswitch`:
https://godbolt.org/g/oMQ5Nt

I suggest to remove the default case to detect the problem at compile-time instead of run-time. I hope you don't cast integers to enums.

@axic @chfast , what tests you would suggest to verify the fix. Fix as I understand is just to remove the default case.

Remove the default case. Then remove any other case and see if the compiler (ideally the one used in CI) warns about it. If yes, you are good.

@chriseth @chfast , I see default has 16 occurrences in Types.cpp. Please confirm if we need to remove all of them.

I think there are some more cases that can be handled, for example at the end of `ExpressionCompiler::visit(FunctionCall...)`
