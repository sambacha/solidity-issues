# [\#3687 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3687) `closed`: Computing gas stipend for calls to precompiles could use an underflow guard (post-Byzantium)
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Has been [brought up on /r/ethdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/82p78k/two_identical_arguments_for_function_call_one/); most relevant to `solc` is likely [this sub-thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethdev/comments/82p78k/two_identical_arguments_for_function_call_one/dvc8bbh/).

In short: when preparing for a `CALL` to a precompile (`ecrecover` in this case), the compiler generates code that allocates a gas stipend of `post_compile_const - GAS`, and then doesn't check if the result wrapped around 0 by chance (i.e. `post_compile_const < GAS`).

@chriseth [says](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5aa056417685a046389c5f8b) that pre-Byzantium, this would fail.

/u/Figs999 links the [code block](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/14b12ae7452388516d0c4eb833b0c83fe5156b44/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1769) where the computation is done.

X_X

Closing as duplicate.

Actually this one has much more details :)

It turns out that this is already correct for byzantium VMs. So if you compile for pre-Tangerine Whistle and run it on pre-Tangerine Whistle, it works fine, if you compile for Tangerine Whistle and run it on Tangerine Whistle it is fine, the only problem is if you compile for pre-Tangerine Whistle and run it on Tangerine Whistle.

What we could do is implement a check if the gas computaiton wraps around, but the cost for that computation would have to be included in the number that is subtracted, so it gets even more messy.

I would just ignore this very specific problem. It is fixed in latest solidity because it defaults to a byzantium VM.

Are there any situations where this could be used to fool users?

@axic what do you think?

Somewhat OT:

@axic mentions in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2673#issuecomment-319183436:

> I think the best solution would be forwarding the maximum gas possible to ecrecover/sha256/ripemd160 and disallowing overriding them.

Is this worth re-considering?..

@veox this is the case with a post-TangerineWhistle VM.

If we can trust that the compiler calculates that value properly, then no matter if it wrapped or not, it will run out of gas. Doesn't it?

If it wraps, then it will be a very large number, which tangerine whistle VMs just truncate to the max available gas, so it should be working?

Yes, I also think it is fine.

We could consider though adding test cases with limited gas supplied to verify these assumptions.
