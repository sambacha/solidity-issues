# [\#3695 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3695) `closed`: 0.4.21 update breaks go-ethereum makeArgs function: "unrecognized option --add-std"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8369508?u=989321070cb2a1dead3d88866b2e92aaaeb7dd20&v=4" width="50">[jeffwalsh](https://github.com/jeffwalsh) opened issue at [2018-03-09 01:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3695):

Hi. I install solc in Travis CI through the ppa and noticed my build was broken today. I updated solc locally and now find updating solc is the issue.

```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y solc
```

Trying to use the go-ethereum Solidity compiler results in this error now:

```
solc: exit status 1
		unrecognised option '--add-std'
```

Which comes from the `Solidity.makeArgs()` function in `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common/compiler`, which is used by my app indirectly via `compiler.CompileSolidityString("", solidityString)`. 
Not sure if an `--add-std` option was removed with the patch yesterday or if I've done something wrong here.

This actually was removed in 5ab4a1ae7819004415293bf72a86824beb43cd51, @chriseth we should have mentioned it in the changelog.

The actual feature was removed probably 15 releases ago, just the option was left for "backwards compatibility", but it didn't actually do anything.

@karalabe @holiman can that option be removed from go-ethereum?

fixed in go-ethereum, leave issue open until they fix in others (ie: EthWorks/ethereum.rb) ?

How did you install 0.4.21? I updated truffle and it's still on 4.19

Same issue with pyethereum. We had this option in there always on and just noticed it went missing through Raiden.

Please add it to the changelog so that it's easier to spot when choosing to upgrade.

@quantumproducer I installed directly through apt on Ubuntu by adding the ethereum/ethereum PPA.

Same issue when I was using abigen, 
`abigen --sol token.sol --pkg token --lang go --out token.go`
Trying to bind solidity with abigen command,  results in this error:
```
Failed to build Solidity contract: solc: exit status 1
unrecognised option '--add-std'
```
I find use func in go-ethereum "compiler.CompileSolidity(*solcFlag, *solFlag),"  it's a solc command operation.
```
--combined-json
bin,abi,userdoc,devdoc,metadata
--add-std
--optimize
--
token.sol
```
but"--add-std" arg, deprecated in solidity 0.4.21
fixed in go-ethereum , please

The flag removal was shipped in Geth 1.8.3 two weeks ago.

I have the same issue when using abigen:
`abigen -sol inbox.sol -pkg contracts -out inbox.go`
I got the same error as:
`Failed to build Solidity contract: solc: exit status 1
unrecognised option '--add-std'
`
my geth version is `1.8.15-stable` , and solc version is `0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Linux.g++`
how can I fix it?

@Night-mk As pointed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3695#issuecomment-380361834, Geth already had a fix. Could you please try it with updated Geth and Solidity?

I've checked the geth 1.8.15 source and it doesn't seem to have `--add-std` in it. Closing. Please reopen if the issue persists, could also check geth 1.8.18.
