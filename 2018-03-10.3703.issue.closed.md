```
browser/ballot.sol:61:13: Warning: Using contract member "balance" inherited from the address type is deprecated. Convert the contract to "address" type to access the member.
    require(this.balance >= 1000000000000000);
```

What does it mean "convert the contract to address" type? How do I get the address of `this`?

From readthedocs:


```
All contracts inherit the members of address, so it is possible to query the balance of the current contract using this.balance.
```

We should both improve the documentation and the suggested way to silence the warning.

@quantumproducer you can use `address(this).balance`.

or you can use like this

```
address thisAddress = this;
thisAddress.balance
```

So can we not use `this` as an implicit address anymore?
