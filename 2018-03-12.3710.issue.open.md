currently the JSON is defined as a plain array of either an event or function - this works but is a bit suboptimal to parse with parsers like [moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which is very efficient and common in the Android space.
I would suggest a change to the following:

```json
{
 "events":[ ... ],
 "functions":[ ... ],
 "constructor":{ ... }
}
```

So one can easily parse from a given model which is not possible currently. Also it improves upgradeability. We can even introduce a version flag and maybe other metadata this way:

```json
{
 "version":2,
 "events":[ ... ],
 "functions":[ ... ],
 "constructor":{ ... }
}
```

Also code that just wants to call contracts can completely omit and not parse events and the constructor.
