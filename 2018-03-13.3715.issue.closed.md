Just want to get thoughts on the idea and bring up some discussion.

Sorry, but I don't really understand. How does Solidity relate to HTTP? Is this the right repository for this issue?

Should this be more directed toward the EVM? I can see a lot of value saving the state of an HTTP request in an Ethereum block and using the values in some way to calculate something.

The abstracted Ethereum Virtual Machine cannot initiate or even sustain HTTP requests. Please open a question at https://ethereum.stackexchange.com and perhaps read https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/2/how-can-an-ethereum-contract-get-data-from-a-website

If you are serious with such changes, you should consider opening an EIP at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs.

The Solidity repository is certainly too high-level for such things.
