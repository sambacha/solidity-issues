Necessary changes are on branch ``updateConstructorVersionPragmas`` - I was not sure about creating a pull request, since this has to be merged simultanously with the 0.4.22 release.

@ekpyron do you want to create the PR off that branch?

Do we have a convention for dealing with, resp. naming PRs in such cases?

I'm not sure about the release process so far, so I wasn't sure whether this should be a PR at all or whether the branch would just be merged into the release PR...
