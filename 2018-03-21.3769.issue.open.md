This would simplify the code in `ExpressionCompiler` added by #3308.

@chriseth Hmm, is this still relevant?

I'm not sure if it's still relevant but I wanted to add that this is probably much simpler now than it was back then. `TupleType` and `ReferenceType` both inherit from `CompositeType` (#9746) so we could just move the pure virtual declarations of these functions there.
