My system already has python installed. Still when installing dependencies I see the line `Downloading https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/Python-3.6.4.tar.xz`. This could be skipped If the system already has the required dependencies, removing redundancy.

Where exactly do you see that? What platform and packaging system do you sue to build solidity?
