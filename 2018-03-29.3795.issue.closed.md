Can you describe the scenario in which you run this in a little more detail, please?

Sorry, what I meant to ask was, how did you set up your blockchain? What is the actual balance of that account? `gethEth` and `getBalance` could be consistent with each other, but these numbers are certainly not something you would see in a production blockchain.

this is my  blockchain. the balance of eth.accounts[0] should be 5.31827682037048e+23,but contract HelloWorld's function  getBalance(eth.accounts[0])  is 1.15792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039455084007913129639935e+77,so I want to know why get so big number!

Since the contract is very simple, I do not think this is a problem with solidity. You might get better answers (and perhaps also by people who speak chinese) at https://ethereum.stackexchange.com

I think for some reason all bits (or at least the top bit) are set for the balance, hence the `int256(_addr.balance)` returns a negative number.

It is impossible to know without seeing the configuration for your chain and tools (the client, the tool you use to interact with the RPC, web3.js, etc.).

Please try your contract in https://remix.ethereum.org (where it actually works).

Hello, my client is the geth command compiled by go-etherum-1.8.1, and the private chain built with this is not called RPC, and the client is set to: geth --networkid... --datadir my dir --syncmode full --port my IP --rpcapi net,eth,web3,personal -- RPC --rpcaddr my RPC IP --rpcport my RPC port console.
I'm going to convert the result strongly into int256 and I get a value of -250000000001, the number of digits may be wrong, but it's a negative number, and it starts at -25 and the last one is 1.
