# [\#3811 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3811) `closed`: Bool variables should not allow comparison/bitwise operators

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-04-03 16:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3811):

```
bool a = true;
bool b = false;
bool c;

// compiles
c = a < b;
c = a <= b;
c = a > b;
c = a >= b;

// rejected
c = a | b; // bitwise or
c = a ^ b; // bitwise xor
c = a & b; // bitwise and
c = a << b; // shifts (all of them are properly rejected)
// add, sub, mul, div, mod and exp is rejected
```

Only logical `and` and `or` and (non)equality should be supported.

Oh wow, bitwise or compiles, but bitwise and does not??

Cannot reproduce (bitwise or).

This might be something for Christian to do together with someone else.

It doesn't work here anymore, probably had a wrong version of the binary. The rest still stands.

Ah wait a second, it is a change in `binaryOperatorResult` where we do not have access to the pragma, so probably cannot be done as of now.

It might be worth considering whether the conversion functions in the Type class and its subclasses could receive a flag that tells whether 050 is active or not.
