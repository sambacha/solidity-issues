# [\#3823 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3823) `closed`: Assertions (division?) hangs with z3
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following snippet (extracted from https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) hangs with the SMT checker turned on:

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

library SafeMath {

  /**
  * @dev Multiplies two numbers, throws on overflow.
  */
  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a * b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
  }
}
```

I've tried it on 4.6.0.

Right now I'm testing two examples:
```
(declare-fun c () Int)
(declare-fun a () Int)
(declare-fun b () Int)
(assert (> a 0))
(assert (= c (* a b)))
(assert (not (= b (div c a))))
(check-sat)
```
and
```
(declare-fun c (Int) Int)
(declare-fun a (Int) Int)
(declare-fun b (Int) Int)
(assert (> (a 0) 0))
(assert (= (c 0) (* (a 0) (b 0))))
(assert (not (= (b 0) (div (c 0) (a 0)))))
(check-sat)
```

`z3` says unknown for the first and hangs on the second.
`cvc4` says unsat for the first and unknown for the second.

Btw, I'm using `z3 4.5.0`

Latest `z3` actually hangs on both.

This now finishes in 10 seconds (just before the timeout kicks in) for me on Z3:

Yea but apparently couldn't it solve anyway =/

@axic Can we close this?

Well it doesn't hang. Do we need another issue to track if it solves it wrongly?

I don't think it solves it wrongly either, it just doesn't solve it. We'll have to live with unsolved nonlinear cases ;)
In any case, I think CVC4 actually solves this.

Workarounded by #3972 and hopefully with #4351 this is a lesser issue.
