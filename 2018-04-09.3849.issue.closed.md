Hello,

http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/solidity-by-example.html?#safe-remote-purchase . 
In the "Purchase" contract , the constructor function of Purchase() should also set the 'state' state variable as State.Created.
Otherwise the abort(), confirmPurchase() functions will not work.
Please confirm if understanding is correct.

Thanks,

Almost! The default value is already `State.Created`. It would probably be good to mention this in the text.

@chriseth , please correct me if I am wrong. I am assuming that in the comment section (in text) we need to include "how state variable is stated" to users. Isn't?

@chriseth I think it makes actually more sense to explicitly set the state variable either in the constructor or at declaration time. Otherwise it should link to a section which explains what default value `enum`s are taking.

Yep, we could mention it right before the state variable itself.

I think it is better to explain the default value than setting it, because it is a well-defined feature that can be used by users.
