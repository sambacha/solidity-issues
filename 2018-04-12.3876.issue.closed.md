# [\#3876 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3876) `closed`: ABI decoding API
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-04-12 15:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3876):

Split off #1707.

With #1707 an ABI encoding API was introduced:
- `abi.encode(...) -> bytes`
- `abi.encodePacked(...) -> bytes`
- `abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4, ...) -> bytes`
- `abi.encodeWithSignature(string, ...) -> bytes`

It would be natural to extend this with a decoding counterpart.

Listing here a couple of options as they came up historically:

1) The first suggestion has been `decode[T1,...,Tn](input)` where `Ti` is a type.

For example:
- `decode[uint, uint, string](data) -> uint, uint, string`
- `decode[bytes4, uint, uint, string](data) -> bytes4, uint, uint, string` (`msg.data` with selector`)

2) Alternative syntax to this is `decode<T1,...,Tn>(input)`.

3) Potentially the types could be string literals (and not types): `decode<"uint","uint","string">(input)` and if that is allowed, it could also use variables.

4) It also may make sense to introduce tuple types and make use of them: `decode<(uint,uint,string)](input)` (this really makes sense if tuple types are first class and can be passed around).

5) Other suggestions included passing the types as a string: `decode("bytes4,uint,uint,string", input)`

6) And having a `decode` overload over function types:

```
function (uint, uint, string) f;
f.decode() -> uint, uint
```

But since function types have no names, the selector cannot be computed without passing it explicitly:
```
function (uint, uint, string) f;
// assuming this would throw if there's a selector mismatch
f.decode("f(uint,uint,string)") -> uint, uint
```

Some notes;

 - the return type of the decode function has to be a compile-time constant, so anything that utilizes strings has no real benefit over the types themselves.
 - `[...]` is easier to parse than `<...>`.
 - another option might be just `abi.decode((uint, uint, uint[]), data)` or  `abi.decode([uint, uint, uint[]], data)` or even `abi.decode(data, uint, string, uint[])`.

Especially the third option would not even need any modifications to the parser.

I think I like the following if no parser changes are allowed:
- `abi.decode(input, T1, ...,  Tn) -> T1, ..., Tn`
- `abi.decodeWithSelector(input, T1, ..., Tn) -> bytes4, T1, ..., Tn`

But it also could use modifier functions (like `value()` and `gas()` - I'd suggest `types`, `fields` or `members`):
- `abi.decode.types(T1, ...,  Tn)(input) -> T1, ..., Tn`
- `abi.decodeWithSelector.types(T1, ..., Tn)(input) -> bytes4, T1, ..., Tn`

This could also be used as a type annotation on the encoders too: `abi.encodeWithSelector.types(uint256,uint8,bytes)("f()", a, b, c)`

Then again if the goal is visibility, it would make sense making them stand out syntactically:
- `abi.decodeWithSelector<uint256,uint8,bytes)(input)`
- `abi.encodeWithSelector<uint256,uint8,bytes)("f()", a, b, c)`

I think I would also prefer the template style, but we have to see how easy that is to implement in the parser. The problem is that `<` is also used as a binary operator, while `[` only has a bracket-like functionality.

If I could only wish for one early Christmas gift, this would be it.

This is requested a lot, and I actually think that at least `abi.decode(data, T1, T2, ...., Tn) -> T1, T2, ..., Tn` shouldn't be too hard to implement. Should we give it a shot for 0.5.0?

Yes -- this will accelerate state channels adoption.

If we add things like `functionName.returnTypes` it might be better to use `abi.decode(data, (T1, T2, ...., Tn)) -> T1, T2, ..., Tn`, also it kind of looks cleaner to me. Does anyone think this would be too complicated? For single types, we could also allow `abi.decode(data, uint) -> uint` without parentheses (`(uint)` and `uint` is treated identical by the type checker anyway).

@chriseth 

Posted the following 2 questions in the PR, but here seems more appropriated ; 

Would the format `abi.decode(data, (type1, type2, ...))` allow for predefined decoding patterns?

e.g.
```javascript
struct TransferArgs{
  address from;
  address to;
  uint256 amount;
}
```
and then `TransferArgs memory transferArgs = abi.decode(data, TransferArgs)`? What would the argument be to use this tupple format otherwise?

Also, I assume it will be possible, but just to be sure, will it be possible to decode the first n types and then pack the rest is a bytes array? Something like `abi.decode(data, (address, bytes))` instead of `abi.decode(data, (address, address, uint256))`.

Structs will be supported if you enable `ABIEncoderV2`. Partial decoding sounds useful but is probably not part of the first iteration. I would imagine something like: `x = abi.decode(data, (address, bytes, uint256))` and then using `x[0]` actually only performs the decoding.

And `x[0]` would return `address`, the first element to be decoded?

Yes, indeed. It would be better to also access elements by name, so I think this should still be refined.

But once we have that, we might in the future also apply this lazy decoding to functions in general.

It does sound more efficient. Good idea.

Passing the types as a string would appear to be most flexible imo.

Finally with Solidity 0.6.x you can do this:
```solidity
(uint256 a, string memory b) = abi.decode(abi.encodePacked(data[4:]), (uint256,string));
```
