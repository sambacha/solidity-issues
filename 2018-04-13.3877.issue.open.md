# [\#3877 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3877) `open`: Revise "this" warning for constructors.

In #3875 the warning about the use of "this" in constructors was revised to reduce false positives.

However, now there are cases like ``C c = this; c.f();`` that could be detected at compile-time, but are not warned about.

A general compile-time pure expression evaluator may help in detecting these cases.
