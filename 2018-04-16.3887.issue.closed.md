# [\#3887 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3887) `closed`: Recommended use of 'emit' invalid inside tuples
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Solidity 0.4.21 provides a warning when not using `emit` with events:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.3;

contract Test {
event __SomeEvent();

    function a() public {
        bool x = true;
        bool y = true;
        (x) ? ( __SomeEvent(), y=false) : (__SomeEvent(), y = false);
    }
}
```

However, inserting `emit` causes compilation to fail with: `ParserError: Expected token Comma got 'Identifier'
        (x) ? ( emit __SomeEvent(), y=false) : (emit __SomeEvent(), y = false);`

Was this use never really supported? Or was this regression an oversight when `emit` was introduced? I could certainly believe either scenario!

Oh wow, someone found an edge case in the parser :)

Did you use an automated tool for that?

The thing is that `emit` is not really a keyword. It will be a keyword in 0.5.0 and until then, we just try to parse otherwise invalid input correctly according to the new rules.

I would actually say that the specific code you gave should be invalid even with the old rules, since you create a tuple with a component that has a null type (events do not return anything).

Yeah, this is how we've been instrumenting ternary statements in [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/), because it was the only way to use the comma 'operator'. 

> The thing is that emit is not really a keyword. It will be a keyword in 0.5.0

Does this mean this could be expected to start working again in 0.5.0? (Assuming that you don't nix tuples with components with null types... it sounds like I may have shot myself in the foot!)

it might work with 0.5.0, but let me actually check, this bug might lie deeper than just what is visible with emit.

Yes, this should also be an error:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.3;

contract Test {
    function f() {}

    function a() public {
        bool x = true;
        bool y = true;
        (x) ? ( f(), y=false) : (f(), y = false);
    }
}
```

In general, it should not be possible to use events outside of the statement level. #3889 should get us closer there.

Oh I'm sorry, now I only understand that this breaks your functionality.

I guess you have to translate ternary statements even more into proper if statements.

That's fine. For the greater good!

Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is where we're going to have to go now. Thanks for being so responsive.
