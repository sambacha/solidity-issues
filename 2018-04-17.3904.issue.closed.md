# [\#3904 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3904) `closed`: New `constructor` incompatible with fallback function
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

With the advent of #3526 in solidity 0.4.22, it would appear that the new constructor keyword stops you having both an empty constructor and a fallback function in the same contract.

Given the following code, contract A will complain that the constructor and fallback have the same name and arguments.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;

contract A {
    address owner;
    
    constructor () internal {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
    
    function () payable {
        revert();
    }
}

contract B is A {
    uint supply;
    
    constructor () public {
        supply = 10 ether;
    }
}
```

This is the error returned:

```
test.sol:6:5: DeclarationError: Function with same name and arguments defined twice.
    constructor () internal {
    ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
test.sol:10:5: Other declaration is here:
    function () payable {
    ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

Argh that's embarassing. I guess we will need a new release soon... Thanks for the report!
