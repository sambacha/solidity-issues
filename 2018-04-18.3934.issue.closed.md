@axic can you provide a little bit more information what kind of "different" version that should be? If it is a "help-wanted" issue, it should be clear what is to be done. Thanks!

I've deliberately left it out because at the time it was created we were close to merge the version update :)

Now it can be clearly said: Solidity uses 1.8.4 as a built in. The test setup should have 1.7.7 installed in the system.

Seems gitcoinbot doesn't realize my previous comment.

@axic could you add some details on what the problem actually is? And is there any details on what does install mean? I am able to build the project on linux machine locally and build it on circleci though.

In `build_x86_linux` and `build_x86_mac` circleci targets a jsoncpp library must be installed on the underlying OS.

This jsoncpp version must be <1.8.0.

@alibabe does this help?
