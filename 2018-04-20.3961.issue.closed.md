It would be great if there were some examples of how to encode multi-dimensional dynamic collections. It is a bit confusing to derive from the formal specification and I was not able to find many unit tests on this in web3 libraries. The only one I found lead me to an error while implementing my own encoding https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/1570.

I plan to outline multidemensional abi encoding with the already working examples I have.
