# [\#3965 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3965) `closed`: Change m_bytes to unsigned in FixedBytesType
**Labels**: `help wanted`, `good first issue`

The member variable `m_bytes` is signed, although it can never be negative. We should change its type to be unsigned.

@chriseth I cannot find where we had a thread about this, but it seemed it was just left there as a legacy and it doesn't really make sense anymore

Great, thanks! It should not be such a big deal, the problem is that this tiny change might incur other changes in various parts of the code :)

Awesome.  Probably overly excited about this because I love the blockchain ecosystem!

hi from gitcoin.  

as a general rule, we tend to treat the person who 'started work' first as having precedence over the issue, but you all are welcome to work together to split the bounty or come to some other agreement.  

as a 'fix it twice' for our system, i've gone in and put the following PR in for gitcoin ( https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/pull/1024/ ) which will hopefully make it more clear what the ground rules are for future bounty hunters.

thanks for your continued patience as we evolve our software.

best,
kevin
