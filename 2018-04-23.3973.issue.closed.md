# [\#3973 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3973) `closed`: Remix: Emitting a non-existing event creates an "unexpected error during compilation"
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2018-04-23 04:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3973):

Source code to spawn this error in remix:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract Bug{
    uint256 Test;

    function TestFunc(){
        emit Test();
    }
}
```
    
Emitting non-event types spawns this "unexpected error" which makes this harder to debug.

I have not checked if this is a general solidity compiler bug, but it happens in remix.
