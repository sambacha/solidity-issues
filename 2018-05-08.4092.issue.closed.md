# [\#4092 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4092) `closed`: Update swarm hashing method

Apparently the Swarm hashing method has changed to a different one, called Pyramid hash, which uses its own wrapper over Keccak256 named BMT (Binary Merkle Tree, iirc) hash:

https://github.com/ethersphere/go-ethereum/blob/swarm-network-rewrite/swarm/storage/pyramid.go

Tests (at the bottom of the file): https://github.com/ethersphere/go-ethereum/blob/swarm-network-rewrite/swarm/storage/chunker_test.go

This means the current hashes we include are useless as they are valid in "PoC-2" and not valid in the current "PoC-3".

We should also evaluate whether the swarm has is actually what we want, perhaps most users store the source code on ipfs instead?

Clarification: the above change is about to happen, but hasn't happened yet.

I'd prefer to have both, perhaps controlled by a setting in the standard JSON.

Actually have written an IPFS hasher in Javascript (it is messy, because it uses ProtoBuf to encode internally) a while back and started to do it in C++, but didn't finish that. Should finish it.

This seems to be a reference implementation: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/swarm/bmt/bmt_r.go
