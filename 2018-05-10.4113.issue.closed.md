# [\#4113 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4113) `closed`: Yul: optimisation steps for switch vs. if statements

I think the code generated for `if` statements is more optimised than their `switch` counterparts, which is expected, so I'd suggest we have an optimiser stage which translates all single-case `switch` statements to `if` statements.

If this is implemented, the code generator should not try to optimise if a `switch` statement has only one case.

Has been implemented in #5290
