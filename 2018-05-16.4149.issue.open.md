It would make sense for the Remix static analyzer to suggest the minimum compiler version needed after considering all the language features used in the source code.

It should suggest the proper version pragma or complain in the version pragma present states an earlier version.

@axic Sounds good, can you provide me with a list of features introduced in each compiler version?
