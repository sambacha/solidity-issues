Here is a full translation but it is out of date: https://solidity-es.readthedocs.io/es/latest/

Hey @naitsirhc007 as part of many other docs efforts, I am handling translations. Are you, or @eleanarey interested in continuing this Spanish translation? I have a plan in place and am happy to help you with whatever you need.
