`bytes` and `strings` are not value types, so they should not appear in the value types section in the documentation.

---

So in the official [doc](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#dynamically-sized-byte-array), it says 

bytes: Dynamically-sized byte array, see Arrays. Not a value-type!

string: Dynamically-sized UTF-8-encoded string, see Arrays. Not a value-type!

If they are not a value-type, why are they placed in Value Types section? It is quite confusing.

@wjmelements you do not need to cross-reference pull requests, github does that automatically (see above).
