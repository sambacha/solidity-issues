# [\#4254 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4254) `closed`: constructor public by default

constructor requires public keyword, but should be public by default I believe

```

contract Foo {
   constructor(){//..}
}
```

versus 

```
contract Foo {
   constructor() public{//..}
}
```

@benjyz This behaviour is by design. The reasoning behind it is, that making something externally accessible should be a concious decision made by the programmer. Please see #2608 for further discussion on the default visibility of functions.
