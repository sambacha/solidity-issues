# [\#4310 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4310) `closed`: Failed to call an external function of another contract

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429600?v=4" width="50">[evgen-povt](https://github.com/evgen-povt) opened issue at [2018-06-18 08:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4310):

**Which version of Solidity you are using**
0.4.21 vs 0.4.24

**What was the source code**
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.21;

contract Contract1 {
    uint256 private diff = 15;

    function getNumber(uint256 _seed) external view returns (uint256) {
        return _seed + diff;
    }
}

contract Contract2 {
    uint256 public value;
    Contract1 public contract1;

    function Contract2(address _contract1) public {
        contract1 = Contract1(_contract1);
    }

    function getContractValue(uint256 _seed) public {
        value = contract1.getNumber(_seed);
    }
}
```

**Which platform are you running on**
Remix IDE + geth 1.8.11-stable on Mac

**How to reproduce the issue**
1. Deploy Contract1
2. Deploy Contract2 with address of Contract1 as an argument of the constructor
3. Make a call of Contract2.getContractValue(10)

**What was the result of the issue**
The steps above work if the contracts are compiled with compiler 0.4.21.
But they fail if the contracts are compiled with compiler 0.4.24
Also in both cases the compiler prints warning 'Gas requirement of function Contract2.getContractValue(uint256) high: infinite.'

**What the expected behaviour is**
The contracts should work when compiled with 0.4.24
There is no the warning message.

@evgen-povt Could you please give some more information on your OS and web browser? Your issue seems to be related to #4162 which we're currently trying to track down.

@bit-shift 
OS: macOS Sierra 10.12.6
Geth: Geth/v1.8.11-stable/darwin-amd64/go1.10.3
Browser: Google Chrome Version 67.0.3396.87 (Official Build) (64-bit)

The difference with the #4162 is that my case has a warning for 0.4.21 either.

**And one major thing**: Remix IDE is connected to the geth node, not Javascript VM.

I think the problem here is that you did not enable Byzantium mode in geth: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/16931

Should be solved by #4259.

Please comment if using byzantium mode in geth didn't solve the problem.
