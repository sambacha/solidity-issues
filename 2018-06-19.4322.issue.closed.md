# [\#4322 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4322) `closed`: Function signature returns a named variable `sum`, assigning to it and returning something else should trigger compiler warning?

```

    function Foo(uint a, uint b) pure public returns (uint sum) {
        sum = a + b;
    }
    
    // TypeError: Different number of arguments in return statement than in returns declaration.
    // function Bar(uint a, uint b) public {
    //     return a + b;
    // }
    
    function Baz(uint a, uint b) pure public returns (uint sum) {
        return a * b; 
    }
    
    function Foo2(uint a, uint b) pure public returns (uint sum) {
        sum = a + b;
        uint somethingElse = 123; // something random
        return somethingElse;
    }
}

6 months ago I didn't know how to use Remix and Metamask to deploy ERC20... No wonder why I didn't know this syntax: https://github.com/kleros/openiico-contract/issues/34

I believe that `foo2` is potentially confusing, should trigger warning.

I think this tracked in #708 (also relevant #3134). Please comment if you think those issues are not enough to discuss the problem.

@axic of course you are right, I should use "search" option first.

Me = data point. It's really really confusing.
