Latest develop version:
```
tarski:build dejan$ ./solc/solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.25-develop.2018.6.30+commit.e289c361.Darwin.appleclang
```

Basic compile reports leaks with valgrind. This is Mac, but same happens on linux too:

Hi @dddejan , thanks for reporting! I'll forward the issue to Z3.

Is it an issue with Z3? 

I've been using Z3 in other projects and I haven't seen leakage. My experience is through the C interface, but that one also routes through C++.

It seems so. I ran it locally on my Linux build and Valgrind reports leaks already when instantiating the solver, but also when declaring an integer, for example.

@leonardoalt did you manage to open an issue for this? If so, can you link it here?

Not yet, I want to write a minimal example to analyse it better.

When I run a simple Solidity example (one false assertion) I don't get as many "definitely lost" bytes:
```
==22750== LEAK SUMMARY:
==22750==    definitely lost: 26 bytes in 1 blocks
==22750==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

==22750==    still reachable: 9,846 bytes in 18 blocks
==22750==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
```
The "definitely lost" seem to be related to `libcln`:
```
==22750== 26 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 32 of 119

```

@dddejan Could you please post your `simple.sol` if you still have it?

In any case, I ran `z3` with a small example and the report looks like the one I get with Solidity:
```

Z3 issue: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/1941

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1482564?u=539d1592b88943f77df13809d6172ad7fa6a06b3&v=4" width="50">[dddejan](https://github.com/dddejan) commented at [2018-06-30 20:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4391#issuecomment-440315867):

I used the simple example from the documentation

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.6.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData;

    function set(uint x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

Without any options valgrind reports 

```
==27814== HEAP SUMMARY:
==27814==     in use at exit: 138,024 bytes in 99 blocks
==27814==   total heap usage: 6,876 allocs, 6,777 frees, 1,096,949 bytes allocated
==27814==

==27814==    still reachable: 216 bytes in 2 blocks
==27814==         suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==27814== Rerun with --leak-check=full to see details of leaked memory
```

But, running with `--leak-check=full` returns pages of reports of "possibly lost" coming from Z3.

This is with latest solidity and Z3 from git on both linux and mac.

Thanks!

I'm closing this after the reply on the Z3 issue.
