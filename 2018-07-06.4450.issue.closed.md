@Colonel86 Fixed point types are not fully supported yet. The section https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#fixed-point-numbers contains a warning, stating that they can be declared, but cannot be assigned to or from. It's also still undecided which of the upcoming compiler versions will support them.

@bit-shift  I understand what that means
"they can be declared"
` 
ufixed128x18 f;  
`
it's allow。

 "but cannot be assigned to or from" 
`
ufixed128x18 f= 1.23;

ufixed128x18 f1;

f1 = 3.45;
`
it's not allow.

@bit-shift Thank you. If you are a relevant staff member who wishes to make the documentation more clear, or if you are not a good feature for this support, you should remove it, or describe it in a unified place
