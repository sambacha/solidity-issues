# [\#4494 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4494) `closed`: Solc should output something if no output is selected

From the zeppelin audit:

If no output format is specified (those listed under ‚ÄúOutput Components‚Äù by solc --help), solc will not do any sort of output, but also won‚Äôt issue any warnings or notices. This behaviour is confusing, and makes it difficult for new users to understand why their invocation is failing.
Consider either adding a message when no output format is selected, or selecting one (e.g. binary) by default.

--

We should add a message like `Source files are valid, but no output requested.`

I think this is a good idea and should clear ambiguity. The goal here is to modify `solc` such that it will output the `Source files are valid, but no output requested.` message if no output artifacts are requested.

@anurag-git wonderful! I think this should be a rather small change in CommanlineInterface.cpp. Create a new branch with a pull request against the develop branch. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask, perhaps also in http://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev.

Hi,

Thanks for the reply.

I forked my own repo and start building the project by following
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source
".
But I see the error mentioned below. I am trying to debug it but any help
would be appreciated.

[  4%] Built target jsoncpp-project
Makefile:129: recipe for target 'all' failed

@faizabidi in general, yes, but there have been some discussions about how to do this properly, perhaps it could be more difficult than you think, but please give it a shot!

@faizabidi the problem is that there are many different combinations of commandline flags to consider and it is easy to miss a combination. I think the final conclusion was to add a helper function that can be used to retrieve `std::cout` and which also registers that it has been accessed. If it has not been accessed, the message is output at the end.

@chriseth,
If you can tell me, all the new scenarios which you can think of, then I
can still work with old approach and make it work.
If startegy is only for new approach, then I would let others handle it.

Regards,
Anurag Dashputre

That's the thing - there are too many different scenarios to consider and it is way too easy to forget about one (especially when new ones are added).

Thanks @vs77bb but as discussed with @chriseth , the right approach is still not finalised. I spent almost 2 weeks, trying to fix all the possible scenarios I could think of but still few scenarios were identified by Chris.
