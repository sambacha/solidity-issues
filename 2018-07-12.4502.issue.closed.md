# [\#4502 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4502) `closed`: Introduce static elementary types to use
**Labels**: `help wanted`, `good first issue`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`, `difficulty: easy`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-07-12 18:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4502):

Code like `IntegerType(160, IntegerType::Modifier::Address);` is very common and should be replaced by something like `ElementaryTypes::Address` (i.e. ElementaryTypes should be a struct that contains several static members initialized to specific instances of the types) at least for the more common elementary types to improve readability.

Note that the Type class inherits from `std::enabled_shared_from_this` and thus is always a `shared_ptr`. The elements of the `ElementaryTypes` struct should be the types themselves, but this has to be checked during implementation what is more common.

The elementary types should be:

`bytes32`, `byte`, `address`, `uint256` and others that are found in the code.

@chriseth can you please point me to places where i would need to make changes and add the struct containing Elementary types so that i can accelerate the work a bit , also i could not find any instances of `bytes32` , `unit256` or `bytes` being used like `IntegerType(160, IntegerType::Modifier::Address);`

@vaibhavchellani please start with all occurrences of `IntegerType(160, IntegerType::Modifier::Address)`. I think something like `ArrayType(DataLocation::Memory)` and `ArrayType(DataLocation::Memory, true)` should also be replaced by something like `ElementaryTypes::BytesMemory` and `ElementaryTypes::StringMemory`, respectively.

The struct should be placed in `Types.h`, I think.

I've replaced all occurrences of `IntegerType(160, IntegerType::Modifier::Address)` with `ElementaryTypes::Address`, `ArrayType(DataLocation::Memory)` with `ElementaryTypes::BytesMemory`, and `ArrayType(DataLocation::Memory, true)` with `ElementaryTypes::StringMemory`.
