# [\#4506 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4506) `closed`: Returning double array from library seems to have broken with 0.4.22
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

`a()` in the following works under 0.4.22, and throws `UnimplementedFeatureError: Nested memory arrays not yet implemented here` above:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

library aLib {
    struct aStruct {
        uint[10][51] values;
    }

    function getStruct(aStruct storage self) public constant returns(uint[10][51]) {
        return (self.values);
    }
}

contract Test {
    uint[10][51] array;
    aLib.aStruct theStruct;

    constructor(){}

    function a() public constant returns (uint[10][51]) {
        return aLib.getStruct(theStruct);
    }

    function b() public constant returns (uint[10][51]) {
        return array;
    }
} 
```

`b()` works fine across versions. Suspect this may be related to the changes to returning dynamic arrays in 0.4.22 but just guessing.

@jmahhh Did you test that on 0.4.21? I had a suspicion that this actually didn't work even though the compiler didn't complain, so I added a function in the library to set the values and tested it on Remix with 0.4.21: the compiler doesn't complain but the values come 0 anyway!
If the version is `>=0.4.22` and `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2` is used it works fine.
In any case this should work.

Hi @leonardoalt I see, my testing on 0.4.21 only went as far as the compiler, didn't actually check for return values. Thanks for the tip! Am I closing this?

Let's leave it open for now. I'm still checking which cases are buggy. We might rename the issue but keep the discussion.

@axic Consider the following code.
After testing on Remix, I have that
- function `values` works, returning `uint256[2][2]: 0,0,0,44975`
- function `libValues` returns `uint256[2][2]: 0,0,0,0`

This only happens to nested arrays (1D works with the library).

```
pragma solidity >=0.4.21;

library aLib {
    function values() public pure returns(uint[2][2]) {
        uint[2][2] memory v;
        v[1][1] = 0xcafe;
        return v;
    }
}

contract Test {
    function libValues() public pure returns (uint[2][2]) {
        return aLib.values();
    }
    
    function values() public pure returns (uint[2][2]) {
        uint[2][2] memory v;
        v[1][1] = 0xafaf;
        return v;
    }
}
```

I think in that case this is a compiler bug we should list. In 0.5.0 it is "fixed" by properly detecting in the typechecker that it is unsupported (but also alternatively ABIEncoderV2 works with it).

But why is it unsupported if it's fixed size?

Decision on call: Severity medium, potentially low/medium depending on whether this is out in the wild or not.

Analysis of Etherscan source data only revealed 7 functions that return nested statically-sized arrays and none of them is called externally from anywhere. @axic @holiman
