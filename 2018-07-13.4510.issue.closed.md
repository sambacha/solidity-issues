# [\#4510 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4510) `closed`: Proxy library always throws

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22256858?u=07b86c13cae3b8ba34a88fc20813dbeb5d40ab76&v=4" width="50">[kyriediculous](https://github.com/kyriediculous) opened issue at [2018-07-13 16:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4510):

Hello. 

I'm writing a dApp using an upgradeable architecture which I call 'Registered proxy libraries'.
Simply put it's a combination of proxy libraries and contract managers/registries. 

This is how it works
storage-contract ---delegateCall() --> Proxy --delegateCall() --> Library 

In this repository you will find multiple contracts following this architecture: https://github.com/kyriediculous/blockchain-programmable-incentives

People.sol follows the exact same architecture as Timesheet.sol however the timesheet workflow does not work.

Whenever a function is being called on my library through the proxy, the call reverts. This only the case for the timesheet workflow, the people workflow works like a charm. I'm completely confused as to why, as it is completely the same architecture. 

When I change the storage directly it all works (without going through the proxy to the library). When I just use the library and storage contracts in remix it works too. So there is some issue happening with delegating the calls.

By changing the storage i mean using

```
  function isAdmin(address _user) external view returns (bool) {
    return  _timesheet.admins[_user];
  }
```

instead of 
```

  function isAdmin(address _user) external view returns (bool) {
    return  _timesheet.isAdmin(_user);
  }
```

Any ideas? It seems like it's the revert statement in assembly (proxy) causing the issue but I have no idea as to why.. Thanks...

Short version of the code where on isAdmin() remains as funtion as example

```
imesheet (STORAGE) 

    pragma solidity ^0.4.23;
    
    import '../interface/timesheet-interface.sol';
    import '../registry/enabled.sol';
    import '../util/Ownable.sol';
    
    contract Timesheet is Ownable, Enabled {
      using TimesheetInterface for TimesheetInterface.Timesheets;
      TimesheetInterface.Timesheets _timesheet;
    
      function isAdmin(address _user) external view returns (bool) {
        return _timesheet.isAdmin(_user);
      }
    
    }

TimesheetInterface (INTERFACE)

    pragma solidity ^0.4.23;
    
    library TimesheetInterface {
      struct Period {
        uint start;
        uint end;
        bool closed;
        bool processed;
      }
    
      struct Periods {
        Period[] periods;
      }
    
      struct Timesheets {
        mapping (address => Periods) timesheet;
        mapping (address => bool) admins;
      }
    
     
      function isAdmin(Timesheets storage _timesheet, address _user) external view returns (bool);
    }


TimesheetProxy (PROXY) 

    pragma solidity ^0.4.23;
    /**
     * @title Proxy
     * @dev Gives the possibility to delegate any call to a foreign implementation.
     */
     import '../registry/contract-registry.sol';
     import '../registry/enabled.sol';

    contract TimesheetProxy is Enabled {
      /**
      * @dev Fallback function allowing to perform a delegatecall to the given implementation.
      * This function will return whatever the implementation call returns
      */
      function () payable public {
        ContractRegistry contractRegistry = ContractRegistry(CMC);
        address _impl = contractRegistry.getLibrary("timesheet");
        require(_impl != address(0));
    
        assembly {
          let ptr := mload(0x40)
          calldatacopy(ptr, 0, calldatasize)
          let result := delegatecall(gas, _impl, ptr, calldatasize, 0, 0)
          let size := returndatasize
          returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
    
          switch result
          case 0 { revert(ptr, size) }
          default { return(ptr, size) }
        }
      }
    }


TimesheetLib (LIBRARY)

    pragma solidity ^0.4.23;
    
    import '../interface/timesheet-interface.sol';
    
    library TimesheetLib {
      event logApprovePeriod(address indexed user, uint start, uint end, bool closed);
    
      function isAdmin(TimesheetInterface.Timesheets storage _timesheet, address _user) external view returns (bool) {
        return _timesheet.admins[_user];
      }
    }
```

Most of the time, such behaviour is caused by not using a byzantium EVM in the testnet. Where do you run your smart contracts?

I was using ganache 1.1.0 but got the same results using Remix JS VM. I haven't tested with Eth-clique yet.

It works now all of a sudden, I did some minor tweaks nothing breaking.

I went through my entry point contract now (which I did before too but didn't work either) and it seems to work.

Thanks for the always quick replies!

Nevermind.. forgot to set the contract manager address. RIP 20 Hours of my life...
