**Labels**: `feature`

Add "break" and "continue" with the usual semantics to Yul. This needs some changes (and further tests) in the following optimizer steps (might not be exhaustive):

Trivial:
 - ASTCopier (et al.)
 - ASTWalker (et al.)
 - DataFlowAnalyzer
 - RedundantAssignEliminator

The structural simplifier could need some additional rules (remove dead code after unconditional "continue" or "break"), but these might be added later.

"return" should not take any arguments.

We have a collision between the concept of returning from a function and the return opcode.

Brainstorming for renaming one of them:
 - finish
 - break_function
 - leave
 - exit

Split out the dead code removal into its own issue: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6328

Couldn't we just reuse `break`?
