**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Currently it seems to be pointing to "develop".

Maybe there should be '**develop**' too, in addition to '**latest**'... so that one could fix things like this!

Thanks! It's far below... didn't notice!

I don't see how this can be done. We can just remove `latest` - the "default" version is a different setting and it is set to 0.4.24.

It does look like RTD automates most of this, and while it may be possible to reorganise the repository branches and tags to get this working, it's probably a lot of work for a small return (IMO).
