# [\#4622 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4622) `open`: Clarify assembly grammar
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Currently there are two places for assembly grammar:
- grammar.txt
- the Yul chapter in the documentation

It would make sense to clarify them to have matching understanding or somehow merge the two (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3151#issuecomment-340270780 for more information).
