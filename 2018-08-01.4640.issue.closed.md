# [\#4640 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4640) `closed`: Add helper function that joins vectors of strings
**Labels**: `help wanted`, `good first issue`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`, `difficulty: easy`

Add a helper function to `CommonData.h` that takes a vector of strings (or perhaps just a template that can be used in a range-based for loop) that does the following:

Returns a single string where all elements are joined by a separator (default is `", "`) where optionally the last separator can be different (for example `" or "`).

The first one can be solved using boost::algorithm::join, but no the second use-case.

Example:

`["one", "to", "three"] -> `"one, to or three"`

Didn't thought too much... but what about
```cpp
#include <boost/algorithm/string/join.hpp>
#include <boost/algorithm/string/replace.hpp>

template<class T>
std::string join(T const &_list, std::string const &_separator = ", ", std::string const &_last = "")
{
	std::string result = boost::algorithm::join(_list, _separator);
	if (!_last.empty())
		boost::replace_last(result, _separator + _list.back(), _last + _list.back());
	return result;
}
```
