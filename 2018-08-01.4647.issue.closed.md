# [\#4647 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4647) `closed`: SMT: change value into <result> or something better

```
nonlinear.sol:7:12: Warning: Overflow (resulting value larger than 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff) happens here
        uint c = a * b;
                 ^---^
  for:
  a = 2
  b = 0x8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  c = 0
  value = 0x010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

In this example `value` corresponds to the unlimited precision result of the operation, which is then trunacted to the range of the output (in this case `c`)

I think `<result>` would be an appropriate replacement, especially as that is an invalid variable name and wouldn't be confused as a variable.
