Not sure whether ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` will work here. ``<LANG>`` would be ``CXX`` both for emscripten and gcc/clang/MSVC builds, wouldn't it?

I think it shouldn't be an emscripten specific option. I kind of have the feeling it shouldn't be turned on at all, since we do not have the proper attributes set on exported functions.

That may be - we should investigate this in more detail - I added this to ``0.5.1``, though, since the current workarounds seem to work and therefore I would say it's not "urgent".

@chfast can you shed a light if `<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` works well cmake?

Never heard of it, but looks promising. Build with make VERBOSE=1 and see the compiler flags.
