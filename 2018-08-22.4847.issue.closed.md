# [\#4847 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4847) `closed`: Automatic getters not recognised in interface implementations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2633913?u=b5e0f6d44cabdb8c7c83c8a8d0abb916f6c5b3b6&v=4" width="50">[adamdossa](https://github.com/adamdossa) opened issue at [2018-08-22 15:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4847):

## Description

In code like the below, `address public balance` has an automatic getter function (as can be seen in the corresponding ABI).

However we need to redefine it to avoid the compiler complaining that `Test` does not fully implement `ITest`.

Any idea if this is a bug or a feature (and if so why)?  

```
    pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
    
    interface ITest {
        function balance() external returns (address);
    }
    
    contract Test is ITest {
        address public balance;
        
        // Why is this function needed?
        function balance() public returns (address) {
            return balance;
        }
    }
```

This has another odd side-effect in code like the below, where it isn't possible to specify in an interface that there is a function `decimals` as your damned if you include it, and damned if you don't ;-).

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

interface HasDecimals {
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
}

contract DetailedERC20 {
  string public name;
  string public symbol;
  uint8 public decimals;

  constructor(string _name, string _symbol, uint8 _decimals) public {
    name = _name;
    symbol = _symbol;
    decimals = _decimals;
  }
}

contract Test is HasDecimals, DetailedERC20 {
    
    constructor (string _name, string _symbol, uint8 _decimals) public
        DetailedERC20(_name, _symbol, _decimals)
    {}
    
    //Uncommenting the below function gives a compile error:
    //DeclarationError: Identifier already declared
    //Commenting the below function gives a compile error:
    //Missing implementation: function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8) {
        return decimals;
    }

}
```

That's a good point. Actually, with the latest version you'll get an `already declared` error also for the first example.
Before I go ahead and call it a bug, we'll have to discuss what the expected behavior is; that is, whether the `public` state variable should implicitly implement the interface function or if those things should be separated on the language level.
I personally tend to the opinion that the variable accessor should implicitly implement the interface function.

Yep - I think since automatic getters are part of the language specification (and reflected in ABIs) they should be considered a match for the interface (which is effectively an ABI as it maps 1-1 with ABIs).

There are other oddities like my second comment above where it seems like if you're inheriting from a contract, the inheritance is done at the ABI level (so you can't redefine an existing function encoded as a public state variable) but if the public state variable is in the same contract, you're free to redefine its getter function.

This may be a duplicate of #3514.

Closing as duplicate although I though we already fixed that. *sigh*
