**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `breaking change :warning:`

Anything that resembles a (unicode)newline in `//`-comments should terminate the comment and perhaps also lead to a parser error.

A similar logic should be applied to strings.

Also note that `\r` is currently not even considered as whitespace in `scanToken`.
