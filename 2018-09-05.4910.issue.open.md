# [\#4910 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4910) `open`: Add .exists() and .iscontract() on to the address type
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

Not fully sure yet if `.exists()` can be implemented properly, but `.iscontract()` should be possible to be implemented via the `extcodesize` instruction.

With having `.iscontract()`, #4823 would not need to be implemented.

What would be the semantics of `.exists()`?

`.exists()` probably should be postponed until there is a consensus on what that means in Ethereum, however when looking at the account cleanup rules during creation/selfdestruct/etc. should be a good indication.

I actually don't think this can be done properly without support form a new EVM opcode, because one could check for balance and code size, but cannot check for storage, which is possible to be non-empty if the account is only used through delegatecalls.

I would be cautious of any implementation of `.iscontract()` -- the whole idea of testing `iscontract` has led to lots of contracts vulnerable to exploits done by constructors

Actually it seems that `.iscontract()` could be implemented by just using `extcodehash`.

`.exists()` can be clearly implemented post Constantinople, because [EIP-1052](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052) for `EXTCODEHASH` clearly defines it:
> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by EIP-161) 0 is pushed to the stack.

From [EIP-161](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161):
> An account is considered empty when it has no code and zero nonce and zero balance.

Similarly `.iscontract()` is clearly defined with EIP-1052:
> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470) is pushed to the stack.

@frangio @wadeAlexC any change of view since these are provided by opcodes now?

Since `EXTCODEHASH` returns a nonzero value during the constructor, this seems fine on the surface.

I don't think that really mitigates the vulnerabilities that can arise from using `.isContract()`, because an account can pass the `EXTCODEHASH` test but still become a contract in the future.

We do have an `isContract` function in OpenZeppelin though, because some ERCs require using it. So I think I would be okay with including it in Solidity. But it needs to be used carefully.

Would calling it `hasCode` help in any way?

Are we making commitments in the language that a property of an account in the state cannot ever change? :wink:

@frangio Could you elaborate this sentence?
