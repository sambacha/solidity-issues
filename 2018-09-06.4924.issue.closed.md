Everything until "Alternatively, there is a testing script at scripts/test.sh which ...." should also work on windows and the script is just a convenience way to run 'soltest'. What were your exact problems?

Note that not all tests that are run as part of the CI tests can be run on all platforms and might require additional software (node.js etc).

Two seconds sounds plausible. It did run all tests that do not need an Ethereum client - those tests take much longer (they are disabled via `--no-ipc`). The tests you ran include all syntax and type checking tests, but no semantics / end-to-end tests.

@lazaridiscom I could be at help here maybe, as I'm working coding on Solidity on both (Linux as well as on Windows, and even on Windows-Subsystem-for-Linux). It all works "just" fine, but documentation certainly could need an improvement. (I am using VS2017 latest version, with its built-in CMake-support).

So please contact me in Gitter, email or here, in case.
