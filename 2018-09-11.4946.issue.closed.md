# [\#4946 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4946) `closed`: Yul: make Simplifier optimizations work with SSA / "3AC"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-11 13:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4946):

The main thing that has to be changed is pattern matching, because they have to resolve subexpressions across variables.

The benefit of using SSA with 3AC for the simplifier is that we do not have to care about movability, because subexpressions are not modified.
