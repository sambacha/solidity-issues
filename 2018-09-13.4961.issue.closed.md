Which distribution are you working on? Is it in fact ``ubuntu artful``? In a current docker image of ``ubuntu artful`` the https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/releases/download/solidityTester/aleth_2018-06-20_artful works for me (given that gcc and libleveldb1v5 are installed).

If you use a different distribution you will probably have to compile from sources. The ``trusty`` binary is built on ``ubuntu trusty`` and meant to work against their binaries and the ``artful`` binary is built on ``ubuntu artful`` respectively.

The sources can be found here https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/releases/tag/solidityTester and the precise commits of ``aleth`` are documented there as well.

Note that we recently improved the compatibility of the tests with more recent ``aleth`` versions, so if you're working with the most recent version of solidity on the ``develop`` branch, the tests should work against aleth 1.4.0rc6, for which there are binaries that should work on ubuntu 18.04 out of the box (https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/releases/download/v1.4.0rc6/aleth-1.4.0rc6-linux-x86_64.tar.gz).
