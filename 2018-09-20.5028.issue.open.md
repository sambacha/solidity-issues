There are instructions on how to compile solc and soltest, there are also pre-compiled soljson releases in the solc-bin repository, but I can't seem to find any clear instructions on how to build soljson from the source?

The reason is because it is not that easy. There is the script `scripts/build_emscripten.sh` but it has some quirks. If you are up to it, we would love to have your feedback about it and incorporate it into the documentation.
