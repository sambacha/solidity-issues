# [\#5097 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5097) `closed`: Brainstorm scope of 0.6.0

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-26 12:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5097):

Likely candidates:
 - <external_function_type>.address #4994
 - disallow shadowing everywhere
 - introduce `virtual` and `override`
 - using L for a,b,c; #5018

I would also like to have the fallback function split, but we still have not decided on a name.

Perhaps we should not think about a full redesign of inheritance and just disallow what people annoys currently.

I'd like to add my most favorite contenders to your list:
* compile time evaluated functions (functions without side-effects and with input parameters known at compile time should not generate the CALL-opcodes but instead evaluate the result at compile-time and use that directly at runtime - this would requiere a TinyEVM within solidity)
* major rewrite of diagnostics reporting (so we can support syntax/colored output) to improve readability. -- there seems to be a heavily outdated POC PR: #3046
* [Language Server](https://langserver.org/) support!

> compile time evaluated functions 

#3157 & #3878

Can we move this into the project board? That requires adding these proposed items as issues.

I'm moving all the issues to the 0.6.0 project.

@christianparpart could you create issues for the first and the last item you raised?
