# [\#5118 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5118) `closed`: compiler [Stack too deep, try removing local variables] even return parameter number less than 7

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23724965?v=4" width="50">[passionofvc](https://github.com/passionofvc) opened issue at [2018-09-30 04:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5118):

try compile Test.sol it show me error, but replace last return parameter type to address , it compile well.
Does this is a compiler bug?
 
Test.sol:15:57: Compiler error: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.
         return (hash, prefix_hash, sig, owner, signer, amount);

## Environment

- Compiler version:
$ solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.25+commit.59dbf8f1.Darwin.appleclang

- Operating system:
$ sw_vers
ProductName:	Mac OS X
ProductVersion:	10.13.6
BuildVersion:	17G65

## Steps to Reproduce

```
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...

pragma solidity ^0.4.25;
 
 contract Test{
      address owner = msg.sender;
 
      function claimPayment(uint256 amount, uint256 nonce, bytes sig)
      view public returns (bytes32, bytes32, bytes, address, address, uint256) {
      //view public returns (bytes32, bytes32, bytes, address, address, address) {
 
          bytes32 hash  = keccak256( abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, amount, nonce, this) );
          bytes32 prefix_hash =  hash ;
 
          address signer =address(0);
          require(signer == owner);
          return (hash, prefix_hash, sig, owner, signer, amount);
          //return (hash, prefix_hash, sig, owner, signer, owner);
      }
 
 }
$ solc Test.sol 
Test.sol:15:57: Compiler error: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.
         return (hash, prefix_hash, sig, owner, signer, amount);
```

It is a limitation we will hopefully be able to lift soon, but not a bug. You could try to assign return values instead of using `return` and also split statements into multiple smaller ones.

The reason for the difference is not the number of bytes in the memory representation (which actually is 32 for both types if you read the ABI closely) but the fact that you read `owner` from storage and not from the stack.

hi @chriseth @lazaridiscom 
very thanks,

Please accept my apology for not being able to learn from 
[stackexchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/)

I will continue to learn ethereum, smart contract every day passionately.
