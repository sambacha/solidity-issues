I am having difficulty installing older versions of the solidity compiler on my Macbook Air (running MacOs High Sierra 10.13.6). The latest version 0.4.25 of solc installs fine.

I tried 0.4.11 and failed:

```

I tried 0.4.20 and failed also, but in a different way:

I disabled the checksum verification (yes, I know this is bad) and retried 0.4.11. This time another error that I have seen in another issue already where it was claimed to have been fixed. Apparently not for version 0.4.11...

We do not really support older versions, but it seems like you need to either install ccache or properly re-run the configuration (which seems to have detected that ccache is installed although it is not).

Unfortunately, we cannot really help you there. We try to keep solidity compilable on macos but do not really have the resources to properly support homebrew.

I found a workaround to the problem of installing older versions of the Solidity compiler. Here it is in three rather messy steps. But beware: the installs may go through, but most of the compiler versions throw a variety of errors. I have found an interesting blog [https://blog.curvegrid.com/daysofblock/2017/05/12/daysofblock-02-solc-versions.html](url) that suggest that building from source in the end is easier :-(

(1) To deal with the "ChecksumMismatchError: SHA256 mismatch" error, disable the checksum verification as described above.

(2) To deal with the "/bin/sh: ccache: command not found" error, one has to include "/usr/local/bin" in the PATH. The instructions [https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ](url) suggest the following:

`$ sudo launchctl config system path /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`
Then reboot, and check:
```
$ launchctl getenv PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```
Indeed /usr/local/bin appears in the PATH, but the "/bin/sh: ccache: command not found"  persists. I am wondering whether the FAQ is wrong?
In the end I added a link to ccache in a directory that did get included in the PATH:
```
$ cd /usr/local/opt/cmake/bin
$ ln ../../../bin/ccache
```

(3) Then another error appeared:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "Json::Value::append(Json::Value&&)", referenced from:
      dev::eth::Assembly::streamAsmJson(std::__1::basic_ostream<char,
```
To fix this, a tip from [https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/issues/164](url) helped:
`$ brew uninstall --ignore-dependencies jsoncpp`

Finally all v0.4.x installs went trough, as shown below. It took several hours to do all the installs.

Hi @pieterhartel , thanks for the workaround, hopefully it will help folks with the same problem.
It seems like it worked for you in the end, so can we close the issue?

There was a bug in cmake with homebrew and it always detected it, but didn't pick it up properly.

I suggest to install it outside of homebrew.

Yes, this was another bug in our cmake.

Is it worth mentioning these in the documentation? I think. @ChrisChinchilla what do you think?

@ChrisChinchilla There was another report coming in today: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5449. I have the feeling that we should mention them in the documentation and provide this and hopefully a workaround for the other issue.

@hadv @purbanow @pieterhartel  Yes, we have a Homebrew experiment in progress here - https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/pull/212

But it is basically wrapping just building from particular version releases, so in the meantime continuing to do that is the best solution.

It will take me a little time to create a formula for each version and test each one to update dependencies etc (especially as its hard to get macOS in VMs) so bear with me. But you can see the general principles in that PR and contributions to help build that library of formulae are welcome.
