Hi @lazaridiscom . Many thanks for this ticket. However, after having read both, this and your reference ticket, I actually do believe this is a duplicate of the original ticket, just stating the way "how to do" instead of "what to do", which I believe, is up to the implementer fulfilling this ticket.

Are you fine with closing this ticket and just moving the communication back to the original?
