# [\#5217 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5217) `closed`: Yul: block flattening pass

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=3e46099035fcc96e01be5297c24450bf40d92134&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-10-15 09:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5217):

Implement a YUL AST pass that flattens all blocks, in the sense that a block is replaced by its statements if the block is a regular statement inside another block.
This requires the disambiguator to have been run before (to avoid name conflicts).

NB: the blocks did exist to quickly deallocate stack slots for variables at the end of a block. That won't be needed in the future anymore, as the stack slot allocator will be handling this case in the future.

### Input:
```
let x
{
    x := rhs
}
```

### expected output:
```
let x
x := rhs
```
