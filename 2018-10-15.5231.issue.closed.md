# [\#5231 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5231) `closed`: [Yul] Improve inlining heuristic

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-10-15 22:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5231):

The decision about when to inline a function depends both on the called function and on the call site. A small function should be more likely to be inlined while a function call where an argument is a constant should increase the factor even more.

Currently, the size of the function is calculated for each function call, it is probably better to cache these values.

Furthermore, since we use the expression breaker prior to function inlining, all function call parameters are variables. It might make sense to use the data flow analyzer to determine whether the current value of some of the parameters are constants.
