(from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5198#issuecomment-433001620 )

The purpose of asserts is to re-ensure any assumptions about data being handed between modules of the Solidity compiler. When a solAssert is triggered, it is always a compiler error and never a user error. in this case, `prepareMemoryStore` should never ever be called for a type that has zero bytes size. The actual condition to check that should be higher up in the compiler. If this check fails due to some reason (because someone changed the compiler code), we will not get a problem down here because of the assert. The compiler will exit with an error and hopefully prompt the user to report the problem with us, so we can fix the compiler.

Addition: We should always strive to reach the following situation: If the analysis phase resulted in no error, then the code generation phase should be able to generate code. This rule has an exception in unimplemented (and thus undocumented) features and some stack related exceptions. The latter will hopefully be gone soon once we implement the new code generator.
