Hi, all:

I really like the feature:
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

Can I use this feature so that I can return a struct?
When can I use this feature?

The compiler gives the warning. That mean I should only use it for development.
That makes no sense to me.

Warning: Experimental features are turned on. Do not use experimental features on live deployments.
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

The encoder should not cause any security issues (of course we can never be sure). The main reason it is marked experimental is because it causes higher gas usage.

except for high gas usage.  Is there another reason for not using pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2 for live development?
