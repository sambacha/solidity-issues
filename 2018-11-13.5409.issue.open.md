# [\#5409 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5409) `open`: [Yul] EVM codegen: Do not copy topmost stack element if this is the last use
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`

When a variable is referenced for the last time and is by chance at the top of the stack, do not copy it.
Another similar optimization: Swap the variable to the top of the stack if the top of the stack can be moved (i.e. was declared in the current scope).

The place to add this would be EVMCodeTransform.cpp:365. The stack height probably has to be adjusted manually (`m_stackAdjustment` has to be modified) and something similar to what is done inside `freeUnusedVariables` has to be done.
