In order to make sure that all the examples on https://ethereum.org are compiling, we could add them to our testing pipeline. The majority of them are already stored in separate files (the only exception is https://ethereum.org/greeter) and could be easily picked while running the external tests. 

Todo:
[ ] Move remaining examples from Markdown to separate files
[ ] Clone the ``ethereum-org`` repository and try to compile all contracts contained in ``/solidity``

Probably a good idea! We should also sync up with the people who are maintaining these tutorials (and check if such people actually exist :) ).

The website was replaced with a new one. Closing as it doesn't contain too many examples and is not centered around those.
