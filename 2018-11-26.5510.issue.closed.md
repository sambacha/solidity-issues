# [\#5510 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5510) `closed`: [Yul] Implement functions and code generator changes for yul objects

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-11-26 18:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5510):

This needs changes to `AbstractAssembly` to provide entry points for the Yul Object-specific built-in functions (we should also add the built-in functions to the set checked by the optimizer).

Scoping rules for accessing data: The name of the current object and all its direct sub-nodes are accessible. Everything else has to be reached via a `.`-separated path: `datasize("root.sub1.data2")`

Built-in functions:
 - `function dataoffset("name") -> offset`
 - `function datasize("name") -> size`
 - `function datacopy(to, from, size)`

This should also replace some of the functions in AbstractAssembly like `appendAssemblySize`
