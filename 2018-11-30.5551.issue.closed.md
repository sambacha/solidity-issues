## Description

Here's an example.

```
contract C {
	function literalToUFixed() public pure returns (ufixed8x2) {
		ufixed8x2 a = 0.10;
		return a;
	}
}
```

I expect `0.10` is implicitly convertible to `ufixed8x2`, but it doesn't.

```
Error: Type rational_const 1 / 10 is not implicitly convertible to expected type ufixed8x2. Try converting to type ufixed8x1 or use an explicit conversion.
		ufixed8x2 a = 0.10;
		^----------------^
```

The current implementation makes a pre-conversion from the rational number literal `1/10` to some random fixed-point type (here `ufixed8x1`) and checks if the type (`ufixed8x1`) can be implicitly convertible to the target type (`ufixed8x2`).

This behavior also causes literals being not convertible to any signed fixed-point types.

```
contract C {
	function literalToFixed() public pure returns (fixed8x1) {
		fixed8x1 a = 0.1;
		return a;
	}
}
```

Since `ufixed8x1` is not implicitly convertible to `fixed8x1, this does not compile.

```
Error: Type rational_const 1 / 10 is not implicitly convertible to expected type fixed8x1. Try converting to type ufixed8x1 or use an explicit conversion.
		fixed8x1 a = 0.1;
		^--------------^
```

## Environment

- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS

## Steps to Reproduce

See the above example.
