## Description

Hi, I would suggest that the error message for attempting to compile an abstract contract be improved.  When I attempted to compile a contract I had accidentally made abstract, I got an error message me telling me that the compiled contract was not found; I thought this was a bug in `solc` until I realized I had accidentally made my contract abstract!  An error message explicitly mentioning abstract contracts would be more helpful; then I would have known right away that there was an abstract contract involved.

Thank you!

@haltman-at Thanks for reporting this! I think we could probably warn about abstract contracts being used in the inheritance hierarchy. We would need to discuss that in more detail, though.

The main problem here is that there is no way to tell whether you actually want to compile the contract or if you just want to define it to be used as base contract. Currently, I only see something like an explict `abstract` keyword as a solution.

We have agreed on implementing #649 for the next breaking release. Closing this issue as it will be solved by that.
