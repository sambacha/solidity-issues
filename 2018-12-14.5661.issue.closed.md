# [\#5661 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5661) `closed`: Which pragma version for compiler 0.5.1+commit.c8a2cb62.Emscripten.clang

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32337870?v=4" width="50">[landedexperts](https://github.com/landedexperts) opened issue at [2018-12-14 01:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5661):

Hi,

I am trying to compile the following SC:
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.1

contract x {
	function f() {}
};
```
in JavaScript using the following code:
```
const fs = require("fs")
const solc = require("solc")

const source = fs.readFileSync('contract.sol', "utf8")

console.log(source)

const compiled = solc.compile(JSON.stringify({
	language: "Solidity",
	sources: {
		"contract.sol": {
			"content": source
		}
	},
	settings: {
		outputSelection: {
			"*": {
				"*": ["*"]
			}
		}
	}
}))

console.log(JSON.stringify(compiled))
```
in `package.json`, the versioning is `"solc": "^0.5.0"`, but I get the following error:
```
"{\"contracts\":{},\"errors\":[{\"component\":\"general\",\"formattedMessage\":\"contract.sol:1:1: SyntaxError: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.5.1+commit.c8a2cb62.Emscripten.clang - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version\\npragma solidity ^0.5.1\\r\\n^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple
lines).\\n\",\"message\":\"Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.5.1+commit.c8a2cb62.Emscripten.clang - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version\",\"severity\":\"error\",\"sourceLocation\":{\"end\":60,\"file\":\"contract.sol\",\"start\":0},\"type\":\"SyntaxError\"}],\"sources\":{}}"
```

So I tried each `<=`, `<`, `>`, `>=` combined with each `0.5.1` and `0.5.0` but the same error shows up.

So which pragma version to use?
My guess is that the error comes from somewhere else, but I have no clue where.
Can you help?

**Addendum**

I tried with version `0.5.0` and `0.5.1` of `solc` with same error, only the name of the commit in the error changes.

The issue occurs on Windows 10 with version `v10.13.0` of `node`, in a brand new node environment. Before having tested, I also have removed my global `node` modules by renaming the folder `node_modules`, to avoid any interference.

My bad, syntax errors in the Solidity code. Misplaced the semicolon. Sorry for the mistake.

As a remark, can the error messages be improved?
