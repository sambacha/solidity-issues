# [\#5715 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5715) `closed`: [Yul] Test case for switch and inlining

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-12-20 15:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5715):

We should have a test case in the `fullSuite` that shows that the following is properly reduced:
```
mstore(f(1), 0)
function f(x) -> y {
switch x
case 0 { y := 8 }
case 1 { y := 9
}
```

similar test cases can also be created using `if`, for example.

If this is not properly reduced, we have to extend the structural simplifier.
