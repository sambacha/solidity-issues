# [\#5825 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5825) `open`: Examine new Solidity fork called Lity

See https://github.com/CyberMiles/lity

They seem to have forked off after 0.4.24.

One of the differences:
> Unlike Solidity, which only supports integer math, the Lity language provides full support for fixed point real number arithmetic.

And they support that via new opcodes: https://github.com/CyberMiles/lity/commit/84d2a1b98c6a24137576883fe27906295d55790d

They also have a "rule engine": https://lity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rule-engine-guide.html

Which basically seems to be a definition of trigger catching and executing code on them.
