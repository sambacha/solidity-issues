Found by ossfuzz (12672).

```
src/solidity/build/deps/src/jsoncpp-project/src/lib_json/json_reader.cpp:1584:39: runtime error: negation of -9223372036854775808 cannot be represented in type 'Json::Value::LargestInt' (aka 'long'); cast to an unsigned type to negate this value to itself
```

Apparently this was also found by upstream and fixed there: https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/pull/856

However, there's no upstream release yet.
