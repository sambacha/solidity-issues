# [\#6013 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6013) `closed`: Implement YUL optimizer

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-02-14 18:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6013):

## Abstract

#3638 depends on this issue being fixed. ATM, differential fuzz testing cannot take place.

## Motivation

At the moment, invocation of yul optimization is forbidden through the command line by this line of code

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/690edc8bc9ca82602ec04590fe68251fc173fc41/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L868-L872

Furthermore, there is an assertion inside AssemblyStack, that reports yul optimization as unimplemented.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/690edc8bc9ca82602ec04590fe68251fc173fc41/libyul/AssemblyStack.cpp#L87

The problem with this is that the fuzzing code directly invokes AssemblyStack's optimize before obtaining a trace for the optimized code via the upcoming yul Interpreter.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/de7d4a8fc149f5b13f956ab745a880937988f869/test/tools/ossfuzz/strictasm_opt_ossfuzz.cpp#L97

Therefore, unless the `solUnimplmented` line inside AssemblyStack is removed (i.e., yul optimization is implemented), we cannot differentially fuzz test the yul optimizer.

Closing issue since I should have been differentially testing the **StrictAssembly** optimizer and not Yul.
