# [\#6178 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6178) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Pointers: erase knowledge only about assigned index

When a mapping/array index is assigned, all knowledge about variables of the same type are erased. We could erase knowledge only about the assigned index.

Example:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
  
contract C {
    uint[] a;
    uint[][] b;
    function f(uint x) public {
        uint[] storage s = b[5];
        a[0] = x;
        s[1] = 2;
        assert(a[0] == x);
    }
}
```
Even though `s` could be pointing to `a`, assigning `s[1]` shouldn't change `a[0]`.
Currently the assertion is reported as false, but it should be safe.

This seems to be working already for `delete`.

This would be too complicated to implement for the value it adds. We're better off actually implementing full aliasing support.
Closing in favor of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9148.
