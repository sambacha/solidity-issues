# [\#6271 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6271) `closed`: Invalid opcode 1b

## Description
I'm using ethereumJ to run my tests but I compile the contract with solc directly.

Until solc 0.5.4, everything was working fine. Since I've upgraded to 0.5.5, I'm getting this error:
:Invalid operation code: opCode[1c]; (in another project, I get an error about the opcode 1b)

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.5
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): ^0.5.0
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): ethereumj
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ethereumj
- Operating system: Linux / OSX

## Steps to Reproduce
you can run the tests at http://github.com/adridadou/eth-propeller-core to reproduce the errors
I get this error for any call I'm making actually. I see that the errors are for things as simple as 
```
function addressFunc(address addr)  public pure  returns (address) {
     return addr;
}
```

Happy to give further info if needed. Maybe it's a bug on my side but I don't understand what has changed between 0.5.4 and 0.5.5

I think I found the issue. They seem to be constantinople opcodes but ethereumj doesn't enable them for some reason
