# [\#6299 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6299) `open`: Still misleading error messages for external function calls.
**Labels**: `good first issue`

The fix of #4307 is somewhat incomplete.

```
contract c {
    function f1() external returns (uint) {}
    // function f2() external returns (uint) {}
    function g() public { f1(); }
}
```
nicely yields (could still be improved, but fine)
```
DeclarationError: Undeclared identifier. "f1" is not (or not yet) visible at this point.
    function g() public { f1(); }
                          ^^
```

On the other hand, the following:
```
contract c {
    function f1() external returns (uint) {}
    function f2() external returns (uint) {}
    function g() public { f1(); }
}
```
yields
```
browser/Untitled.sol:6:27: DeclarationError: Undeclared identifier. Did you mean "f1" or "f2"?
    function g() public { f1(); }
                          ^^
```
Which is pretty weird - before searching for similar identifiers here, we should check whether there is an external function with exactly the same name. Also should "f1" and "f2" (since they are external) in fact be considered viable suggestions here?

In any case: not sure whether there's a duplicate for this, but it may be worth to improve all this somewhat more.

A simple solution might be to just add ``this.`` to the suggestions, if the type is an external function type. Might be better to distinguish between internal and external types for choosing suggestions in general, though.
