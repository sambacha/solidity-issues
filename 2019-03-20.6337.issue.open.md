# [\#6337 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6337) `open`: AbiEncoderv2 default getter return types

With the AbiEncoderv2, is the intent to have structs returned from auto-generated getters for public storage?

For example,

```
struct Data {
    uint256 x;
    bytes32 y;
}

mapping (bytes32 => Data) public data;
```

This exposes the getter `function data(bytes32) public view returns (uint256,bytes32)`

Is it possible that it could instead expose `function data(bytes32) public view returns (Data)`?

I think you can not only get a struct type from a function with the [ABIEncoderV2](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/abi-spec.html#handling-tuple-types), but pass a struct type into a function.

The automatic getters were designed before structs in the ABI were even considered. Especially for arrays, getters as they currently are make sense in certain cases, so I'm a bit reluctant in changing the behaviour altogether. We could change the detail about returning structs once ABIEncoderV2 is the default, though. I would not change it earlier because activating ABIEncoderV2 currently does not silently change the external behaviour of contracts.
