This is a commandline test:
```
Incorrect output on stderr received. Expected:
Exception while assembling:
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<yul::StackTooDeepError>
std::exception::what: Variable a1 is 17 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
[dev::tag_comment*] = Variable a1 is 17 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
But got:
Exception while assembling:
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<yul::StackTooDeepError>
std::exception::what: Variable a1 is 17 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
[dev::tag_comment*] = Variable a1 is 17 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
```
Proposed fix: clean everything after `Dynamic exception type` before comparing.
