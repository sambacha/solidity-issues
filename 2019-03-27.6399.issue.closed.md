# [\#6399 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6399) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Support inheritance

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2019-03-27 15:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6399):

This includes
- `visit(ContractDefinition)` should also visit all public functions of base contracts that are not overridden;
- calls to functions from base classes that are not overridden should be inlined
- since the SMTChecker simulates execution paths, there's no need to start from internal functions.
- visit state vars of base contracts #6562 

Hint: check function `resolveVirtualFunction`

Test case:
```
contract A {
  function f() public { assert(g() == 1); }
  function g() internal returns (uint) { return 1; }
}
contract B is A { function g() internal returns (uint) { return 2; } }
```
