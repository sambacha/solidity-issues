## Abstract

The yul proto spec does not define the following opcodes yet

| opcode  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| calldataload(p)  |	call data starting from position p (32 bytes) |
| calldatasize	|	size of call data in bytes |
| calldatacopy(t, f, s) |	copy s bytes from calldata at position f to mem at position t |
| codesize	|	size of the code of the current contract / execution context |
| codecopy(t, f, s)	|	copy s bytes from code at position f to mem at position t |
| extcodesize(a)	|	size of the code at address a |
| extcodecopy(a, t, f, s)	|	like codecopy(t, f, s) but take code at address a |
| returndatasize	 |	size of the last returndata |
| returndatacopy(t, f, s)	|	copy s bytes from returndata at position f to mem at position t |
| extcodehash(a)  |	code hash of address a |

All of them have a side-effect (extend the trace) but the following ops (as implemented in the yul Interpreter) are just stubs that return hard-coded values: `extcodesize` and `extcodehash`. Nonetheless, it will still be interesting to automatically generate them.

## Specification

TBD
