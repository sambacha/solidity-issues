# [\#6469 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6469) `closed`: [yul interpreter] Implement memory/storage representation with holes

## Abstract

We use a vector to represent EVM memory/storage. Sparse memory stores blow up the size of the vector and make it's printing slow.

Example

```
{ mstore(67889, 1) }
```

resizes the vector to over 64 KB and stores a "1".

When we are printing the contents of memory (main use case being checking equivalence while fuzz testing), this becomes too slow.

## Motivation

TBD

## Specification

TBD

Maybe we should use some sort of paging? E.g. allocate fixed-size 4K blocks (or smaller) of memory and store them in a map...

Or just use a `std::map`? One problem might be overlapping mload/mstore operations, but I'm actually not sure that is implemented correctly at the moment.
