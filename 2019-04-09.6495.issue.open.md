# [\#6495 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6495) `open`: [Yul] Assert that AST is still valid every time after applying optimizer component
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `optimizer`

In `libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp`, we might want to do some "sanity check" every time after applying an optimizer component to AST.

By doing this we can ensure that every AST transformation is valid when running `solc`.

(Inspired by #6492)

Won't such a sanity check involve parsing the AST after each step, which is expensive? We could probably use this piece of code

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/bf653b004eb1168ac84a7c0532ba9ea66c415d0b/test/tools/yulopti.cpp#L89-L114

in here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/bf653b004eb1168ac84a7c0532ba9ea66c415d0b/test/libyul/YulOptimizerTest.cpp#L71

and then add

```
if (!parse(m_obtainedResult))
  return false;
```

here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/bf653b004eb1168ac84a7c0532ba9ea66c415d0b/test/libyul/YulOptimizerTest.cpp#L274

What do you think?

P.S. Probably better to add an additional method such as `YulOptimizerTest::parseObtainedResult` that looks very much like `YulOptimizerTest::parse` with `s/m_source/m_obtainedResult/` and minus the assignment of resulting ast to private members.

P.P.S. Doing sanity checking inside YulOptimizerTests is redundant because if a test input results in unparseable AST post optimization, it is going to fail that test (assuming the expectation is correctly encoded which is fair) regardless.

I think parsing is not really required, because we perform optimizer steps based on its memory representation. So I think the checks we can do would be those performed by the AsmAnalyzer.

I would assume that the checks are optional and only performed e.g. during fuzzer runs, right?

@bshastry Sorry for the late reply. Yes it is expensive but probably worth it? Typically smart contracts are `< 1000` lines so the overhead should not be noticeable from the user side.

@chriseth I agree. Using `AsmAnalyzer` makes sense.

At minimum we should do this sanity check when fuzzing. Not sure if we should turn on the check by default though..
