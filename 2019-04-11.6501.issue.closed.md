Contract [ChannelManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf2aeab03b82c182599930217272ef0fc5cf662b#code) has compiler meta-data that does not conform to the [specs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.7/metadata.html?highlight=bzzr). There are 306 bytes at the end of the bytecode that do not begin with `a165` but with `a265`. What does this mean? If this is an undocumented feature? Some documentation would be appropriate.

Here are the 306 bytes:

Thanks for notifying! Indeed, we extended the CBOR mapping a little. The documentation says that you should take a look at the last two bytes, interpret them as a byte length and track back. Then just CBOR-decode the data you found - so the metadata parsers should actually not be made that restrictive.

We should update the documentation to explain the new fields we added and perhaps also explain that new fields might be added any time without prior warning - those fields should be ignored by the parsers. @axic

@chriseth thanks for your answer. In the example of the ChannelManager, one first has to remove the constructor arguments, then find the `0037` hex = 55 decimal, and then track back 55 bytes to the `a265`. An update of the documentation would be welcome!
