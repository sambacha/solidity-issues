# [\#6522 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6522) `closed`: Accessing constants in pure functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28443115?v=4" width="50">[RenanSouza2](https://github.com/RenanSouza2) opened issue at [2019-04-15 20:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6522):

## Abstract

Make possible to access constants in pure functions

## Motivation

Pure functions cannot access environment variables, but constants are decided in compile time.


## Backwards Compatibility

If the function is pure bute call calls an old contract view function, being this view only due to a constant access, the new function needs to also be view

Can you give some example code, please?

```
    contract SomeContract {
        uint256 constant public ID = 0;
    }
```

```    

    contract Test {
        SomeContract public some;
        
        function setSome (address _some)
        external {
            some = SomeContract(_some);
        }
        
        function getID ()
        external view returns (uint256) {
            return some.ID();
        }
    }
```

Shouldn't the getID() be pure as the ID cannot be changed

This is a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1290 - I actually thought that was already implemented.
