## Description

I'm following the instructions on the [latest docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) to build from source with the SMTChecker. The build is failing with the following error:

```

Here's the full output of running `mkdir build`, `cd build`, and `cmake .. && make` https://gist.github.com/maurelian/d728873ad9590818352608797e7a4bb3

What version of z3 you have installed and where?

```
$ which -as z3
/home/primary/.pyenv/shims/z3
/usr/bin/z3

$ z3 --version
Z3 version 4.8.4 - 64 bit
```

That pyenv shim might be messing stuff up... though I can clearly still call z3 from the command line?

That was it. 
Ensuring that `which z3` returns `/usr/bin/z3` solved my problem.
