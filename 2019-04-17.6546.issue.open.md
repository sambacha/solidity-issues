Create a CircleCI job that runs once a day and tests for memory leaks.

### Open questions
* Only for branch develop?
* Or for develop and/or a special branch that people can merge their work to in order to get it checked.

### Motivation
Memory leaks and address issues should be caught early. (But checking upon every PR push is probably exploding CPU cycles too much).
