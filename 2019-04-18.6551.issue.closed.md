# [\#6551 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6551) `closed`: [Yul] Arithmetic operations overflow checking

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757200?v=4" width="50">[totoroXD](https://github.com/totoroXD) opened issue at [2019-04-18 11:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6551):

## Description

Does Yul specification define that arithmetic operation should check overflow?
According to Yul documentation, I only see overflow checking in type conversion functions.

The Solidity -> Yul translation is still work in progress and highly experimental. There is no specification.

Which Yul documentation do you refer to?

https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/yul.html

Is there any better document to see decided specifications?
I want to implement those arithmetic operations.

@totoroXD in that case this would rather need to be in the Solidity spec, since it's Solidity compilation to Yul that is doing the overflow checks. The Yul operations themselves are still unchecked in that case.

@leonardoalt Yes, you are correct, and my question was misleading. This should only be implementation issue. Thanks.
In Solidity, overflow checking is specified by safemath; then I think this piece of code needs revision.
