# [\#6572 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6572) `closed`: Address Payable Conversion

Currently the way to convert an `address` to a `payable` one. Is by using `address(uint160(addr))`.

This is a ugly and not understandable on first sight. It would be ideal if there was a nicer way to do this conversion.

We are currently thinking about a way of doing that without looking even uglier or more confusing.

One idea was
`address payable a = payable(addr);`

@leonardoalt I think the above solution is definitely better than what we currently have.

I run into the same issue.
Great to see we both came up with the same solution.

If we decide to implement this, we need to define the rules for `payable(x)` and `address(x)`.
Currently, `address(x)` returns `address payable` if `x` is payable, otherwise `address`.
This would overlap with the new `payable(x)` which always returns `address payable`.

Also, there are tricky situations, for example with `this`. If `this` does not have a fallback function, should `payable(this)` issue a compilation error? Should it give an `address payable` anyway?

Regarding the overlap between `address(x)` and `payable(x)`, do we keep this overlap, or do we make `address(x)` always return only `address`?

This needs to be well specified. After talking to @ekpyron yesterday I'm again not sure this is a good idea at all.

A cast of the form ``payable(x)`` seems weird to me, whenever ``x`` is not an address - but if we move away from having the result type of ``address(x)`` depend on ``x``, we'd probably need ``payable(x)`` for integers and contracts...
Also to me it seems having ``payable(this)`` silently return an ``address payable`` kind of defeats the entire purpose of splitting ``address`` - so I'd at least require ``payable(address(this))`` in that case...
But yeah, I'm not sure about the entire thing myself anymore either.

*If* we still want to do this and *if* we're fine with ``payable(x)`` for ``uint160 x;``, then I'd specify as:
- ``address(x)`` always returns ``address``, i.e. it's just the explicit conversion to ``address``
- ``payable(x)`` always returns ``address payable``, i.e. it's just the explicit conversion to ``address payable``
- Contracts with payable fallback are explicitly convertible to both ``address`` and ``address payable``
- Contracts without payable fallback are explicitly convertible to ``address`` only
- ``address`` is explicitly convertible to ``address payable``
- ``address payable`` is implicitly convertible to ``address`` as before
- ``uint160`` is explicitly convertible to both ``address`` and ``address payable`` (and vice versa)

An alternative would be to continue to let ``address(x)``'s return type depend on ``x`` and only allow ``payable(x)`` for ``address x;`` - but that seems quite weird to me.

Given ``payable(x)`` for ``uint160 x;`` I'm not sure anymore whether ``address payable(x)`` might - although weird as well - still be the better alternative to ``payable(x)`` in general.

So yeah, that'd be my current stand on this, but more opinions would be really good...

I think requiring the argument of `payable` to be an `address` is not too bad.

I would prefer to only allow `payable(x)` if `x` is an address. `address(x)` returns an address or an address payable depending on x.

Yeah ok, if you both agree on that, I'm fine with it.

It's just quite different from other types and their conversions that way (and if we have explicit casts for ``address`` and ``address payable``, then there's less pressing need for all these exceptions than before), but maybe that's just how it is.
