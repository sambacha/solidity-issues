# [\#6613 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6613) `closed`: [ossfuzz] nightly CI times out because of no console output for over 10 minutes

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-04-29 12:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6613):

## Description

Each fuzzer that is part of the nightly CI runs thousands of regression tests which, in one case, (unoptimized solc invocation) can take over 10 minutes to complete.

CircleCI times out such runs because it does not witness any output on the console.

Proposed solution: Print a "dot" every 5 minutes so as to not trigger a circle CI timeout.
