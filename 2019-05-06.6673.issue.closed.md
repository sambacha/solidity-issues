# [\#6673 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6673) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Do not add assertion condition after check

Currently every assertion is added as a constraint after its check. For inconsistent cases this leads to every following query to be UNSAT.
We should add the assertion as a constraint only if the solver returns `unknown`.
