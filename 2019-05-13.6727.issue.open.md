# [\#6727 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6727) `open`: [YulOpt] Memory and Storage awareness
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`

The optimizer should know about memory and storage in a similar way that the DataFlowAnalyzer does:

Memory is zero-initialized, but storage is unknown.

Operations like `mstore(x, y)` note that the value of variable `y` is stored at point `x` (symbolically). Whenever the value of `x` or `y` changes (or one of their referenced variables), the knowledge is erased. Also, `mstore` erases knowledge of all other memory locations `t`, where `sub(x, t)` is not known to be less than -31 or at least 32. For storage, they only have to be different.

At joining control flows, knowledge is combined.

If an `sload(x)` or `mload(x)` is encountered, where the value at point `x` in storage / memory is known, it is replaced by that value. This is similar to the CommonSubexpressionEliminator, but for storage / memory.

Actually we do not need to erase the knowledge if a variable referenced by `x` changes, only if the variable `x` itself changes. So the strategy should be as follows:

While traversing the AST we keep information about the value of `sload(x)` and `mload(x)` in a similar way to the DataFlowAnalyzer (probably we just extend the class):

`sstore(x, y)` stores `STORAGE: x -> y`, but only if `x` and `y` are actual variables. Otherwise, storage (maybe only at `x`) is deleted.

Any operation that modifies storage clears knowledge (maybe only a part)

Any operation that changes the value of `x` or `y` also clears that information (but only that one).

At control-flow joins, any storage information that has been deleted in one branch is deleted in the join. If `x` or `y` has been changed in any of the branches, `STORAGE: x -> y` is cleared in the join.

Awareness is implemented in the LoadResolver. What we still need to implement is the fact that memory is zero initially.
