# [\#6728 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6728) `open`: [YulOpt] Redundant Store Elimination
**Labels**: `feature`, `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-05-13 07:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6728):

This optimizer step is the equivalent of the RedundantAssignEliminator, but for storage and memory. It could use https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6727 as a dependency.

Since the RedundantAssignEliminator does not use the DataFlowAnalyzer, we could also make it a little easier, though: Eliminate two stores if they store at the same symbolic location, i.e. variable, and that variable has not been reset in the meantime.
