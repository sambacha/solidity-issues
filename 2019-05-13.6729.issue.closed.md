## Abstract

<!--
Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.
-->

We currently have a hard-coded for loop template that looks like so

```
for { let i := 0 } lt(i,0x60) {i := add(i,0x20)}
{ <for-body>}
```

This issue tracks support for something more generic like so
```
for { <for-init-statements>} <for-cond> {<for-post-statements>}
{ <for-body>}
```

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

For loop init/post statements cannot include `break` and `continue`. Moreover, we exclude variable declarations from for-loop-init block to side step scope extension tracking logic in the proto fuzzer. This can be added later on.

Otherwise, the implementation logic is quite straightforward.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->

NA.
