In yul, sub-objects of objects should be accessible via `.`, but they are not.

If I recall correctly, this is the example here:
```
object "A" {
  code {
    pop(dataoffset("A")) // works
    pop(dataoffset("B")) // works
    pop(dataoffset("A.B")) // fails, but should work
  }
  
  object "B" {
    code {
      invalid()
    }
  }
}
```

```
Error: Unknown data object "A.B".

This will be needed to implement ``type(C).runtimeCode`` (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8867#discussion_r421843356).

Can be solved by adding names like `objectName.subObject` to `dataNames` for Object in `libYul/Object.cpp`
Not sure if this would be proper solution?

Or better option to parse and search for subobjects in `AsmAnalysis.cpp`

Both adding ``objectName.subObject`` to ``dataNames`` (i.e. to the "global scope" IIUC) and descending into objects when searching sounds viable.
But note that this needs to be recursive (at least I'd make it so), i.e. ``objectName.subObject.subSubObject`` has to work as well - and we need to make sure there are no conflicts, e.g. the following currently compiles:
```
object "obj" {
        code {
        }
        object "subobj" {
                code {
                }
                object "subsubobj" {
                        code {
                        }
                }
        }
        object "subobj.subsubobj" {
                code {
                }
        }
}
```
Maybe dots ``.`` should not be allowed in names of yul objects (ping @chriseth)? Or should ``subobj.subsubobj`` just conflict with the inner ``subsubobj`` of the other ``subobj``?

It makes sense to disallow dots in yul object names.

By the way, do we know if this will work in the end? Can we reach deep into Assembly objects like that?

We can't go deep into Assembly objects, it just can take direct subobjects.

@axic Does it makes sense to implement `A.B` at all in cases like this. I think it is not needed, and we need to implement `B.C` (if B had subobject C) like done in #8967 in test `subObjectAccess.yul`?

@mijovic Sorry missed the question. Do you mean that the path should always be relative to the current object
a) and not be an absolute path
b) not include the object itself

I agree with a), but not sure about b).

@ekpyron @chriseth any opinions?

What is easier for the code generator? Having to use `A.` all the time seems a bit redundant.

I would allow from user side to do `A.`, but internally would use it as relative path without object itself, in this case `A.`

Is this fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9235 ?
