# [\#6828 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6828) `closed`: [Yul] Helper function to create special numbers

We have a lot of code that uses expressions like `(u256(1) << _bits) - 1`. There should be helper functions to generate the largest and smallest numbers of the various signed and unsigned types.

Is this is a code-generator feature or a language feature? Are talking about introducing min/max basically for types? (#8484)

No, this is about internal functions for yul codegen. I'll close it.
