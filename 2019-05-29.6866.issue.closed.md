## Description

```
{
let a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3
function foo_noreturn_0()
{
let x_0
extcodecopy(foo_singlereturn_0(foo_singlereturn_0(foo_singlereturn_0(foo_singlereturn_0(1, foo_singlereturn_0(foo_singlereturn_0(codesize(), 1, 1, 1), 1, 1, 1), 1, 1), 1, 1, 1), 1, 1, 1), 1, 1, 1), 1, 1, 1)
}
foo_noreturn_0()
function foo_singlereturn_0(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) -> x_4
{
x_4 := addmod(addmod(addmod(x_0, x_0, x_0), x_0, x_0), x_0, x_1)
}
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

This looks suspiciously similar to the other issue we had some weeks ago...

And it can probably be solved by not inlining functions that are indirectly recursive...

Do we want to flag bugs like this in the future? If not, I can look into limiting recursion depth of protobuf

In this specific example, multiple `x_0` were replaced by the same expression, so the program need to compute that same expression 6 times.

I think the solution is to avoid application of `ExpressionInliner` when it will duplicate expressions? (not necessarily recursive) i.e only apply `ExpressionInliner` when the argument is a Literal/Identifier or the argument only appears once in the expression.

Actually, is there a case that `ExpressionInliner` must be used? Seems like expression splitter + function inliner + expression joiner can reach the same effect?

Indeed, the expression inliner may be redundant since we now have the step that modifies for loops to pull out the condition.
Still, the expression inliner could be a useful shortcut. It currently does not have a heuristic, which we should add. Duplicating expressions should be avoided, as you said, but it is not a problem if the function call argument is itself a variable.
