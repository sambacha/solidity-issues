## Description

I have written a contract with the hub/factory pattern in which I need to capture the address of the contract that is being created, for this I am using events.

Contract A
- Function A1
-- Call to Function B1
--- emit event

Contract B
- Function B1
-- Actions

However, I try making an event with a single contract and it works perfectly, I receive the receipt with the associated events and the resulting elements.

I uploaded to my repository the code I'm using, the contract in question is as follows

https://github.com/DanielZambranoC/Capachain/blob/master/bc/contracts/Capachain.sol

As you can see in line 11 I have changed the content of the event to 'daniel' proving that it was not a problem with the address I was sending, basically I need to return the contract address that was created to the front end to notify the user. 

I am using web3js in its version 1.0.0 beta 36 and 55 with my application

In Remix I can see that the *log* returns the events raised, but I have not managed to capture them from my application.

In the test with only 1 contract you can see that I have the key/value structure of the event, name with their respective values.

In the test with the hub/factory contracts you can see what comes if the events, if I send 2, send me 2 arrays but without content but with raw data, I think that if I sent 100 events, they would sell the 100 array but without information.

## Result with 1 Contract

Hi @DanielZambranoC , can you please also provide the code that does not work for you?

I tried your code on Remix changing the first emit to `emit RegistroQueja(contrato);` and the second to `emit RegistroQuejaXXXX(nuevaQueja);`. It works fine as you can see (I called function `registrarQueja` with arguments `desc`, `name`, `n`, `c`):
```

Also please note that emitting an event with a struct as a parameter requires `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2` which I did use in the test above.
