The "Building from Source" part of the "Installing Solidity" documentation does not mention the minimal compiler versions we require.

We can't just add it to the list, since people may choose different compilers on various systems (e.g. clang or gcc on linux). So we should probably add another subsection dedicated to compiler versions stating that the user needs *one* of them and states the minimal version for each option.

I think the minimal versions are GCC 5.0 and clang 3.4. For MSVC I think it's MSVC 2017.
