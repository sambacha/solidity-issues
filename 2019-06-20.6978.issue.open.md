# [\#6978 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6978) `open`: Specification of ABI decoding (especially padding in bytes)
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-06-20 18:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6978):

According to the doc:
```
bytes, of length k (which is assumed to be of type uint256):

enc(X) = enc(k) pad_right(X), i.e. the number of bytes is encoded as a uint256 followed by the actual value of X as a byte sequence, followed by the minimum number of zero-bytes such that len(enc(X)) is a multiple of 32.
```

But currently some semantic tests do not pad zeros, ex. 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/91a2a9a9c3cc46b7ef199c2691f06bfcbcda5203/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/abiEncoderV2/calldata_array_dynamic_index_access.sol#L33

I wonder if both ways of encoding are acceptable?

I'm pretty sure that the `left` function here does pad to 32 bytes. Also the `96` shows you that `abi.encode` does perform padding.

But the input is not padded. If I understand these semantic tests correctly, the input should follow the ABI specification

Ah, sorry, now I see what you mean!
We could check the padding in the decoder, but it might be a little difficult to do that. In general, the decoder does not require this padding (I hope).

I just noticed that the following link says "representations without minimal offset possible" are allowed currently because the decoder simply follows tail pointers.

https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.9/abi-spec.html#strict-encoding-mode

The real question is, whether a "Solidity ABI compatible" decoder need to be able to decode byte arrays that have no paddings. If yes, the document should mention that padding is optional.

Personally I would say yes because padding to 32 bytes doesn't make sense when we switch to eWasm. (and we may want to change the encoding spec due to this)

The problem is that the documentation only fully specifies an encoder, but not a decoder.

Perhaps a decoder (which simply follows tail pointer) should be specified instead of an encoder? To allow multiple legal binary representations.

As an update: a decoder will in fact accept ``bytes`` arrays that are not padded and we decided to keep it like that (but to require padding for all value types). What we need is a proper documentation of all this, i.e. a full specification of our decoder in the docs.

For reference and related to this: there is work being done towards an Isabelle specification of ABI decoding and encoding in https://github.com/mmalvarez/Yul-Isabelle/blob/master/AbiTypes.thy .
