Closing since https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7010 showed that evmone creates a tremendous increase in execution speed and might also reduce dependencies. We should not have evmone and aleth in parallel, in my opinion, since it would complicate testing dependencies. Also, the gas values and some other aspects still need some tweaking. Because of that, I would propose to complete it in the next iteration.
