# [\#7045 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7045) `closed`: Add checksum encoding utility function to be used by test code

## Abstract

Specific use-case fuzz testing, but this may apply to semantic tests as well CC @erak @chriseth 

Creating a test program with a valid `address` type value requires that the value be [checksum encoded](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55)

This issue tracks support for the checksum encoding function as part of solidity utilities (perhaps libdevcore).

This is exactly what I wanted to use. Closing issue
