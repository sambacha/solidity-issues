# [\#7082 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7082) `closed`: [semantic test] Report concrete reason of invalid encoding to user
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

When I was adding new semantic tests, I tried to add a test case that contains `0x140` (which is an illegal literal because hex number needs to have even length, for some reason), and the test framework just says `Literal encoding invalid.`, which is not very helpful and confuses me.

It could be useful if it prints more concrete reasons. Also seems like `TestFileParser::parseABITypeLiteral()` is not properly passing (rethrow) error reason to caller?

I can try to fix this when I get time.

@sifmelcara I started fixing this and some other issues with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7052. Please feel free to comment :)

I also created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7091 which fixes this issue.
