I checked the relevant image and it has 16 layers and a size of 1.86 GB.
I think I can reduce it to 9 layers and 1.82 GB..

It still takes 34 seconds to spin up the circleci environment. Maybe this could be improved?
The dockerfile is at `.circleci/docker/Dockerfile`

@chriseth Can you assign this to me? I'm willing to work on this :)

Thanks, please go ahead!

This issue seems to be not relevant anymore as the files in `scripts/docker` do not seem to have many layers (a few `RUN` and `COPY` instructions). Is this relevant @chriseth @aarlt @ekpyron @cameel, given you have touched docker stuff.

I don't think there's much we can improve here regarding the spin up time. I just took a look at the container download step in a random PR and the time it takes varies a lot even when the same exact image is being pulled:

- [b_ubu_static](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/9706/workflows/cf1340e3-a445-4952-9896-b2d3bb8a8fb5/jobs/484446): 13 seconds
    ```
      pull stats: download 299MiB in 3.65s (81.9MiB/s), extract 298.8MiB in 9.56s (31.25MiB/s)
      time to create container: 93ms
      using image solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps@sha256:aeedbe7390a7383815f0cf0f8a1b8bf84dc5e334a3b0043ebcdf8b1bdbe80a81
    Time to upload agent and config: 746.624244ms
    Time to start containers: 2.080314423s
    ```
- [b_ubu_release](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/9706/workflows/cf1340e3-a445-4952-9896-b2d3bb8a8fb5/jobs/484450): 45 seconds
    ```
      pull stats: download 241.7MiB in 2.563s (94.28MiB/s), extract 298.8MiB in 32.207s (9.277MiB/s)
      time to create container: 10.467s
      using image solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps@sha256:aeedbe7390a7383815f0cf0f8a1b8bf84dc5e334a3b0043ebcdf8b1bdbe80a81
    Time to upload agent and config: 849.954549ms
    Time to start containers: 1.174418413s
    ```

Both are running on identical machines (`Docker X-Large` instance) and the log shows that the exact same layers were downloaded vs already available locally. Despite this they downloaded different amounts of data (240 MB vs 300 MB), at different speeds (31 MiB/s vs 9 MiB/s) and the time to start the container differs by two orders of magnitude (0.1 s vs 10 s).

I think that the image is already optimized enough and other factors we don't have control over have much bigger influence now.

I think that is a reasonable number of layers, comparing to the issue opener. I take the liberty to close this, but @chriseth please reopen if you think otherwise.
