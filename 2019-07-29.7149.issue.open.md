# [\#7149 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7149) `open`: address payable as mapping type's key

## Abstract

Currently `mapping (address payable => uint256)` causes a parsing error:
```
ParserError: Expected '=>' but got 'payable'
mapping (address payable => uint) a;
^-----^
```

Is there any reason that this mapping type is not supported?

After reading https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4926#discussion_r216245203 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4926 in general it looks like it simply hasn't been implemented yet.
@chriseth @ekpyron ?

I'd ask the contrary: *should* this mapping type be supported? I think the original thought was, that it's not really useful, since ``address payable`` is implicitly convertible to ``address``, so you can always use an ``address payable`` as key in ``mapping (address => T)``, i.e. whenever you'd use ``mapping(address payable => T)`` you can just use ``mapping(address => T)`` instead. You'll never be able to call ``send`` or ``transfer`` on the keys in a mapping anyways.

Thinking about it, one might argue that it could be useful to explicitly restrict keys to only payable addresses, but is that really useful? So is it likely that one wants to have a mapping, such that ``m[a] = v`` is valid only if ``a`` is ``address payable``, but not if ``a`` is ``address``?

I agree that `mapping(address payable => T)` is not very useful.

The reason I encounter this issue is, I was upgrading a contract from 0.4.X to 0.5.X, and that contract uses `address` in a way that non-payable address type does not make much sense in the context (since the contract is all about sending money to people). In that case I would like to use `address payable` instead of `address` in mapping type's key, for the sake of consistency.
