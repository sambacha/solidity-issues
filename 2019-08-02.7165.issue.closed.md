# [\#7165 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7165) `closed`: [SMTChecker] StringLiteral causes type mismatch
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7011

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
  
contract C {
    function f(bytes32 _x) public pure {
        require(_x != "");
    }
}
```

StringLiterals are currently supported as Arrays, following `bytes`. Since StringLiterals can also be assigned/compared to `bytesNN` which is supported as `Int`, this causes a type mismatch inside the solver.
The fix for this involves a layer of type conversion for assignments similar to how it's done in codegen.
