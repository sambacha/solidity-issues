**Labels**: `enhancement`

## Abstract

Currently, the abiv2 proto fuzzer tests abi coding internally i.e., values passed to coding functions are obtained from within the contract storage/memory.

This issue tracks support for testing ABI coding inside a contract's constructor for which data must be obtained from an external source.

## Motivation

We need to
   - figure out a way to ABI encode the input to a contract's constructor
   - figure out what input signature the constructor expects
