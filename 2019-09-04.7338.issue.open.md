E.g. we currently have ``and(byte(x,y), 0xff) => byte(x,y)``, but we should also have
``and(0xff, byte(x,y)) => byte(x,y)``.
We could also have ``and(byte(x,y), C) => and(byte(x,y), and(C,0xFF))`` for constants ``C >= 256`` plus its symmetric counterpart.

Following @axic's chat suggestion we could also consider "``BYTE``-introduction-rules" like e.g.:

``and(shr(a*8,x),0xff) => byte(31-a,x)`` (need to recheck byte order, etc.!)
