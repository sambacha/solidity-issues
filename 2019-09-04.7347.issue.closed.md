## Abstract

Add the following opcodes to yul proto fuzzer
  - create
  - create2
  - call
  - callcode
  - delegatecall
  - staticcall

## Motivation

- create and create2 are one type of expressions that create a new contract and return its address
- the calls are another type of expression that call a function at a given address, returning 0 on error and 1 on success
