I would say it's quite natural for the pseudo-SSA... a "real" SSA would not assign to b in that if and instead have sth like let b_15 := phi(b, b_14) after the if instead - lacking such a phi function, assigning to b at the end of the if and having let b_15 := b afterwards seems like a good approximation to me - and given this, other optimizer components might be able to use "is real ssa variable" as well...
