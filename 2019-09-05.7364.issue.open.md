The compiler should auto-replace user-supplied revert strings by (short) identifiers and store the mapping in some metadata.

So this would happen whenever the revert message is a string literal? And could thereby be prevented by ``revert(string("msg"))``? Or whenever the argument can be compile-time evaluated in general? Or would this even be a new function ``revertFormat`` (given  #7365)?

It would be a compiler switch and yes, it could only be used for string literals.
