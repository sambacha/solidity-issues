# [\#7366 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7366) `closed`: Add support for macOS Catalina

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2019-09-06 03:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7366):

## Abstract
Currently, the [install_deps.sh](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/install_deps.sh) script does not support macOS Catalina. Although Catalina is still in beta, I made the mistake of installing my mac a few days ago. Thus, I cannot utilize the `install_deps.sh` script in projects like py-solc-x.

## Motivation

Reverting back to Mojave is a pain and lots of people will soon be upgrading to Catalina when it comes out of beta.

## Specification

It seems to be just a matter of adding a line to support Catalina here:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7dcc47ed57f5a6ea3761e54da5a4d7bbe055b5a7/scripts/install_deps.sh#L73-L98

I'd appreciate any feedback if you think there are other locations where this update needs to be applied.

## Backwards Compatibility

I don't think this will impact any previous versions.
