# [\#7403 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7403) `open`: [yul] CSE should be able to deal with mload
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-09-11 10:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7403):

We should be able to optimize
```
let a := calldataload(0)
let x := mload(a)
let z := mload(a)
sstore(0, sub(x, z))
```
into
```
sstore(0, 0)
```
but CSE cannot tell that `mload(a)` and `mload(a)` are the same (because it the expression is not movable).
