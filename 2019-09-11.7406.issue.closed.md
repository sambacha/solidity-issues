# [\#7406 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7406) `closed`: [Yul] for loop prettyfier

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-09-11 14:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7406):

If possible, at the end of optimization, for loop conditions should be pulled into the header.

```
for {} 1 {} {
   if iszero(x) { break }
   ...
}
```

should be transformed to

```
for {} x {} {
   ...
}
```

We may even add an `iszero` in the header if it is not present in the condition.

Variables that are declared before the loop and that are used inside but not after the loop could be pulled into the init part.

This is implemented in  #7409
