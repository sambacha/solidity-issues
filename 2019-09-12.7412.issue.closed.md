# [\#7412 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7412) `closed`: [ossfuzz] Use `-fsanitize=fuzzer` linker flag instead of linking to a custom built libFuzzingEngine.a

## Abstract

Currently, the fuzzing binaries link against a custom built `libFuzzingEngine.a` that is built in the ubuntu 19.04 docker image

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/324cc71b13a2e1ebf1fe34397d085832b89076a4/.circleci/docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu1904#L67-L75

ossfuzz guide suggests not doing this (see https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/832#issue-255774655)

The main motivation seems to be that coverage instrumentation flags for building libFuzzingEngine.a keep changing, so it's best to transparently use `-fsanitize=fuzzer` to use whatever instrumentation flags clang deems fit.

## Motivation

Essentially
  - remove `libFuzzingEngine.a` from the list of linked libraries from all fuzz targets
  - add a link flag `-fsanitize=fuzzer` for each of them


## Backwards Compatibility

NA. Once this is implemented, `libFuzzingEngine.a` may be removed from ubuntu19.04 docker image since it will no longer be used.

From [libfuzzer docs](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)

> Recent versions of Clang (starting from 6.0) include libFuzzer, and no extra installation is necessary.

> If modifying CFLAGS of a large project, which also compiles executables requiring their own main symbol, it may be desirable to request just the instrumentation without linking:

> clang -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link mytarget.c

> Then libFuzzer can be linked to the desired driver by passing in -fsanitize=fuzzer during the linking stage.
