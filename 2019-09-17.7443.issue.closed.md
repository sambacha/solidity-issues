## Description

When I was reviewing test coverage, I found that some code snippets like the following

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/5859a69c449bf970392d792e39396467331b71ed/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1960-L1973

are not covered. In general, it would be great to cover these that in turn influence coverage inside code generation

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/5859a69c449bf970392d792e39396467331b71ed/liblangutil/EVMVersion.h#L82-L94

One suggestion to do this is to explicitly write to the "settings"->"evmVersion" field a randomly chosen evm version string from the list of supported evm versions until the current one.
