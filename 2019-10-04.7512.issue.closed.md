## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

The `solc` v0.5.11 that has been distributed widely does not appear to be the same version that is defined on the [solc-bin list.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt) 

The snap distribution and the docker image both appear to be running `0.5.11+commit.22be8592`, while the canonical version of `0.5.11` appears to be `0.5.11+commit.c082d0b4`

The [ReadTheDocs versions page](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/versions/) also seems to be based on `22be8592`

This discrepancy can become a problem because programmatic [etherscan contract verification via the api](https://etherscan.io/apis#contracts) relies on a compiler string matching one of the [entries](https://etherscan.io/solcversions) on the `solc-bin/bin/list.txt` source. A contract compiled on the command line using one of the distributed binaries version output would not match a compatible version and fail verification. 

I also noticed a similar discrepancy with `v0.5.9` and a few earlier versions. `v0.5.12 (7709ece9)` and `v0.5.10 (5a6ea5b1)` match as expected.

## Environment

- Compiler version: v0.5.11, v0.5.9, others
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Linux/OSX

Thanks for opening this issue! You are indeed right, the solc-js version seems to be behind by one commit. This commit is only a change in the build scripts, but we should still point solc-js at the proper tag.

Note that source verification has to fail anyway if you are not using exactly the same compiler because the metadata includes the commit and platform of the compiler and thus the metadata hash will be different.

FWIW, only the binary output needs to match to do source verification, since the service regenerates the artifacts on the other end from the source and compares the bin with the contract code on-chain. In this case, I was able to verify a contract compiled with `0.5.11+commit.22be8592` using solc.js `0.5.11+commit.c082d0b4`, probably because of the difference only being in the build scripts, but in the case of other compiler tag mismatches the bin may not match. 

We're trying to programatically verify on this end though by stripping the platform and sending the version off that way, etherscan bases their list of [supported compilers](https://etherscan.io/solcversions) on the js versions though.

@brianmcmichael etherscan does not do full source verification, it strips the metadata hash and only compares the opcodes. This is fine most of the time, but it can fool you with regards to variable names, comments and even worse: Code that uses codecopy to access the metadata hash.

My comment above is partly wrong, though, only the commit hash is part of the metadata, not the platform.

@ekpyron is this related to what you are doing? :)

@chriseth For the rebuilds in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/22 I specifically used the version defined in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.txt - so I generated a new ``soljson-v0.5.11+commit.c082d0b4.js``, not a ``soljson-v0.5.11+commit.22be8592.js``. If we change the list in solc-bin, I'll need to change the respective release in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/22 as well.

It's maybe not so important what is in the list, but we should not delete a previously available compiler binary.

@ekpyron can this be closed?

I don't think so - as far as I know, we only ever messed around with the soljson.js releases on solc-bin so far - this issue is about the commit hashes there being different from those of the same compiler version released elsewhere e.g. as docker image or as snap releases (the latter we don't control, though, do we?). So depending on where you get e.g. 0.5.11 you'll end up with different commit hashes... which is bad, but I'm not sure what to do about it, especially retrospectively...

We could at least add a new binary to solc-bin, but not sure if this would do more harm than good.

While adding Linux/Mac/Win binaries to `solc-bin` I compared all the `soljson` files with the ones on github (see the table in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/42#issuecomment-659770086) and only three versions are actually affected by this:
- 0.4.15
- 0.5.9
- 0.5.11

With 0.6.12 we have switched to adding release binaries to `solc-bin` manually and I'm also preparing a PR check to ensure that they always match those on the [release page](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) so this should not happen in the future.

What to do about those three cases? Would just adding both variations to `solc-bin` be acceptable? And if so, should they both be included in file lists or just the one from the release page.

Another problem is that we have three cases where binaries were built from the same exact commit but are not byte-for-byte identical:
- 0.2.0
- 0.2.1
- 0.4.11

Maybe I should just replace them in the repo with the ones from the release page?

Decision from today's call:
- We don't want to remove binaries that were already distributed via `solc-bin` so for `0.4.15`, `0.5.9`, `0.5.11` we're going to include both variants there.
- For `0.2.0`, `0.2.1` and `0.4.11` we will keep just one. We don't want to touch the one in `solc-bin` because that would change the hash of the binary, possibly making verification fail for people who are checking that. That's not a problem with the one on the release page so we're going to change that one.

### 0.4.15, 0.5.9 and 0.5.11
For the first part, here's a PR that adds the binaries built on different commits to solc-bin: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/57

### 0.2.0, 0.2.1 and 0.4.11
For the second, I have edited the releases ([0.2.0](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.2.0), [0.2.1](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.2.1), [0.4.11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.11)) to remove the old `soljson.js` files and add the ones from `solc-bin`.

By the way, in 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 the file name included also the date and commit hash, now they're all `soljson.js` like in newer releases; this is not consistent between releases anyway.

#### Original files
In case we ever need them (or want to roll back this change), here are the original files: [original-0.2.0-0.2.1-0.4.11-releases.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/5327663/original-0.2.0-0.2.1-0.4.11-releases.zip)

And their hashes (both old and new):
| Version | keccak256 (github)                                                   | keccak256 (solc-bin)                                                 |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.2.0   | `0x75c4aec16b19b148720cc889dec60f639bf5b31b5456bede69c7756d74f35804` | `0x7d8ea0312905d250ec7554bd84526c3d97d05f6d5748888e6ec00629bd3ea7a6` |
| 0.2.1   | `0x8f5a019f1aeda91cbcb20ddd512253a66babb63450c07e53d907c923d5059148` | `0x7067e5792a88111c06a7078a23358641a64d0fa273b5220bfa5212029352dbe9` |
| 0.4.11  | `0xae353b2d1da5ec2acb1bb54c35cf06bb2312d8f69f527f183d5b980d7afcb67a` | `0xde17e284da94d3d600c1096f05d83af794eef746d2aba2e4e066e3d3efce7abf` |

#### Versions reported by replaced files
Just in case I also used `solc-js` to check what the executables actually report as version:
| Version           | Output from `version()` |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 0.2.0 (github)    | `0.2.0-4dc2445e/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-1.1.0-c9886e9e/.-Emscripten/clang/int` 
| 0.2.0 (solc-bin)  | `0.2.0-4dc2445e/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-1.1.0-34716679/.-Emscripten/clang/int` 
| 0.2.1 (github)    | `0.2.1-91a6b35f/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-`
| 0.2.1 (solc-bin)  | `0.2.1-91a6b35f/.-Emscripten/clang/int linked to libethereum-`
| 0.4.11 (github)   | `0.4.11-nightly.2017.5.3+commit.68ef5810.Emscripten.clang`
| 0.4.11 (solc-bin) | `0.4.11+commit.68ef5810.Emscripten.clang`

So it looks like 0.4.11 is a nightly built from the tagged release commit, just like 0.4.15 for windows (#9545).
I checked `soljson.js` from 0.4.12 and 0.4.15 just in case but they all identify as release builds so (hopefully) those are just some individual cases.

The other two seem to have been built with `libethereum` checked out at a different commit.

Closing since the PR in solc/bin has been merged and the changes to github releases are done too.
