# [\#7540 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7540) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Remove redundant constraints in CHC

Currently there are redundant constraints in the function blocks before assertions:
```
block_x /\ constraints /\ !assertion -> error
block_x /\ constraints /\ assertion -> block_y
```
can be simplified to
```
block_x /\ constraints -> block_z
block_z /\ !assertion -> error
block_z /\ assertion -> block_y
```

The same happens with constructors, since they connect to both summary and interface blocks.

This easily gets complicated because the assertion expression might use fresh vars local to the block.
