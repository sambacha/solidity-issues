# [\#7585 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7585) `open`: [RFC] modeling gas cost in yul interpreter

## Description

The yul interpreter has no notion of gas cost because that is left to the underlying EVM implementation if I understand correctly.

However, it may be beneficial to model gas costs to flag instances where the yul optimizer increases gas consumption (one data point for consideration is #7472 )

I would not do this at the current time, since the optimizer is not taking gas costs into account at all.
Furthermore, this is really trade-off between code size and runtime cost, where it is not always clear which route to take.
