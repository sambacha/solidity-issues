Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7589#discussion_r344259919.
Is there a nice and easy way to have a pretty printing pass on the output? That would make those tests way easier to review.

The `commandlineTests` could `jq` the output, but not sure we want to add that dependency.

This should be very easy to do without extra dependencies now that #11583 is implemented. Just add the `--pretty-print` flag in `cmdlineTests.sh`, run it with `--update` and commit the result. I'm marking it as `good first issue`.
