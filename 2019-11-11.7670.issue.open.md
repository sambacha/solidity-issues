# [\#7670 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7670) `open`: Check "How solid is Solidity" by Matteo Di Pirro

Thesis: http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/61297/1/tesi_Di_Pirro.pdf
Article: https://fc19.ifca.ai/wtsc/SoliditySolid.pdf

The thesis might be more valuable for us than the article - the article seems to be about a different language that is similar to Solidity.
