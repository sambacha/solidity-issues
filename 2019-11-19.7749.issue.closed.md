# [\#7749 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7749) `closed`: Re-enable tests for push(...) via yul

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2019-11-19 15:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7749):

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7350 some semantic tests compiled via yul had to be disabled, since `push()` and `pop()` are not yet implemented for all types.

In order to re-enable them, all test cases containing the line `/// TODO enable again after push(..) via yul was implemented.` need to run their checks utilizing the `ALSO_VIA_YUL` macro.

Was this done entirely within https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7350 after all now?

There's still one missing (re nested arrays)

@mijovic do you remember by any chance if these were reenabled?

They were not enabled and fail with `Invalid conversion to storage type`.

@axic Some of them were activated with my changes, and some of them not. I can go troughout the tests and create list of items which are left to be done to close this one.

We'll just enable them when missing features are implemented as with all other tests.
