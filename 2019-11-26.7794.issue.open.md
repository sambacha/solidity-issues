# [\#7794 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7794) `open`: Add unit tests for devcore/FixedHash
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

We only have implicit tests for `FixedHash`, the closest is `test/libdevcore/Keccak256`.

Before adding tests it would make sense figuring out which features of `FixedHash` are needed, because it seems a lot of them wouldn't be used in Solidity.

From #10448:
> I have various branches removing features from FixedHash, tried to merge them here, but I think it will be easier to progress if we argue about them in separate PRs. Examples:
> 
> remove support for FixedHash<0>
> removing the bytesConstRef constructor
> removing indexing operator (and changing the ostream to use hex() simply) -- if we keep it, it should do a runtime error on out of bounds
> change what happens when input is too short / too large (currently it just sets the hash to zeroes)
