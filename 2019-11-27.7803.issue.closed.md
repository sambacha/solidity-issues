## Abstract

Although we have a time out in place in the yul interpreter to reduce the slow-down effect from infinite for loops of the form `for {} 1 {} {}`, it's an open question if there is any merit in generating them in the first place and waiting for them to time out. On the other hand, the problem infinite loops pose is that they slow down fuzzing. Most often a single infinite for loop test case can take over a second to execute (which is very slow compared to the average test throughput of ~50 executions per second for inputs not containing infinite for loops).

To be precise, the open question is: Are infinite for loops a legitimate corner case that has the potential to uncover a defect in the yul optimizer or the optimizer rule list? So far, my observation has been otherwise. Please note that we do have a bounded for loop generator of the form `for {let i = 0} lt(i, 0x60) {add(i, 0x20) } {}`. This issue only relates to unbounded for loops.

This issue tracks support for disabling generation of infinite for loops.

## Motivation

A for loop condition is an `Expression.` The only direct ways we can end up creating infinite for loops are
  - `Expression` is a constant literal
  - `Expression` contains a constant literal
  - `Expression` contains a yul optimizer dictionary token

So one possibility to disable infinite for loops is to track visits of for loop condition expressions, and selectively output "0" whenever the loop condition may reference a literal/dictionary token.

## Specification

Once this feature is implemented, `for {} 1 {} {}` and other variants of the for loop where the condition evaluates to a non-zero constant will be turned into `for {} 0 {} {}`.
