# [\#7811 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7811) `closed`: Split lexical analyzer into into dedicated ones for Solidity & Yul

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=3e46099035fcc96e01be5297c24450bf40d92134&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-11-27 15:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7811):

Currently both languages share the same scanner, that blocks some keywords for each other's language.

Despite rethinking the whole Scanner API on the one hand, we should separate those two subjects into one scanner (or it's rule definition set) per language (Solidity, Yul).

## Targeted Benefits:
* cleaner code separation
* free up some identifiers that aren't used in the other language
