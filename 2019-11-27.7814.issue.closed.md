* Some APIs from boost already went into the standard library.
* for Boost integer we can use the intx library (already seperate ticket)
* with regards to Boost.Ranges we should consider using [ranges-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) that are compatible with C++11/14/17 and is going to be part of C++20, too. (can become a "splitout"-ticket)

For reference: I suggested a similar approach in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7795#issuecomment-558846981, but we might not need it there
