https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7845 let the tests successfully pass again after https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/5f92adc2e76fe92d7ab952710ff3fb6d76066a35, but we should have another look at the tests in detail and verify that they correctly replace soljson.js with the version to be tested.

@ekpyron I think it works as expected. We're verifying after each compilation that the compiler version in the metadata matches the one of the soljson binary. Meaning that the Circle job would fail otherwise.

Nice and makes sense!

The removal of the workaround here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7845 is also included for 0.6.0 here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7784.
