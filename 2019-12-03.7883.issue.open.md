## Abstract

Since writing protobuf programs that generate specific yul test cases by hand is quite a pain, it would be nice to have a tool that accepts a valid yul program as input and translates it to a protobuf message, potentially printing it to an output file.

## Motivation

- main.cpp
  - yul parser parses input into an AST
  - write AST visitor that does the protobuf conversion
