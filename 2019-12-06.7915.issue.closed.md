# [\#7915 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7915) `closed`: Add solidity@0.5 to homebrew-ethereum

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2019-12-06 11:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7915):

There already is `solidity@0.4` (for 0.4.26) and with the release of 0.6.0, `solidity` will move to to that, so the only way to install 0.5.x series would be to include `solidity@0.5` as a package.

Let's do it!

Suggested course of action: after 0.5.14 is released, just duplicate the file as `solidity@0.5`.

Then we just proceed to update the base file when 0.6.0 is released.
