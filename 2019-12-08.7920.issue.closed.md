# [\#7920 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7920) `closed`: Add solidity highlighting support to rouge

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2019-12-08 21:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7920):

[rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) is a syntax highlighting library written in Ruby. It is used by Jekyll and [used by default by Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll#syntax-highlighting).

Having this implemented would mean Solidity is properly highlighted on eips.ethereum.org

Apparently a PR was submitted in 2017 by @veox, but it is still not merged: https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/pull/760

We should at least find a solution to have working syntax hilighting on solidity-blog.
