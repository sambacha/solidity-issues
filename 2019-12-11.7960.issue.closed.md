## Description

Merge of `develop_060` into `develop` breaks the abiv2 proto fuzzer for the following reason.

Earlier, dynamic storage arrays were resized using `.length`

```
// storage array
bool[] sv_0;
// Compilation error in 0.6.0
sv_0.length = 0
```

 `develop_060` forbids it because `.length` is now a read-only member. Now, we need to use the `push` member function. Example

```
// storage array
bool[] sv_0;
// Assume length is 3
sv_0.push(true);
sv_0.push(false);
sv_0.push(false);
```

So implicitly, `sv_0` in the code snippet above gets resized to a boolean array of length `3` whose contents are {true, false, false}.
