**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

## Abstract

Currently it reads like so
```
The smart contract also enforces a
timeout, so Alice is guaranteed to eventually recover their funds even if the
recipient refuses to close the channel. It is up to the participants in a payment
channel to decide how long to keep it open. For a short-lived transaction,
such as paying an internet café for each minute of network access, or for a longer relationship, such as paying an employee an hourly wage, a payment
￼could last for months or years.
```

The sentence ```For a short-lived transaction,
such as paying an internet café for each minute of network access, or for a longer relationship, such as paying an employee an hourly wage, a payment
￼could last for months or years.``` feels incomplete somehow and could be reworded.
