# [\#8031 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8031) `closed`: Run Yul optimizer on inline assembly (if it does not have external references)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-12-16 23:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8031):

Currently, the yul optimizer is only run on `CompilerStack::appendInlineAssembly`, i.e. for codegen-internal routines. We should also run it on user-supplied inline assembly, at least if it does not have any external references (as the optimizer cannot cope with it).
