# [\#8127 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8127) `closed`: Fix solc-bin upload script and rename 0.5.14 to full commit hash.
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `solc-bin`

The commit hash for ``0.5.14`` is ``01f1aaa4`` - however, in solc-bin the file is uploaded as
https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/soljson-v0.5.14%2Bcommit.1f1aaa4.js
So with the leading ``0`` missing.

I think we should fix our upload script to include leading zeros and rename the release in solc-bin (while updating the commit lists).

Otherwise if I look at the release in solc-bin, I assume the commit hash is ``1f1aaa4`` and if I want to fetch it in the repo I get ``error: pathspec '1f1aaa4' did not match any file(s) known to git``.

This is also the case for 
* `0.4.13`
* `0.1.3`
* `0.1.2`
* `0.1.1`

For the last two I can't find a corrected commit hash, but for `0.4.13` and `0.1.3` it's also just a missing zero.
I'll fix `0.5.14`, `0.4.13` and `0.1.3` in solc-bin, but we still have to fix our upload script - the issue can be expected to happen once in every 16 releases...

Wait a second... https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1074 explicitly changed the upload script to **remove** those leading zeroes... and there's a comment in the script about semver compatibility... so I think I'm not touching this for now, until this is clarified.

The filename is not formed from the commit hash, it is formed from the version string. The version string cannot have leading zeros after the `+` (a semver restriction) and thus it is created by taking the commit hash and removing any leading zeros.

But isn't `commit.` the "leading" part in this case? Or is this restriction true for any substring..number after the `+`?

Which definition of SemVer are we using? This one here even has a leading `0` after the `+` as example.. https://semver.org/#spec-item-10

The string is still split up into components separated by `.`.

You are right, @Marenz , the restriction only applies to the "prerelease" part, not the "build info" part. This is why the version is currently reported as `0.6.3-develop.2020.1.28+commit.c8994d9e.Linux.g++` instead of `0.6.3-develop.2020.01.28+commit.c8994d9e.Linux.g++` (the leading zero in the month is removed). So maybe the stripping of the zero was just not exact enough.

so this sounds like we can revert the change in #1074 for the commit hash.. checking the script further, this is only used for the metadata component. :+1:

So https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1074#discussion_r371322848 was **not** intentional after all :-)? The version string (as reported by "solc --version") actually *does* contain the leading zero in the commit hash, only the upload script removes it from *both* the date *and* the commit hash. So I agree with @Marenz in that in particular the line here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1074/files#r367942424 should be reverted, resp. removed (while the leading zero should still be removed from the date).

The commit contains two changes: Changing the date format from `-utc +%Y.%m.%d` to `-utc +%Y.%-m.%-d` (adding two `-`), and removing the leading zero in the commit hash. The first change is needed, the second is not.

The respective line that strips the leading zeroes from the commit hash is removed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8227 .
But we still need to decide how to deal with the old releases affected by this. We might want to keep the versions with the zeroes stripped in solc-bin, do we? If so we could add a symlink to the same release with the zero and have the lists point to the ones with zeros - but that would probably involve making an exception for these cases in the update script.
Or we could just ignore this for old releases...

Maybe we just ignore them for now...

The main problem in ignoring them is that I have added them *with* the leading zeroes to the ``wasm`` directory... "them" being 0.4.13 alone actually... so that might be confusing...

I'm adding the "to discuss" label to this, so that we can decide it's immediate fate.
