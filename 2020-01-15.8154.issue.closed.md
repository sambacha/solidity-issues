# [\#8154 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8154) `closed`: [Yul] Remove the stack height checks from AsmAnalyzer

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-01-15 22:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8154):

Direct access to the stack is not allowed any more, so we can remove most of the stack height checks.

Remove:

 - [x] AsmAnalysisInfo::stackHeightInfo
 - [x] AsmAnalyzer::m_stackHeight (some errors have to be checked differently, but we should also rephrase the error messages since they are all talking about the stack)
