## Abstract

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8189.

## Motivation

All Solidity examples are extracted and compiled as part of the command line tests. This should also be done for all Yul examples in order to make sure they compile (if they should)

## Specification

The following steps can be identfied already:
- add new task to `test/cmdlineTests.sh`
- change `scripts/isolate_tests.py` such that it can also extract Yul examples and save them to `*.yul` files
- alter `test/cmdlineTests.sh` such that it can compile Yul via `solc --assemble --strict-assembly`
