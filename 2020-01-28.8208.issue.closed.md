The fuzzer regression test is taking over 4 hours and timing out:

https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/249114#build-timing/containers/0/actions/103

If this is not an error, I think we should not use circleci for such long-running tasks.

I tried building the fuzzer locally, but failed:

It would also help if we had some documentation on how to build the fuzzer parts. So far we only have something with [`afl` fuzzing](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#running-the-fuzzer-via-afl) in the docu which seems to be something else.

For now I created a PR to just disable the tests. I am hoping @bshastry can investigate this properly when he is back.

Maybe we shouldn't close this as the actual problem isn't really solved?

Created #8219 to solve the actual problem.
