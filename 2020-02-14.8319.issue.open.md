We have custom sorting logic at least in ``SMTEncoder::mergeVariables``, in ``ControlFlowGraph::VariableOccurrence``, in ``sortByContract`` in ``OverrideChecker`` in ``OverrideProxy::operator<`` in ``OverrideChecker::CompareByID``, in ``ConstStateVarCircularReferenceChecker::findCycle`` and will probably get a new one in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8311.

They are not all exactly the same, but it might still be worth thinking about a generalized solution to some or all of them.

We should add an operator that compares by ID and a callable object that takes ast pointers and compares them.

We have something like that in `ASTForward.h`:  [`ASTCompareByID`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.12/libsolidity/ast/ASTForward.h#L104-L121).

But I think that part of the task here would be to have the other, custom, comparators extend it rather than just do it from scratch?

The issue predates the fact that we have this :-). So the main question now is: is this actually used everywhere it can be used?

My guess would be that it isn't and that ``ASTCompareByID`` would also need smart pointer cases, etc., but I haven't checked.

`ASTNode` uses it:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/466251b5a0d20a4b532e03ca4884000432690507/libsolidity/ast/AST.h#L74

We at least still have ``OverrideChecker::CompareByID`` and ``CallGraph::CompareWithID``, so it's not completely unified.
