## Abstract

At the moment, we have a single config parameter (pipeline parameter) that to reference docker image revisions. This is going to be a problem as specific docker images may need updating (see #8355 ).

Issue tracks support for separate config parameters per referenced docker image so that we need only update/tag changed images.
