# [\#8435 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8435) `closed`: [Sol->Yul] Index range access to calldata arrays and index access to calldata array slices.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-03-06 08:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8435):

The following contains a (potentially non-exhaustive) set of features missing in Sol->Yul in the context of array slices.
```
contract C
{
  function f(uint256[] calldata x) public returns (uint256) {
    x[1:3]; // IndexRangeAccess to calldata array
    x[1:3][1:2]; // IndexRangeAccess to calldata array slice
    x[1:3][0]; // IndexAccess to array slice
    x[1:3].length; // Member access to calldata array slice.
    return g(x[1:3]); // implicit conversion from calldata array slice to regular calldata array
  }
  function g(uint256[] calldata y) public returns (uint256) {
    return y[0]; // resp. "return y.length;", etc.
  }
}
```

- [ ] The first step would be to implement ``IRGeneratorForStatements::endVisit(IndexRangeAccess)`` for dynamic calldata arrays. We can start with only a base-type of ``uint256``.

- [ ] A second step could be to implement the ``.length`` member access on calldata array slices. That would enable first test cases to run.

- [ ] The third step would be conversions from calldata array slices to calldata arrays. That's basically a no-operation since calldata arrays and calldata array slices have the same stack representation. Once this is done, the ``g(x[1:3])`` call in the example above should work and we can start constructing test cases.

- [ ] An alternative third step or otherwise fourth step would be index accesses to calldata array slices. That would enable ``x[1:3][0]`` as above and would also enable more meaningful test cases.

- [ ] After that ``IndexRangeAccess`` to calldata array slices are left.

There may be more steps after that, but let's see when we get there.

@mijovic will start working on this.
