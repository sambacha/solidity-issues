## Description

Variables cannot be declared immediately after `try` / `catch` blocks.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.3+commit.8dda9521.Emscripten.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04

## Steps to Reproduce

The following contract does not compile:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Test {
  uint private _value;

  function test (address ext) external {
    try Test(ext).test(ext) {} catch {}
    uint a = 1;
    _value = a;
  }
}
```

This error is returned: `DeclarationError: Undeclared identifier. "a" is not (or not yet) visible at this point.`.

However, compilation succeeds if an `if` block precedes the variable declaration, as in the following contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Test {
  uint private _value;

  function test (address ext) external {
    try Test(ext).test(ext) {} catch {}
    if (true) {}
    uint a = 1;
    _value = a;
  }
}
```
