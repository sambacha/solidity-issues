**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

The issue that https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8470 fixes is that the command line tests run the SMTChecker docs examples but are not aware whether there is a solver available or not, which makes it hard to decide on the test message to use:

- `This will report a warning`: this happens if there are no solvers available or the SMTChecker reports an assertion violation
- `This will not compile`: disables the test and is currently used there

This doesn't sound simple to implement and I'm not sure it's very valuable. So I'd suggest closing.
