# [\#8499 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8499) `open`: Better syntax for declaring nested mappings.
**Labels**: `waiting for more input`, `language design :rage4:`

At some point today I found myself declaring the following mapping:

```mapping(bytes32 => mapping(bytes32 => mapping(bytes32 => mapping(uint256 => MyEntry)))) internal m_lookuptable;```

I get this is a bit of an extreme case, but I might not be the only one nesting mappings. So I wondered, why not replace it with:

```mapping(bytes32 => bytes32 => bytes32 => uint256 => MyEntry) internal m_lookuptable;```

It should be pretty easy for the parser to adapt to this syntax, no backend modification should be necessary, and the result would be much more readable.
Also, it doesn't break anything, so backward compatibility would be unaffected.

Thanks for your suggestion, @Amaxx! I'm wondering whether you really need a data structure that support "partial evaluation" or if what you really need is tuples as keys for mappings.

So it would rather be
```
mapping(bytes32, bytes32, bytes32, uint256 => MyEntry) internal m_lookuptable;
```

and you would use `m_lookuptable["1", "2", "3", 1]` instead of  `m_lookuptable["1"]["2"]["3"][1]`

It would also have the benefit that you only need to compute one hash instead of 4.

Perhaps using the tuple syntax we have is more clear:
```
mapping((bytes32, bytes32, bytes32, uint256) => MyEntry) internal m_lookuptable;
```

Btw @Amxx, it occurred to me that you can (almost) already do this albeit at a memory cost: can use a single `bytes32` key and hash your keys (`keccak256(abi.encode(a, b, c,...))`). With `bytes.concat` (#10903) this should be clarified to `keccak256(bytes.concat(a, b, c, ...)`.

So basically the tuple syntax is a memory-efficient and more easy to ready alternative to the above.

We should keep in mind that potentially the codegen should be able to avoid the memory overhead, if it is clever enough.
