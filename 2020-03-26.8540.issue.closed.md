# [\#8540 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8540) `closed`: [Inheritance] Error on library functions that are "virtual"
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

The following should result in a compiler error (the `virtual` keyword is meaningless because libraries cannot be inherited) but is silently ignored.

```
library L {
    function f() internal pure virtual returns (uint) { return 0; }
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc <input.sol>
```

Place of implementation is probably bool TypeChecker::visit(FunctionDefinition const& _function)

This is a breaking change, but I guess no real smart contract would have used it anyway.
