## Description

I'm trying to verify signature and parse it using `abi.decode`, not assembly. However, `abi.decode` fails for no reason.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.4
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): istanbul
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): any
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ganache-cli, remix EVM
- Operating system: macOS

## Steps to Reproduce

```
contract Test {
    function getUserFromSignature(
        bytes memory signature
    )
        public
        returns (address)
    {
        require(signature.length == 65, "Wrong signature length!");
        bytes32 r;
        bytes32 s;
        uint8 v;
        (r, s, v) = abi.decode(signature, (bytes32, bytes32, uint8));
    }
}
```

I'm calling function with `"0x49023da0a11914ff15521e582a11c38150d5d361266161ca481ee3fc55cc5f7c16d77c35a8d4d037bfebda015c8194d09fb85d8f863bf16d9b7b8273fa8f8e851c"`.
I've tried to use `byte`, `bytes1` instead `uint8`, but it fails anyway.
I've tried to debug tx, seems like for some reason it compares `signature.length` with `0x60`, not with `0x41` and thus fails.

ABI encoding always pads to multiple of 32 bytes, that's why it fails.

Hi, @chriseth! Thanks for the quick response.

But if i do `abi.decode(signature, (bytes32, bytes32, bytes32));` it fail also, so the only option is to add 31 bytes of zeroes when calling the function (i.e. to set `signature.length` to 96) and this does not seem the good option...

I'm sorry, but `abi.decode` is meant for abi decoding, not for unpacking binary data. 

This is a perfect task for inline assembly and a random internet search resulted in the following, for example: https://gist.github.com/BjornvdLaan/e41d292339bbdebb831d0b976e1804e8

I've seen the assembly solution, but I do not want to use assembly in my code (but seems like I'll have to).

Thanks anyway!

Assembly is really not that scary and dangerous as most people think. I actually am of the opinion that it is better to have reviewable user-supplied assembly routines than some compiler-internal routines that are much harder to find.

This statement was more true when it was introduced. As we transition more over to Yul, the less scary it becomes.
