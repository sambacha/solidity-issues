# [\#8660 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8660) `closed`: Comments in solidity files not parsed correctly

When parsing any solidity contract, that contains a comment (either single line // or multi-line /* */) I am getting the following error:

`{"contracts":{},"errors":[{"component":"general","formattedMessage":"Contract.sol:1:2569: ParserError: Function, variable, struct or modifier declaration expected.\n ... someLastlineOfMySolContract));        _;    }}\n                                        ^\n","message":"Function, variable, struct or modifier declaration expected.","severity":"error","sourceLocation":{"end":2568,"file":"Contract.sol","start":2568},"type":"ParserError"}],"sources":{}}`

When deleting the comments out manually or by regex, I'm not facing this issue anymore.

Can someone reproduce this?

Can you give more details about how you're running it? Is it via `solc-js`? Using `--standard-json`?
Without that it's hard to try and reproduce it. Comments work fine for me in general.
