The CHC engine actually can handle these constraints, but it doesn't check for overflow/underflow.

There doesn't seem to be any real complaint now:
```
Warning: Unused local variable.
 --> 8668.sol:7:7:
  |
7 |       uint tmp = i - start;
  |       ^^^^^^^^
```

Is this supposed to work now?

Ah nice that it doesn't complain about the underflow anymore. Yea it's supposed to work.
