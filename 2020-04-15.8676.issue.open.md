See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2681#issuecomment-355277311 ?

Probably as part of the "style guide" section.

Closes #2681.

Is this issue still relevant now that the full support for highlighting `.sol` files has been added (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2681#issuecomment-699548802)?

I think it is useful to have a single line, because `.gitattributes` can be used out of github. The issue has been "solved" for github, which can also be mentioned.
