 - [ ] add "hasJumpsub" function to the evm version and make it return true for "berlin"
 - [ ] add the jumpsub, beginsub and returnsub opcodes to instructions.cpp (move them around and assign the correct number - do not care about breaking evm1.5).
 - [ ] make sure that jumpsub, beginsub and returnsub cannot be used in yul directly
 - [ ] change the EVMCodeTransform to use jumpsub, beginsub, returnsub for yul functions

Maybe we should remove evm1.5 support altogether with this change.
