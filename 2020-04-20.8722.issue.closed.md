# [\#8722 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8722) `closed`: [CLI] Introduce `--ir-bin` to output binary via yul

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-04-20 21:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8722):

Currently it is rather complicated process to get a binary via Yul:
1. `solc --ir input.sol > input.yul`
2. remove the "IR:" lines
3. `solc --strict-assembly input.yul`

If `--ir-bin` is introduced, we would need to deprecate it when we switch over to Yul completely and at that point `--bin` would use it.

The idea was to make it combersome to prevent people from using it.

I would prefer a solution that just switches the whole pipeline to yul-ir-mode right away.

That would be ideal but `--ir-bin` seems to be more in line with the "cumbersome" method.

What about ``--experimental-enable-ir``?

What would that do? Switch all the internal pipeline?

Switch into full "compile via yul" mode.
