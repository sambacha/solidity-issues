# [\#8731 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8731) `closed`: Add a test about payable constructor in inheritance

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-04-22 09:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8731):

Do we have a test that checks that a contract can receive ether upon construction if the contract itself does not have a constructor, but it is inheriting from a contract that has a payable constructor?

I would say so, yes - didn't know about this issue. Even though we ended up *not* allowing to receive ether in the case described in the issue :-).
