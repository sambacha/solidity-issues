# [\#8786 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8786) `open`: [solidity-upgrade] Incorrect override during upgrade (low-priority)

## Description

This is to record a bug in solidity-upgrade ([context](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8741/files#r415719390)) It creates incorrect placement of overrides.

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.0.0;

interface ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) virtual external;
}

contract OneTxPaymentFactory is ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) external {
      require (1 == 1);
  }
}
```
Upgrade generated by `solidity-upgrade`. (See the extra `override` after `require`.)

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.0.0;

interface ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) virtual external;
}

contract OneTxPaymentFactory is ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) override external {
      require (1 == 1) override;
  }
}
```

### Notes
1. This appeared while trying to upgrade [ColonyNetwork.](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork)
2. Low priority since solidity-upgrade is mostly an internal tool and fixing this isn't so important.
