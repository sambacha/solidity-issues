## Abstract
In the release, there's no windows executable. 
<!--
Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.
-->

## Motivation
Others might want it?
<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

## Specification
I tried to build it myself, it would not work....
<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

I'm sorry, but we do not plan to provide windows binaries for these old releases. Please use the js binary instead.
