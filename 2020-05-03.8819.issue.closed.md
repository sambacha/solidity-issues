# [\#8819 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8819) `closed`: Should we add `0x00 0x00` to the end of the bytecode for "no metadata"?

In order to make metadata removal / detection consistent, the "no metadata" version of the bytecode should end in two zero bytes (the length of the cbor structure).

I was looking at `CompilerStack` the past minutes trying to figure out where CBOR is turned off. It isn't ðŸ˜“
