# [\#8827 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8827) `open`: Unchecked assembly or reconsidering cleanups.
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `language design :rage4:`

In old codegen cleanups are performed when reading from memory and before any operation.

In Sol->Yul codegen cleanups are performed when reading from memory and after inline assembly blocks.

We could consider to clean up less, i.e. always assume clean stack variables or memory contents.

Arguments are basically:
- Inline assembly should allow for maximum speed/gas savings. People should know what they are doing and take care of properly handling things themselves.

vs.
- Safety should come first, mistakes in assembly should not bleed into the rest of the language and you can always use ``uint256`` types to avoid the cleanups.

We were considering to change the behaviour for Sol->Yul codegen, but at the time of writing will keep it at least almost as in old codegen. This issue is for considering to change the behavior in a breaking change in the future.

With Sol->Yul an alternative to changing the behaviour in general would be some kind of ``unchecked assembly`` block that does not perform cleanups.
