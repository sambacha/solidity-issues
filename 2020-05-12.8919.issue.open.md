# [\#8919 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8919) `open`: Equality comparison for tuples.
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

I'm not sure if we actually urgently need this as a language feature, but I found it rather annoying in writing tests that I can't do:

```
function f() public returns (uint256 a, uint256 b) { ... }
function g() public { assert(f() == (1, 2)); }
```

So I think allowing equality comparisons, i.e. ``==`` and ``!=``, for tuple expressions would be a nice convenience feature. For other operators like ``<`` there's no clear unique definition, so if we want this at all, we should stick to ``==`` and ``!=`` only.
