## Description

This contract:
```solidity
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract c {
	function f() internal returns (uint) {
	}
		bool b = (f() == 0) && (f() == 0);
	function g() public returns (bool) {
	}
}
```

produces:

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/home/user/solidity/libsolidity/formal/SMTEncoder.cpp(1646): Throw in function set<const solidity::frontend::VariableDeclaration *> solidity::frontend::SMTEncoder::touchedVariables(const solidity::frontend::ASTNode &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: 
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = 
```

when compiled with solc

On master, using AFL fuzzing.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer.  I threw ALL the .sol files under libsolidity into the corpus, so it's effectively fuzzing the SMTChecker and such now, also, I expect this will turn up some things.

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.6.8-develop.2020.5.13+commit.1700bdc4.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

declaration of `g` is not needed, but I can't get the duplicated `f() == 0` to go away with a reducer

Reducing a bit more:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract c {
    function f() internal returns (bool) {}
    bool b = f() && f();
}
```

The second `f()` is needed because this is triggered by the code that does short circuiting.

I think this is only a partial fix.  Fuzzing latest I get:

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract c {
	uint x;
	function f() internal returns (uint) {
		x = x + 1;
	}
		bool b = (f() > 0) || (f() > 0);
}
```

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/home/user/solidity/libsolidity/formal/VariableUsage.cpp(107): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::smt::VariableUsage::checkIdentifier(const solidity::frontend::Identifier &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: 
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = 
```

(that's with `Version: 0.6.9-develop.2020.5.28+commit.0b216f57.Linux.clang` -- it does fix my original and Leonard's minimized version)

@leonardoalt I think this is a partial fix; reopen or should I submit a new issue with the above code?  you've seen the original fix, is this just a variant corner case, or fundamentally different (if similar)?

I need to look into it but can't really see why the previous fix wouldn't fix this as well, so reopening.

Indeed, this is an effect of the PR that close it initially. That PR missed 2 lines of code that should be fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9068.
