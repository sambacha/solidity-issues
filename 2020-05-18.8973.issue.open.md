# [\#8973 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8973) `open`: [SMTChecker] CHC support external calls to known code

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-05-18 16:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8973):

This differs from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8972 when the called code is known.
If that's used, the model can be strengthened.
However, the state would need to be passed around to the called function and back with potential updates.

The implementation idea is to use an SMT array per contract type where the index is its address.
