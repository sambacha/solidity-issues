There are uncaught ICEs when trying to create inline arrays of some types (this is minor, since you couldn't do anything useful with such arrays anyways).

```
    [msg]; // the predefined msg struct
    [arr[0:1]]; // where arr is any kind of array
    [type(C)]; // where C is a contract
```

The two first give the following:
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/ast/Types.h(215): Throw in function virtual unsigned int solidity::frontend::Type::calldataEncodedSize(bool) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: 
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = 
```

The last one is slightly different:
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/ast/Types.h(841): Throw in function virtual std::unique_ptr<solidity::frontend::ReferenceType> solidity::frontend::ArraySliceType::copyForLocation(solidity::frontend::DataLocation, bool) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: 
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = 
```
