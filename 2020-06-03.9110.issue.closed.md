# [\#9110 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9110) `closed`: [Sol->Yul] Support exponentiation in constants

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-06-03 14:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9110):

The following should compile:
```
    uint constant DEPOSIT_CONTRACT_TREE_DEPTH = 32;
    // NOTE: this also ensures `deposit_count` will fit into 64-bits
    uint constant MAX_DEPOSIT_COUNT = 2**DEPOSIT_CONTRACT_TREE_DEPTH - 1;
```
This previously attempted by #8945.

Closes #8853.

I don't think this is different from regular 'exp'.

It is not, unless we would have constant expressions. Is there a tracking issue for support `exp` in sol-yul?

The value of the constant is just treated as a regular expression: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp#L196
