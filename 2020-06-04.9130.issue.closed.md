# [\#9130 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9130) `closed`: Investigate soljson.js memory leaks.

Creating an empty contract, setting remix to "auto-compile" and keeping to add and remove empty lines to the contract (waiting just long enough for remix to actually start recompiling) apparently seems to let the process memory usage grow without bounds and eventually causes remix to stall e.g. on cursor movement...
I'm experiencing this on recent Archlinux and Firefox 76.0.1.
I'm still figuring out which versions are affected or if it's all of them, but noticed it for 0.6.8 and 0.6.9 already.
This may be an issue in Firefox or in Remix and not in solidity - but we should still try to figure out what's going on there and what platforms and browsers are affected...

Just confirmed with ``soljson-v0.5.13-nightly.2019.11.6+commit.56a3abcd.js`` - which is *not* a wasm build.

But on the other hand I *don't* have the problem on chromium - not sure that means "not our fault".

Seems to be related to the remix debugger rather than us... I'm closing this again for now.

I am sorry
