# [\#9148 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9148) `open`: [SMTChecker] Support memory/storage pointers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-06-08 08:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9148):

Currently aliasing is "supported" by erasing knowledge about all variables of reference type T when another variable of type T is modified (assignment, push, pop).
This includes subtypes of arrays/mappings, for example.

This issue collects ideas on how to implement better support for those.

Idea:

Arrays are currently represented as an SMT tuple `(SMT-Array array, SMT-Integer length)`. This could be extended to `(SMT-array array, SMT-Integer length, SMT-Integer location)` where `location` represents a memory region/storage slot. Thus,
```
\forall t1,t2
(t1.location = t2.location) => (t1.array = t2.array) /\ (t1.length = t2.length)
```

Every storage pointer with a known value could be "inlined" as index access. But inlining would be a bit tricky:

```
contract C {
  uint256[][] a;
  function f(uint256 idx) public pure {
    uint256 x = idx;
    uint256[] storage b = a[x]; // would remember that b points to a with the index being a fixed SSA state of x
   x = 42; // increases SSA index of x
   a[x][0] = 21; // changes SSA index of ``a``
   b[4] = 3; // ``b`` should refer to new SSA index of ``a``, accessed at old SSA index of ``x``...
  }
}
```

Alternatively, there could be a symbolic arrays for any type of arrays and arrays would be accessed by indexing into these arrays. But depending on how often these kind of things happen, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9148#issuecomment-640465177 might be more efficient and easier on the solvers.
(Arrays of arrays would even have to be arrays of indices into the "global" array for the base type of the inner array for ``uint[] storage b = a[x];`` to work... not sure how indices would be assigned, s.t. exactly the right ones are distinct and the right ones are equal, etc...)
