# [\#9194 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9194) `closed`: Docs should be updated to build `Release` compiler by default

	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

When attempting to build the compiler from source, I follow the instructions, e.g, here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.10/installing-solidity.html#command-line-build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make
```

It turns out this misses a step that _does_ happen in the next direction given:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

which is to set the build type as `Release` (instead of `Prerelease`).

It would be nice if the docs above were updated to reflect the correct way to configure `cmake` so that the default build is `Release`. I ran into this a few times when working on a recent smart contract and wanted to use the latest version of the compiler:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.10
// some cool dapp
```

would fail w/ the source build according to the first block of instructions as it outputs a `Prerelease` compiler.

## Environment

NOTE: this is solely (?) a documentation issue.

- Compiler version: v0.6.9 and v0.6.10 but this has likely been around before those versions of the compiler
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): ...
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Geth
- Operating system: macOS

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
```
-->

See above.

Building directly from the git source code will result in a prerelease version unless special measures are taken. I would recommend to build not from git but using the .tar.gz that is linked on the release page.
