At first glance, it looks like the map `m_immutableVariables` (in class `CompilerContext) which is supposed to hold memory offsets for immutable variables
  - registers an entry for the immutable variable offset post constructor visit
  - does not contain the offset before or at some point during function def visit and the assertion is thrown

Not sure at what point memory offset info is cleared and why.
