FWIW syntax of `(((,))) = ((2),3)` seems to be
  - LHS: tuple of tuples of tuples
  - RHS: tuple of tuples

How is this syntactically valid since RHS has one fewer tuple dimension? I'm worried if this is rather a bug in the parser and not SMT Checker.

Edit: The following parses successfully (note: without smt checker pragma)

```
contract C {
        function f() public {
                (((,))) = ((2),3);
        }
}
```

I think the way this is interpreted on the LHS is that if you have a tuple of one element, you can discard the outer tuple. This happens to the first 2 levels of the LHS, ending up with a tuple of 2 elements, which fits the RHS.

Whether this should be the accepted behavior or not I'm not sure.
