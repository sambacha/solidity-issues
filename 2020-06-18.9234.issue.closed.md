<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

```
==== Source: i0.sol ====
import "i0.sol" as I0;
import "i1.sol" as I1;
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
	uint[][] a;
	function f() public {
		a.push();
		a[0].push();
		a[0][0] = 16;
		uint[] storage b = a[0];
		b[0] = 32;
		assert(a[0][0] == 16);
	}
}
==== Source: i1.sol ====
import "i1.sol" as I1;
contract D {
	uint16[] inner = [1, 2,6];
	uint32[][] data;
	function test() public returns (uint x, uint y, uint z) {
		data.push(inner);
		bytes21  inner;
	}
}
```

throws

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b1d22ab2c8de9d5cecf05ec169b2414d1bfa4538/libsmtutil/SolverInterface.h#L151

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ isoltest <input.sol>
```

Here's a single file test case that throws the same ICE (file must be named `test.sol`)

```
import "test.sol" as T;
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
	uint[][] a;
	function f() public {
		a.push();
		a[0].push();
		a[0][0] = 16;
		uint[] storage b = a[0];
		b[0] = 32;
		assert(a[0][0] == 16);
	}
}
contract D {
	uint16[] inner = [1, 2, 6];
	uint32[][] data;
	function test() public returns (uint x, uint y, uint z) {
		data.push(inner);
		bytes21  inner;
	}
}
```

that may be reproduced via

```
$ solc test.sol
```

Here is an even more trimmed test case that throws the same ICE. Looks like imports were redundant but somehow the fuzzer found it through an import but not otherwise.

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract D {
        int16[] inner;
        int[][] data;
        function t() public {
                data.push(inner);
        }
}
```
