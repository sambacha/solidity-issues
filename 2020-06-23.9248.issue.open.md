# [\#9248 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9248) `open`: Add (and require) keyword for the default state mutability of functions
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `language design :rage4:`

Proposals:
 - mutating
 - mutable
 - mutator
 - mut
 - impure
 - write
 - touch
 - default 
 - nonpayable
 - unrestricted
 - `!`

Reason for requiring the keyword:
 - it is easier to see at a glance what the state mutability of the function is and it is possible to search for it

"mutable" might be more appropriate than "mutating". Looks more appropriate in a sentence. The function `foo` is mutating v/s The function `foo` is mutable.

@hrkrshnn I think I disagree - the function is mutating the contract's state, it is not that the function itself is modified.

@chriseth I think 'mutating' doesn't fit with the existing tags: pure, view, payable. It would fit better if it was 'viewing' instead of 'view'.

 Maybe 'mutable' isn't a good replacement, since it has a different meaning in other languages.

It would be nice if the form of the word was of similar form with `pure`/`view`/`payable`.  `mutable` does seem to align better with `payable`.  I'm not actually sure how to use any in a sentence though without leaning on my existing understanding of their definitions!

We could also use `mut`...

Ugh, while I can appreciate that it would resolve the requirements I mentioned (something that can be searched for and is immediately visible), I have a pretty strong disdain for abbreviations in code.  ðŸ˜–

Another suggestion: **impure**.

`write`?  `touch`?

Another option: in Ruby names can contain characters like `!` and `?` and the convention for methods that modify the state of the object is to add `!` to the name: `C.append! x `.
`?` is used for methods that return boolean values (e.g `empty?`). The convention originally comes from Scheme.

We could also require the object to be an explicit parameter: `C.append(this, x)` or `C.append(self, x)`. This is how bound library methods already work. If we ever make arguments immutable by default (#715), distinguishing between methods that modify the object and ones that don't would be a natural extension: `function append(C mutable this, uint x)`.

If we want a keyword though - what about `mutator`?
I think that `mutable` kind of works too - it's used this way e.g. for c++ lambdas. Though `mutating` is clearer.

Idea that came up in the design meeting: make the default `pure` and add a new keyword for the previously default behaviour

I would still prefer explicit labels for everything, though if you are going to default then I think defaulting to `pure` is significantly better than defaulting to `mutable` (or whatever we end up calling it).

I agree with `pure` as default

We should perhaps also consider #3221 under the same discussion.

I think `pure`, `view`, `nonpayable/mutable/mutating`, `payable` is the order we should have and not consider any of them implicitly. 

`nonpayable` is a bit too long, `mutating` implies an active role in making changes, while `mutable` is more passive. Additionally `mutable` suggest the function may be mutable, i.e. replaceable so probably not a good idea.

*Useless blurb: Initially I was going to argue for `mutating` because a mutating function is known to be actively using opcodes which cause state changes, while in the case of `payable` it depends on inputs (whether there is a value or not). However, `mutating` functions can also be non-mutating depending on external input.*

---

We could also consider moving to a different system, for example the following: Consider everything pure by default and introduce a new field/modifier called `state` and let it have multiple flags: `read`, `write`, `payable`.

Examples:
- `function f() state(read) {}`
- `function f() state(write) {}`
- `function f() state(read,write) {}`
- `function f() state(read,write,payable) {}`
- `function f() state(payable,selfdestruct) {}`

Arguable as we have established some of these states imply others, such as it would be unrealistic to have a payable function which does not reads or writes -- albeit possible which does not "writes" if we assume balance changes not caused by the contract do not mean "writing".

Wish to add more flags:
- call
- viewcall
- delegatecall
- codecall
- create
