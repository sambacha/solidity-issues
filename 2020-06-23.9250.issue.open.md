**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Abstract

The syntax and semantic test classes both derive from `TestCase` but implement `printSource` differently even though this is not necessary especially since #9210 enables multi source semantic tests (previously only single source semantic tests were possible).

This issue tracks support for refactoring `printSource` and possibly helper functions such that syntax and semantic test classes share (instead of duplicating) code.
