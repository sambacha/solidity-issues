We talked briefly about PR on the call today. It implements [EIP-2678](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2678) and is waiting for some feedback. We decided to discuss it in more detail on the next call.

To compare the two metadata structures, I provide both in their full form and re-use items that are identical in both structures by abbreviating them in angle brackets.

current metadata:
```
{
  version: 1,
  language: "Solidity",
  compiler: { version: <compilerVersion> },
  sources: [ ... ],
  settings: <settingsForMetadata> // plus settings.compilationTarget[sourceUnitName] = <fullyQualifiedContractNameToBeCompiled>,
  output: {
    abi: <abi>,
    userdoc: <userdoc>,
    devdoc: <devdoc>
  }
}
```

EthPM/3 metadata:
```
{
  manifest: "ethpm/3",
  compilers: [{
    name: "solidity",
    version: <compilerVersion>,
    settings: <settingsForMetadata>,
    contractTypes: [ <contractNameToBeCompiled> ]
  }],
  // The sources object is mostly the same, the only difference is that this
  // uses ...[sourceName].checksum = {algorithm: "keccak256", hash: <hash>} instead of ...[sourceName].keccak256 = <hash>
  sources: [ ... ],
  contractTypes: {
    <contractNameToBeCompiled>: {
      sourceID: <sourceName>,
      abi: <abi>
      userdoc: <userdoc>,
      devdoc: <devdoc>
 }
}
```

There was some talk about packages in the Foundry TG group.
This doesn't look too complicated, but the quality of the EIP itself is debatable.
I think we should decide on whether we're doing this or not, and just do it or close it.
