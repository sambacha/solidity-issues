## Abstract

At the moment, we only fuzz full optimiser suite. The drawback is that bugs within single optimisation steps (such as https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9271#pullrequestreview-440717478) may evade detection.

This issue tracks support for enabling more fine grained optimiser fuzzing.
