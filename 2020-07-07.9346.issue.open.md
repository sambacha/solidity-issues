Hello all - Thanks for all the hard work on solc and taking the time to look at this Issue!

## Description

I am trying to utilize `--base-path` to reduce a large number of import remappings in the compiler configuration required in my project. When using `--base-path` I expecteded that only contract imports would be effected but solidity source URLs are *also* prepended with base path (as far as I can tell this behavior is undocumented).  

In practice this means that in order to use `--bash-path` - the entire solidity source tree *and* import remapping tree must share the same base path, which is not the case for all projects.  

Since my project uses many contracts defined across multiple directories, I'd like to be able to specify solidity source URLs as absolute paths in the typical manner via compiler input configuration *and*  use `--base-path` to effect import remapping as *separate* configuration values.  If source URLs *must* be remapped with `--base-path` - In my opinion the ideal behavior is to prepend `--base-path` to relative source file URLs and ignore absolute paths.

## Environment

- Compiler version: v0.6.11
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Berlin (although not applicable here)
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04

## Steps to Reproduce

##### File Hierarchy
```
- main
    - contracts
        - my_contract.sol
        - my_lib.sol
- tests
    - contracts
        - test_contract.sol
```

##### JSON Compiler Input Configuration
```
{...,
sources: {
    'my_contract.sol': {'urls': ['/my/absolute/path/main/contracts/my_contract.sol']},
    'my_lib.sol': {'urls': ['/my/absolute/path/main/contracts/my_lib.sol']},
    ...,
    'test_contract.sol': {'urls': ['/my/absolute/path/tests/contracts/test_contract.sol']},
    }
...
}
``` 

##### Solidity Source
```
import "contracts/my_lib.sol";
```

##### Compiler Command
```
solc --base-path /my/absolute/path/main ...
```

#### Symptom

The  `--base-path` option appears to prepend a path to the absolute source file URL unexpectedly resulting in `/my/absolute/path/main/my/absolute/path/main/contracts/my_contract.sol` leading to a file not found exception raised:

```
{"component":"general","formattedMessage":"Cannot import url(\"/my/absolute/path/main/contracts/my_contract.sol"): File not found..."
```

I thoroughly tested and documented the current base path behavior in #11036 and I originally thought that this issue is one of the cases I found there but after looking at this closer, it's not. The `urls` parameter essentially gives us another level of indirection after the mapping which is not available when not using `--standard-json`.

Anyway, it definitely should not affect absolute paths. This is a bug.

I'm not sure how relative paths should behave here though. Should base path even affect something like `{'urls': ['contracts/my_contract.sol']}` at all? And without base path, should it be relative to the current working directory or path of the JSON file? I'd say the latter but what if the JSON file comes from the standard input? Should `./` and `../` have special behavior (i.e. be relative to the file path) like in imports?
