https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9352 reports multi-tx counterexamples but only for value types.
We could also try to format arrays.
Example counterexample:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
  
contract C {
    uint[] a;
    function p() public {
        a.push();
    }
    function inv() public {
        assert(a.length < 5);
    }
}
```
```
Transaction trace:
constructor()
State: a = (|uint256[]_tuple| ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0) 0)
p()
State: a = (|uint256[]_tuple| ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0) 1)
p()
State: a = (|uint256[]_tuple| ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0) 2)
p()
State: a = (|uint256[]_tuple| ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0) 3)
p()
State: a = (|uint256[]_tuple| ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0) 4)
p()
State: a = (|uint256[]_tuple| ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0) 5)
inv()
```

Array cexs are usually reported as first a const array, in this case all zeroes, followed by stores to specific locations. The length is also there.
In this case, it could be reported as:
```
Transaction trace:
constructor()
State: a = []
p()
State: a = [0]
p()
State: a = [0, 0]
p()
State: a = [0, 0, 0]
p()
State: a = [0, 0, 0, 0]
p()
State: a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
inv()
```

This is reported to me as
```
Warning: Assertion violation happens here.
 --> 9379.sol:9:9:

  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: 
Counterexample:

Yes, because there's a guard that only value types are reported. What I wrote is what would be shown without that `if`.
