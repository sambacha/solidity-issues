## Description
The Windows version provided in the [`v0.4.15` release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.15) is a nightly build.

```
C:\> solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.15-nightly.2017.8.10+commit.8b45bddb.Windows.msvc
```

I encountered this in the py-solc-x CI when a [Windows job failed](https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x/runs/919482229?check_suite_focus=true) after I added an additional check to verify the solc version after installing. I have confirmed it locally in a virtual machine.

## Environment

- Compiler version: `0.4.15`
- Operating system: Windows 10 (VirtualBox)

I checked the commit (8b45bddb) and it's the right one (tagged as 0.4.15) so it looks like it's just a matter of it having been built as a pre-release.

I asked @chriseth about it earlier and he said that it's fine to just replace the zip on the release page with a new, correctly built one. We should also update [solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.15+commit.8b45bddb.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/windows-amd64/solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.15+commit.8b45bddb.zip) in solc-bin to match.

BTW, we had one report about 0.4.15 failing to build on Windows: #8815. If it builds fine for us, I think we should close that issue unless/until some more concrete feedback is provided.

Tagging @christianparpart, since he is the one working on Windows builds right now.

Thanks for handling this! And more generally for all your work with improving availability of binaries, it's much appreciated :pray:

Just a side note: some of the workarounds I needed to build 0.4.15 on MacOS might apply to the Windows version too. See https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/53
