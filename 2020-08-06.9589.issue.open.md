# [\#9589 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9589) `open`: Replace `bool DeclarationRegistrationHelper::visit(...)` by a more generic visitor like in the Scoper

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-08-06 15:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9589):

The Scoper now does most of the work of the DeclarationRegistrationHelper - we should remove the asserts in the latter and make its behaviour rely on the ground work done by the Scoper - potentially also using a generic visit function like in the Scoper.
