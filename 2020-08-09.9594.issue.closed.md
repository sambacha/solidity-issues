Currently our binaries depend on a bunch of msvc*dll's and I think we are currently actually even shipping the wrong ones in the release archives (32-bit instead of 64-bit dlls with 64-bit executables; not sure that'd actually work or people just happen to have the correct dlls installed globally instead). If possible, statically linking might be nicer.

Might work with
https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.15/prop_tgt/MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY.html

We need to investigate whether there's any potential issues or disadvantages with this.
Especially, this might have unexpected interactions with whatever version of boost we're linking against.

If static linking is *not* possible for whatever reason, we should have cmake decide which DLLs to package, i.e. add
https://github.com/ekpyron/solidity/pull/12/files#r467897986
and have whatever CI script packs the release do this based on a cmake install instead of manually copying.

@cameel is this done?

Yeah, I think that @ekpyron's #9811 covers that.
