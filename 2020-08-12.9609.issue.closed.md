**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

**Question: should there be a pragma for enabling ABIEncoderV1?**

Should track here what is needed to achieve this: TBA

I could see us enabling V2 in 0.8.0 but keeping V1 for another major release and only dropping it in 0.9.0.

Hopefully, we'll have proper fuzzing against the Isabelle implementation soon. It'd be much safer to only default to it, once we can properly fuzz it.

I'm actually not too worried about correctness, I'm more worried about increased gas costs.

We could have a pragma to set the abi coder to v1, and enable v2 by default.

Could have a pragma like `pragma ABICoder V1` and `pragma ABICoder V2` and we default to V2 if not set?

Discussion:

 - `pragma abicoder v1`
 - `pragma abicoder v2` (default from 0.8)
 - `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2` generates warning.

Support in 0.7.x already:

 - `pragma abicoder v1`
 - `pragma abicoder v2`

I really wish we could remove the `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2`, and not wait until 0.9.0 to do so :wink:

I'll wait with this until some more tests are extracted.
