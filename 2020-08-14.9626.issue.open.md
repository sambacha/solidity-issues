Came up in the discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9622

That issue has quite a specific context, but this can be an issue in general. I don't think this can be done perfectly, but in a situation like
```
{
  let x := 0
  // a lot of variables
  let _1 := 0x20
  sstore(0, mload(_1))
  // last use of the lot of variables - so they could be popped if not for ``_1``
  sstore(2, x) // x may be unreachable because of this.
  sstore(1, mload(_1))
}
```

It would be much better not to have CSE unify ``_1`` and keep it at

```
{
  let x := 0
  // a lot of variables
  sstore(0, mload(0x20))
  // last use of the lot of variables - so they *will* be popped afterwards
  sstore(2, x) // x is now reachable
  sstore(1, mload(0x20))
}
```
