**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Abstract

Tracks support for the following sub-issues
  - ~~[x] #9674 Install antlr4 jar and c++ runtime package from source in `Dockerfile.ubuntu1604.clang.ossfuzz`~~
  - ~~[x] #9675 Generate antlr parser visitor for every CI build/alternatively check in auto-generated files into the Solidity repo~~
  - ~~[ ] #9676 Derive an antlr mutator class from the auto generated antlr visitor class~~
  - [ ] #9677 Add mutations for all aspects of antlr4 grammar (this will probably span a few months)

## Motivation

Currently, the solidity parser fuzzer `solc_noopt_ossfuzz` feeds pseudo-random input to the compiler.
This is augmented with a [dictionary of solidity keywords][] and [an initial set of test files][]
Although this setup is pretty good at finding bugs (mostly ICEs related to parsing solidity), it is inefficient because of a lack of grammar awareness.

This is an umbrella issue to track support for a grammar aware solidity fuzzer.
The key idea is to leverage existing [antlr4 grammar][] towards targeted mutations of test input *in addition to* pseudo-random mutations.
The hope is that this finds bugs quicker because the likelihood of generating parseable input is greater than pseudo-random alone.

## Specification

- ~~Generate antlr4 c++ visitors for Solidity grammar using antlr4 jar executable~~
- Write base visitor for different aspects of solidity grammar
- Derive from the visitor
- Mutations are added inside derived visitors

## Backwards Compatibility

TBD
