# [\#9720 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9720) `open`: Replace ``commit_hash.txt`` with git archive placeholders (and try also replacing ``prerelease.txt``)
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `build system :building_construction:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-09-01 10:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9720):

The github source archives are invalid in that they are lacking proper ``commit_hash.txt`` and ``prerelease.txt`` files and we instead have to manually pack another source archive, which is confusing and error-prone.

The github source archive is created with ``git archive`` and https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_export_subst would allow us to create a ``commit_hash.txt`` file with one of the placeholders like https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt-emHem

Then our build scripts could check if the ``commit_hash.txt`` contains that placeholder and assume it's a git checkout and determine the hash using ``git`` and otherwise assume it's a release archive and that ``commit_hash.txt`` contains the proper commit hash.

``prerelease.txt`` could be replaced for example by inspecting the top of the changelog - or maybe https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt-emdem can be used to check for tags in the decorators.

I think we should also document the mechanism in the docs as a part of this task. It will become less necessary to do this manually but the mechanism is still not obvious and we should have a place with an explanation to point people to.

The script that currently generates these files (and the source tarball) is [`create_source_tarball.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/create_source_tarball.sh).

Apparently there's an additional use case not mentioned in the issue description:

@ekpyron 
> It would be nice if checking out a release tag via git would build a release without user interaction.

Do we want that as a part of this too? I assumed it's only about github's source packages and that we're just going to keep the current system outside of that usage. If we do want `prerelease.txt` and `commit_hash.txt` to be automatically populated we probably should use git hooks for that.

Here's what I think we should do for this issue:
1) Update our scripts and cmake config to treat the file with a placeholder the same way as if the file did not exist at all. Do not try to get the right value automatically when the file is being read and do not fill out the template automatically outside of `git archive`.
    - This way anyone just checking out the repo and building without touching these files will still get the same behavior as now (i.e. always a pre-release build).
2) Provide a script that gets the right values and fills out the templates.
    - Users can easily run it to get a release build after checking out a tag.
3) (Optional) Provide a [`post-checkout`](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_post_checkout) hook so that it's easy to have your repo configured for git to run the script automatically on every checkout. The thing with hooks is that they are not installed automatically when you clone a repo. So I'd do it like this:
    - Create the hook in `scripts/git-hooks/post-checkout`. The hook should simply call the script from (2).
    - Create a script called `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`. It would copy this hook (and any other hooks we decide to add in the future) to the hook dir (i.e. the dir returned by `git rev-parse --git-path hooks`).

So after extensive discussion with @cameel I think we arrived at the following conclusion regarding the prerelease logic:

- We create a ``prerelease.txt`` file in the repository, but not in the repository root. I suggest ``cmake/prerelease.lock``. The contents can be something like ``If this file is present, a prerelease will be built by default. You can override this with cmake options ...<mention cmake options below>...``
- We use [export-ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive#Documentation/git-archive.txt-export-ignore), s.t. this file will not be part of the github source archive.
- If  ``cmake/prerelease.lock`` exists, we build a prerelease by default, so ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake``
   sets ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` to ``develop.<date>``.
- If  ``cmake/prerelease.lock`` does not exist, we build a release by default, so ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake`` sets ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` to empty.
- If an old-style ``prerelease.txt`` file exists in the repository root, we raise a fatal cmake error, explaining the new mechanism.

Additionally, we want to provide cmake options to override this default behaviour:

- We provide a new cmake string option ``SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING`` which can be used to override the prerelease string, i.e. the value of ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` in ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake`` (i.e. if ``SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING`` is non-empty, we use its content as ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE``)
- We provide a new cmake boolean option ``SOL_FORCE_RELEASE`` to force a release build (empty ``SOL_VERSION_PRERELEASE`` in ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake`` even if ``cmake/prerelease.txt`` exists). If this option is true, ``SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING`` needs to be unset/empty.
- We use the cmake string option ``SOL_COMMIT_HASH`` to replace the `commit_hash.txt` file we've been using so far. If ``SOL_COMMIT_HASH`` is non-empty, we use its content and ignore the file, otherwise, if the file exists and actually contains a commit hash, we use that hash. Otherwise we set it to the default value.

When it's done:
- Document the new cmake options under [Building from Source](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source). Also include a note explaining how the mechanism worked until now.
- Remember to update CI and scripts to use the new mechanism.

**EDIT by @cameel**: Updated with my suggestions from the chat.
**EDIT by @cameel**: Renamed all options to use `SOL_` prefix (rather than `SOLC_`). I noticed that the original description was mixing these two and having both `SOL_COMMIT_HASH`and `SOLC_COMMIT_HASH` at the same time is just asking for bugs.
**EDIT by @cameel**: Changed the part about `commit_hash.txt`.

The ``commit_hash.txt`` logic can stay as already done in the PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12717. (This is: the file is checked in with a pattern, which is replaced by the hash on ``git archive``. If the file contains that pattern, we use ``git`` to determine ``SOL_COMMIT_HASH``, otherwise we use the file contents)
If we want we can additionally add a cmake option to override it as well.

Note that we will also need to check all release-related scripts and change them for towards the new mechanism.
``scripts/release_ppa.sh`` for example.

We also need to decide if we want to drop the old source archive and make the script just a wrapper over `git archive`. @ekpyron just noticed that they include some extra stuff like the jsoncpp sources. I think we could drop them anyway because they don't include other deps like ranges-v3 and are thus not self-contained but we'll need to discuss that with @chriseth.

If we're not fine with not having dependencies in the source archive, we can drop the entire idea, because there's no way to achieve that with ``git archive``, resp. in github source archives :-). But I'd also say that it's a non-issue - and the fact that nobody ever noticed that range-v3 is *not* packed in there is proof of that.

Even if we don't drop the other archive I think there's still some value in the default one being somewhat usable.

I'm somehow wondering whether we could achieve this without having any magic files like `cmake/prerelease.lock`. Wouldn't it be possible to have all this just managed by CMake?

In general I think that there must be an easy way to use those source tarballs. That means all dependencies should be either included (I think it's not possible, e.g. to always include all boost stuff), or a t least listed in a format, so that an enduser can automatically install them. Maybe we could use something like [`vcpkg`](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) to manage those dependencies better.

Unfortunately the automatically created source archive is not usable without this mechanism. Having this file is the only way we came up with so far to have the source result in a release build automatically. This is because `git archive` used by Github lets us skip files from it but not add them.

> That means all dependencies should be either included (I think it's not possible, e.g. to always include all boost stuff), or a t least listed in a format, so that an enduser can automatically install them.

If they're missing, they get downloaded automatically by cmake. See [`jsoncpp.cmake`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/jsoncpp.cmake) and [`range-v3.cmake`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/range-v3.cmake). Which is exactly why no one noticed so far that ranges-v3 was not included in the old archive.

There's an ongoing discussion on this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8860#issuecomment-932787258. No consensus so far though. Last time I asked, @chriseth was not convinced that introducing such a system for managing dependencies is an improvement over just keeping dependencies to a minimum. And others have varied opinions.

Ah that's true! Somehow I forgot that we have still our build system present in the tarball ;) 

However, I think we don't really have boost managed, and also not z3, right? Both depend on the version installed on the system. I think it would be great to have those also managed by us. I think that would be a point for moving forward with something like `vcpkg`.

Right, boost is a major pain. Personally, I'd be fine with something like `vcpkg` as an option, as long as it integrates with our cmake system and is not required if you prefer to install dependencies in a different way.

We [discussed the PR today on the chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=624c27609bd1c71ecad7f80f). Here's a summary of what we agreed on:
- Building a release must be automatic. Change the rules as follows:
    - If `.git` directory exists and we're on a tagged commit, it's a release
    - If `.git` directory exists and we're not on a tagged commit, it's a pre-release
    - If `.git` directory does not exist and `commit-hash.txt` contains an actual commit hash, it's a release.
    - Otherwise, report an error.
- We do want the overrides (forcing a release build, setting pre-release string and overriding the commit) but they should be used sparingly. With the automatic mechanism they should rarely be needed even in our CI.    
    - To make the PR simpler we can drop `SOL_FORCE_RELEASE` and `SOL_COMMIT_HASH` options (only keep them as variables as they were until now). The magic files are enough.
    - We still need `SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING` option for setting the value for the pre-release string.
        -  It's an error to use it in a release build.
- Source archives need to be tested. We should have at least one job that builds from the source archive. (#12900)

Note that ``.git`` can also be a file instead of a directory in git worktrees.
Also in the ``release_ppa.sh`` script we will need to keep the ``.git`` directory for prerelease ppa builds.

Just in case it helps: I had some local snippets yesterday to see how to robustly check, if we're on a tag and ended up with this:
```
        execute_process(
                COMMAND git tag --points-at HEAD
                OUTPUT_VARIABLE SOL_TAGS OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE ERROR_QUIET
                COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL ANY
        )
        string(REPLACE "\n" ";" SOL_TAGS "${SOL_TAGS}")
        list(FILTER SOL_TAGS INCLUDE REGEX "^v[0-9]+[.][0-9]+[.][0-9]+$")
        if(SOL_TAGS)
                message("Release tag!")
        else()
                message("Not a release tag!")
        endif()
```
Not sure that's the best way to do it, but maybe it helps as a basis.
