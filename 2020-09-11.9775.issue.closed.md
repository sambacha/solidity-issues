# [\#9775 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9775) `closed`: output line number for unimplemented feature when compileing solc

When we use "solc --ir contract.sol" to compile a contract, it will emit _UnimplementedFeatureError_. 

However, there is no indication in which line of the solidity file the error is. 

Is it possible to hint which line the unimplemented feature exists so we can examine detailed features manually?

Pull request #9776 should implement your feature request. Can you provide some source code so that I can cross-check that it works for your case?

Of course. There are [three solidity source code](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PMME2dLxRMgx0lNIaMWrFDriZQVGP9t8?usp=sharing) files which emit _UnimplementedFeatureError_ during compilation .

That is great. Is this patch merged on master branch already? How can we use the fix?
Thank you!
