# [\#9788 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9788) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Handle nonlinear arithmetic better

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-09-12 11:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9788):

Trying to run it on this code from UniswapV2:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
pragma solidity >=0.6.0;

// a library for performing various math operations

library Math {
    function min(uint x, uint y) internal pure returns (uint z) {
        z = x < y ? x : y;
    }

    // babylonian method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method)
    function sqrt(uint y) internal pure returns (uint z) {
        if (y > 3) {
            z = y;
            uint x = y / 2 + 1;
            while (x < z) {
                z = x;
                x = (y / x + x) / 2;
            }
        } else if (y != 0) {
            z = 1;
        }
    }
}
```

The first statements fail on z3 (4.8.8):
```

I tried doubling the z3 resource limit, but nothing.

The CHC solver has problems with nonlinear arithmetic. I have two ideas to make that better atm:

- when one of the division/multiplication/mod operands is a constant, we should create the expression directly with the constant instead of assigning it to the ast node expr_smth
- replace div and mod by the slack vars version also used in the wrapping logic in SMTEncoder

Latest develop:
```
Warning: CHC: Division by zero might happen here.
  --> u.sol:18:22:
   |
18 |                 x = (y / x + x) / 2;
   |                      ^^^^^

Warning: CHC: Overflow (resulting value larger than 2**256 - 1) might happen here.
  --> u.sol:18:22:
   |
18 |                 x = (y / x + x) / 2;
   |                      ^^^^^^^^^
```

In this case I think we can't also expect these to be solved because they depend on a nonlinear invariant.
