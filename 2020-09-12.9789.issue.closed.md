# [\#9789 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9789) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Support type conversion of literals (i.e. address(0))

Type conversions are not fully implemented and it may take a while until they are fully supported, but the above special case is so common and it should be easy to support, I'd suggest we make an exception here.

We could easily support address(constant), address(this)

Yes, all that would be nice, and they seem to be a low hanging fruit.
