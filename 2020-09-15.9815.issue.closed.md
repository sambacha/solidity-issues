It looks like `FunctionType::returnParameterTypesWithoutDynamicTypes()` is returning a parameter for which `isDynamicallyEncoded()` is true.

This looks straightforward to debug and fix so I'm going to take it. I could use a short break from the other ABI encoder bug where I have to play whack-a-mole with failing test cases :)

Fix: #9819.

Turns out that `returnParameterTypesWithoutDynamicTypes()` was checking the type using `isDynamicallySized()`, which is not recursive and only checks the outer array. Changing it to `isDynamicallyEncoded()` fixes the problem.

I also tried to review other uses of `isDynamicallySized()` in our code to make sure there are no similar errors. It's used a lot though and all uses in `Types` and `TypeChecker` were fine so I gave up on that in the end.
