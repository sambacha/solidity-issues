**Hi, everyone!**
Please, advice me. 
How to fix this error in 'function endSale', when compile smart contract on remix.ethereum.org?


TypeError: "send" and "transfer" are only available for objects of type "address payable", not "address". admin.transfer(address(this).balance);
^------------^


This TypeError has appeared when I have changed old pragma solidity Version 0.4.21 to new pragma solidity >=0.7.1 in the smart contract.

COMPILER v0.7.1+commit.f4a555be and pragma solidity >=0.7.1;
LANGUAGE: Solidity
EVM VERSION: compiler default

**Part of the Code of the smart contract pragma solidity v0.4.21**:

```
    function endSale() public {
      require(msg.sender == admin);
      admin.transfer(address(this).balance);
    } 
      
}
```

_Thank you, for advance!_

Basically, there are two types : `address` v/s `address payable`

An `address payable` can receive ether while `address` cannot. In a nutshell, we can transfer ether to variable defined as `address payable` while the variable declared as `address` cannot receive ether.

To make an address payable, you can use the keyword `payable` before the variable name of an address type to enable it to receive ether.

Hope this helps !

To fix it, you can use `msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);`
