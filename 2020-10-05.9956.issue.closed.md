I have just noticed that the nightly build action in [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin) has been failing for three days in a row now: [1](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/runs/1201552073?check_suite_focus=true), [2](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/runs/1204181256?check_suite_focus=true), [3](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/runs/1206816217?check_suite_focus=true).

The output suggests that it's being killed by github.

I suspect it's either running out of memory or out of time and the former seems more likely. I just ran `./update` locally and RAM usage peaks at 11.4 GB. It's somewhere around 10 GB right about the point where it fails on github.

By the way, I expected to get notifications about failed runs but I didn't get any. I do get them in my fork. Did anyone get them?

So, https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/58 is just a workaround but should lower the memory usage enough to work in the short term.

For a long-term solution, we need something like [async-pool](https://github.com/rxaviers/async-pool) but one that works with `map()`. [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com) supposedly can do that but is a bit heavy just for our use case.

Alternatively, being able to run IPFS hashing synchronously would help too.

In the end I solved the problem in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/105 without the need for an extra library. With that PR memory usage should go down to something around 350 MB and we should even be able to switch to a `small` machine in CI.
