# [\#9981 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9981) `closed`: [SMTChecker] BMC reports warnings in files without the SMTChecker pragma
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

## Steps to Reproduce
`b.sol`
```solidity
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
import "./a.sol";

contract E is C {
    function foo() public view {}
}
```

`a.sol`
```solidity
contract C {
    function get() external pure {
        uint a = 1;
        a -= 2;
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Warning: BMC: Underflow (resulting value less than 0) happens here.
 --> a.sol:4:9:
  |
4 |         a -= 2;
  |         ^^^^^^
Note:
Counterexample:
  <result> = (- 1)
  a = 1

Note: Callstack:
Note:
```

Expected: it should not report the warning since it pertains to `a.sol` which does not have the pragma.

Since `pragma` is being deprecated I'd say we can close this.
