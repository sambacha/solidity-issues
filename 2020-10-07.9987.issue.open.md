# [\#9987 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9987) `open`: Set up IPNS names for list files from solc-bin
**Labels**: `solc-bin`

Related to #9935 and #9258.

One [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/) name pointing at a directory containing all the lists would be the most convenient option for users but that requires extra post-processing on the computer hosting the files to create the directory. Having separate IPNS names would be acceptable too though not as good.

We're considering also hosting a Brotli-compressed version of every binary (with `.bs` extension) on IPFS only (i.e. not committed to `solc-bin`). To make these compressed bnaries discoverable we'd create corresponding lists (e.g. `list.bs.json`). We should have IPNS names for those too.
