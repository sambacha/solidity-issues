**Labels**: `feature`

It will allow defining public state variables of array types.
For example in #9714 there is `address[] public owners` which fails because of missing this feature.

Are you sure this is because of the getter? It should not try to read full arrays.

It actually fails in `readFromStorage` for `bytes` Array which is inside of struct 
```
struct Transaction {
    address destination;
    uint value;
    bytes data;
    bool executed;
}
```
when generating getter for `mapping (uint => Transaction) public transactions;`

Works on latest develop.
