# [\#10160 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10160) `closed`: Out of storage slots should be an error

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=cc7b2e76c56456ff05e23fa5ca044e4a461b2eb1&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) opened issue at [2020-10-30 01:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10160):

## Description

Creating a contract that uses too much storage creates undefined behavior and should be disallowed.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 7.0.4

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.7.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2; // Required for Diamond Standard

contract Bursting {
    uint[2^256] public mammoth;
    uint public flea;
}

contract Bursting2 {
    uint[2^255] public mammoth;
    uint[2^255] public mammoth2;
    uint[2^255] public mammoth3;
    uint public flea;
}

contract Bursting3 {
    uint[2^257] public mammoth;
}
```

## Discussion

Each of these must certainly be an error.

## Follow on work

Also, I think it is a good idea to mark any fixed-length array with length > 2^128 as a warning. That attack is well-known and easy for the compiler to detect.

There are already warnings for these. I think you came across this annoying thing that `^` means XOR and `**` means raising to the power in Solidity :wink:

I think your examples should trigger the warning with e.g. `2**257`.

Whupps, my bad on that! :-p

Thanks for the fix.
