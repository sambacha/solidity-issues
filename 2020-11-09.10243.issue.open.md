Currently `dataoffset`/`datasize` return i64, however the wasm memory model is 32-bit currently and the Ewasm `codecopy`/`extcodecopy`/etc host functions also deal with 32-bits.

Are you looking for an issue to work on or are you specifically interested in fixing this because you want to use the ewasm target?

more so looking for an issue to work on (not necessarily the ewasm target) but asked for this issue as it is labeled g.f.i.

We're currently not actively working on the ewasm backend so if you want to contribute, I'd recommend a different issue. Here are some suggestions:
