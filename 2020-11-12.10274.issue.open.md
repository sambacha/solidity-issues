(This issue is splitting up #8847.)

> Some options available to the standard-json format do not seem to be available as CLI flags. I'm missing in particular source mappings for yul which was introduced only for the json options in #8378. It would be nice if feature parity between CLI flags and json opts was pursued as a general rule.

CLI has no equivalent for `evm.bytecode.linkReferences` and `evm.deployedBytecode.immutableReferences` outputs from Standard JSON.

Another thing are all the outputs available in assembly mode in Standard JSON. #12074 allows selecting outputs in assembly mode but does not add anything beyond what compiler was already printing.
