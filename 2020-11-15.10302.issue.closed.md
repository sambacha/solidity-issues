Solidity 0.7.4.

```solidity
contract Test
    struct Foo {
        uint a;
        uint b;
    }
    
    Foo public _f;
        
    function doStuff() external {
        Foo memory  memFoo = Foo({a: 1,  b: 2});
        foo(memFoo);
        
        Foo storage storagefoo = _f;
        foo(storagefoo); // TypeError: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
    }
    
    function foo(Foo memory f) internal {
        f.a = f.a + 1;
    }
    
    function foo(Foo storage f) internal {
        f.a = f.a + 1;
    }
}
```
If _data location_ is not part of the function selector calculation, why does the compiler allow the above declarations ? Shouldn't it throw some sort of declarationError ? Perhaps it's interpreted as function overloading by the compiler and that's why it doesn't complain until you try to use the last declaration ?
I think it's especially confusing because the compiler will only complain if you try to use the function that has been declared last.

The compiler is not complaining because it's an internal function. Even though the selector would be the same, those functions are never part of the ABI.

@hrkrshnn Thx for the answer, you are right (totally goofed there) - So, regardless of that, even if they are just two jumps why allow the declaration if the compiler will complain anyway when trying to use both functions ? Does it have a purpose ?

Good question. 

Interestingly, the following compiles

```solidity
struct Foo {uint a;}
contract C {
	function f(Foo memory foo) internal {
	}

	function f(Foo storage foo) internal {
	}

	function g() public {
		f(Foo(1));
	}
}
```

However, we have problems with calling the function which has storage as argument. Maybe this really is a bug.

```solidity
struct Foo {uint a;}
contract C {
	Foo test;
	function f(Foo memory foo) internal {
	}

	function f(Foo storage foo) internal {
	}

	function g() public {
                // Error: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
		f(test);
	}
}

```

The overload resolution allows implicit conversions. Ranking direct matches higher has been planned for a long time, but since nobody complained in years, it was not implemented: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1256
