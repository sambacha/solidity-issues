# [\#10306 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10306) `closed`: [SMTChecker] BMC engine reports false positives with function calls in the implicit constructor
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Here is a simple example:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
    uint x = initX();
    uint y = initY();

    function initX() internal pure returns (uint) {
        return 42;
    }

    function initY() internal view returns (uint) {
        assert(x == 42);
        return x;
    }
}
```

Here is the output of the BMC engine (`--model-checker-engine BMC`):

```
Warning: BMC: Assertion violation happens here.
  --> bmc_bug2.sol:12:9:
   |
12 |         assert(x == 42);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Counterexample:
   = 0
  x = 43
  y = 0

Note:
```
The  first report is expected because BMC analyzes the method `initY` as standalone.
But the second report is from the analysis in the context of the `constructor` call and there BMC should have all the information to prove the assertion correct.

The description of the problem has been updated, the previous example did not take into account the fact that BMC analyzes methods in isolation.
