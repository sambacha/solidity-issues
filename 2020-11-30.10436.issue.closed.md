## Description

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract A {
        mapping(string=>uint) map;
        function f(string memory s, uint x) public {
                map[s] - x;
        }
}
```

throws a segmentation fault due to out-of-bounds read

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/a5a560e163c25044412b7ed6c867a8bd5cfb26f6/libsolutil/FixedHash.h#L117

It looks like `_c.m_data[i]` is responsible for the out-of-bounds read.

## Environment

- Compiler version: breaking

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc test.sol
```

preferably with valgrind/ASan

This is actually not crashing for me on develop/breaking. It also seems `operator<` won't compile when comparing differently sized FixedHashes so not sure how would an overread happen.

@axic That's strange, it still seg faults for me locally. Created a draft PR with the test to see what happens upstream. You can view it here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10452

I think @leonardoalt @cameel and I are just hitting this in various situations.
I think it's present in ``Release`` or ``RelWithDebInfo`` builds that don't link against z3 nor cvc4. Maybe only statically linked once,  that's what looked at so far, but not yet sure. That includes ~~https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.7.4/solc-static-linux~~ https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.7.5/solc-static-linux, that is the static linux release for ~~0.7.4~~ 0.7.5 and is still present on develop.
EDIT: I actually meant 0.7.5, in fact it **doesn't** happen on 0.7.4, as https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10436#issuecomment-738314748 points out.

It also includes 0.7.5.

I have a large set of changes to FixedHash locally, but the first step #10448 is waiting for reviews.

Pretty sure https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10494 fixes this (so it's rather unrelated to FixedHash itself).

@leonardoalt Don't we need to merge #10452 now?

Sure, we can merge that. The segfault wasn't related to that test specifically though, it was more general

What we definitely still need (and why the answer to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10452#issuecomment-738995612 would be "no" ;-)), is changing our test runs, s.t. smt checker tests are at least compiled somewhere where there are no solvers available (instead of just being skipped entirely in such cases).
