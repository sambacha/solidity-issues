# [\#10439 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10439) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Bitwise operations on FixedBytes are buggy
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
    function f() public pure {
        // ffff0000 in bytes4
        bytes4 x = ~bytes4(hex"ffff");
        assert(x == 0xffff0000); // fails
        assert(x == 0x0000ffff); // holds
    }
}
```

The assertions however have the opposite behavior due to FixedBytes being interpreted as right-aligned numbers and not adjusted before an operation.

Actually, the problem is not in the bitwise operation, it is already in the conversion from `hex StringLiteral` to `FixedBytes`.

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
    function f() public pure {
        assert(bytes4(hex"0000ffff") == bytes4(hex"ffff")); // should fail
        assert(bytes4(hex"ffff0000") == bytes4(hex"ffff")); // should hold
    }
}
```

SMTChecker currently reports the opposite result in both assertions.
