Right now the ewasm tests are not running with `--optimize`, due to the following problem:

```
Executing with wabt...
[0] getCallValue 0
[0] codeCopy 40 d0 1f78
[0] finish 40 1f78
wabt (verifyContract): type mismatch in local.set, expected [i64] but got [i32]
wabt (verifyContract): OnLocalSetExpr callback failed
Module failed to load.
```

I thought #8240 fixed this, but perhaps it was the one introducing it? :)

It seems that builtins returning i32 are still considered i64 for some reason, i.e. 
```
    (import "ethereum" "getCallDataSize" (func $eth.getCallDataSize (result i32)))
...
    (local $_1 i64)
...
            (local.set $_1 (call $calldatasize_2126))
```

Or the other possibility is that locals are all defined as i64.

I think the problem may be that `TypeInfo` is used for tracking types of locals, but that only works on fully disambiguated sources and in wasm after the polyfill that requirement is not fulfilled.
