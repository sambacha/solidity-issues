<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

The type name `bytes0000000032` is valid. I expect that leading zeroes should be disallowed, otherwise they might make people think that octal-formatted integers are permitted for sizing types (e.g. `bytes040` is disallowed and not interpreted as `bytes32`). Really, the fact that these numbers are not treated as octal is entirely an artifact of `boost::lexical_cast<int>`, as used [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/liblangutil/Token.cpp#L133).

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): ?
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): ?
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ?
- Operating system: macOS

## Steps to Reproduce

Use zero-prefixing in sized types, such as `bytes032`.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;
contract MyContract {
    bytes0000000032 x;
}
```

## Possible Remediation

```c++
int parseSize(string::const_iterator _begin, string::const_iterator _end)
{
  if (_begin == _end || '0' == *_begin)
    return -1;

  try
  {
    int m = boost::lexical_cast<int>(boost::make_iterator_range(_begin, _end));
    return m;
  }
  catch(boost::bad_lexical_cast const&)
  {
    return -1;
  }
}
```
