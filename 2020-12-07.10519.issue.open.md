# [\#10519 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10519) `open`: Run SMT (or all) tests in absence of solvers to check the smtlib interface.
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Doing so would have caught https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10436, resp. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10494

We can either add some special run for this or we can just not skip the tests entirely if there is no solver, but just ignore the expectations.

(ping @leonardoalt for additional comments, if any)

We could actually run *all* our test files in general with the smtlib engine - it should be fast enough and would catch ICEs in the encoding part at least.

Running it on all tests will also be much easier when we replace the pragma with a command-line flag.
