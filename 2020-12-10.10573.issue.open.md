Some fuzzers are built on every CI run, while others only on `b_ossfuzz`. Because of this the libfuzzer headers are not available and we have to resort to manual prototypes. Would be nice to only build all the fuzzers on `b_ossfuzz` and clean them up from warnings (such as `-Wno-sign-conversion`, etc).

We could by the way also enable all the warnings for the fuzzing builds, if we used cmake's mechanism to declare declare the offending generated headers as ``SYSTEM`` headers, for which warnings will be ignored.
