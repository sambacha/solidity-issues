# [\#10596 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10596) `open`: [SMTChecker] Support some inline assembly

Currently the SMTChecker completely ignores inline assembly.
We could support the simple parts of it.

The various optimizer helpers can be used to track whether code modifies storage or is deterministic.

## Current situation

The current situation with inline assembly is the following (taken from #10835):
- If any Solidity-level local variable is assigned in the assembly, it is considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.
- If the block modifies storage (e.g., using sstore), all storage variables are considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.
- If the block modifies memory (e.g., using mstore), all memory variables are considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.
- In all other cases, the variables keep their value from just before the assembly block.

This (greatly) over-approximates the actual behaviour of the code in the assembly block, but at least it is a safe over-approximation (it prevents false negatives).

## Possible improvements
One way to improve the analysis would be to track the actual values assigned to variables inside the assembly block.
However, beside small obstacles (assembly is not type-safe, so it allows assignments with LHS and RHS being of different type), the analysis is not trivial if the assignment is inside a control-flow branch. To analysed that situation correctly, it would be necessary to have a proper control-flow analysis of the assembly. (This goes into the direction of proper CHC encoding of Yul).
