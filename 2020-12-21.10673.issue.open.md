# [\#10673 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10673) `open`: Take termination into account for RedundantAssignEliminator
**Labels**: `optimizer`

In the following code, the assignment `a := 2` should be optimized out (which allows further optimizations) because `a` is never read again after that assignment.
```
{
  let a := 1
  if calldataload(0) {
    a := 2
    stop()
  }
  if eq(a, 2) { sstore(0, 1) }
}
```

The same should be true if `stop()` is replaced by `leave`.

The solution here could be to mark undecided assignments as "unused" whenever we encounter a statement that terminates.

Please check that everything still works if there is "garbage" after the terminating statement. In this case, the result does not have to be optimal (there should be another step that should clean that up), but it should at least not be incorrect.
