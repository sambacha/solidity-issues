Good catch, the coinbase does not need to be actually payable, since the "coinbase transaction" is not executing any code.

there are use cases where you would want to send eth to the miner

@thegostep given your last comment, are you suggesting it should or should not be payable?

I think it should default to non-payable for consistency but still work with `payable(block.coinbase).transfer()`

I guess this should have been changed in 0.8.0 along with the types of the other addresses. Do we consider it a bug or just a missing feature?

It doesn't actually hurt anyone, so I would just schedule for 0.9
