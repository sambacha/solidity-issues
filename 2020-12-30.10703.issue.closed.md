# [\#10703 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10703) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Missing type constraints on transaction variables in contract deployment phase.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-12-30 13:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10703):

The following examples current produce false reports from SMTChecker. The reason are missing type constraints on transaction variables in contract deployment phase.

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
	uint x;

	constructor() {
		x = block.timestamp + 0;
	}
}
```
produces
```
Warning: CHC: Overflow (resulting value larger than 2**256 - 1) happens here.
Counterexample:
x = 0


Transaction trace:
constructor()
 --> tx2.sol:7:7:
  |
7 | 		x = block.timestamp + 0;
  | 		    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```
even though the overflow is not possible.

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
	address owner;

	constructor() {
		owner = msg.sender;
        	assert(owner >= address(0));
	}
}
```
produces 
```
Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
Counterexample:
owner = (- 1)



Transaction trace:
constructor()
 --> tx.sol:8:9:
  |
8 |         assert(owner >= address(0));
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```
even though the assertion is safe and the CEX `owner = (- 1)` does not make sense.
