# [\#10749 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10749) `open`: [SMTChecker] Add balance/block constraints between transactions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-01-12 15:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10749):

Between the end of a tx and the beginning of the next tx run by a contract:
- it's balance needs to be >= the previous balance
- block.timestamp must be >=
- block.number must be >=

Currently the SMTChecker does not add those constraints.
Anything else?

Why does this have to be true?

Because it can't decrease, but it can increase if it was used as the argument of a `selfdestruct`

Does the block number and block time stamp have to be strictly greater?

Do you want to clarify this?

For new transactions I *think* so, for reentrant calls they should be the same.

This issue is about balance changes where the contract is not called. The only way for that to happen is when its address is used as the `selfdestruct` argument, and therefore the balance can only increase while the contract is idle.
Or what exactly is unclear?

It is not only `selfdestruct`, but the "coinbase transaction too" (e.g. being the mining recipient in a block).

Can you assign that to a contract?

Confirmed yes.
