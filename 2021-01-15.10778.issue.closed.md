# [\#10778 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10778) `closed`: Implement codegen shortcut for address(...).code.length
**Labels**: `feature`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-01-15 13:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10778):

As discussed in #3044, `address(...).code` was implemented in 0.8.0 to do a `extcodecopy`, and `address(...).code.length` to just count the length of that byte array.

Supporting the shortcut to generate `extcodesize` for the `address(...).code.length` expression was postponed after 0.8.0.

It would be useful to implement this soon, otherwise the feature is pretty much useless.
