# [\#10786 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10786) `closed`: [SMTChecker] CHC Show local variables in counterexample

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-01-15 16:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10786):

Currently only state variables are shown in the counterexample, because we use the summary predicate of the function that caused the target fail which doesn't have local variables.
To show the local variables that cause the target fail, we need to traverse the subgraph of the last transaction and find the first summary (1) that has error > 0.
We also need to add a new rule for each function: currently the error condition adds the rule `function_block(...) && local_constraints => function_summary(error, ...)`. Here we won't have access to the last values of local variables that were assigned in `local_constraints`, so we need to change this to
```
function_block(local_vars, state_vars ...) && local_constraints => function_error(error, local_vars, state_vars ...)`
function_error(error,  local_vars, state_vars ...) => function_summary(error, state_vars ...)
```
So after finding (1) (explained above), it should have one child `function_error` where we can collect the local variables.
