# [\#10847 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10847) `closed`: [SMTChecker] False negative with assignment to state variables of reference type

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-01-25 12:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10847):

In the following example:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract A {
	int[] a;
	function f() public {
		require(a.length == 1 && a[0] == 1);
		int[] storage u = a;
		assert(u[0] == 1); // should hold
		int[] memory b = new int[](2);
		a = b;
		assert(u[0] == 1); // should fail
		A.a = b;
		assert(u[0] == 1); // should fail
	}

	function push_v(int x) public {
		a.push(x);
	}
}
```
SMTChecker currently reports assertion violation for the third assertion, but not the second one. The second assertion should also be reported as violated.

The problem is slightly different handling of assignments based on whether or not the contract type is used.
