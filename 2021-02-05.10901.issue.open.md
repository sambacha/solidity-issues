- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).

## Abstract

<!--
Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.
-->

Aim is to compare optimised program behavior with unoptimised program behavior. Let trace T be a proxy for program behavior. At a minimum, trace T must include
  - storage state of host (see #10899 )

TBD. CC @axic @chriseth 

## Motivation

<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->
