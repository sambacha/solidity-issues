Thanks for reporting!
The bug is triggered by the SMTChecker analysis (`pragma experimental SMTChecker;`), but I still haven't checked what exactly causes it.

I reproduced this crash in `0.8.1`, got a different crash in `0.8.2`, but no crash in `develop`.
There has been several fixes regarding crashes in SMTChecker recently
It looks like some of them fixed also this issue.
