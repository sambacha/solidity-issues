# [\#11030 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11030) `open`: [SMTChecker] Use natspec annotation to abstract function

Some contracts use functions like `pow` or `sqrt`, which are pretty hard to verify.
We could use natspec annotations to allow the user to force calls to that function to be abstracted as UF, which might help in some cases:
```
// @ spec-smtchecker abstract
function pow(uint a, uint b) {
  ...heavy stuff...
}
```

Could use `@custom:smtchecker abstract-function` for the time being. @leonardoalt @blishko what do you think? This could be a very useful feature.

Decision on call:
Keep this option in the source, since there might be other ones such as pre/post conditions.

One aspect of this is:
- you can abstract a function as "havoc", that is, just return something nondeterministic https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11334, or
- abstract the function as UF, that is, `a=c /\ b=d => f(a,b) = f(c,d)`
Both are valuable
