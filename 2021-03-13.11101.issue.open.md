## Abstract

Right now, it is rather unclear based on reading the docs here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.2/docs/units-and-global-variables.rst what we can actually use ether units for. 

## Motivation

Adding in more examples of how it can be used. I was specifically interested in how to solve the division/floating point problem in Solidity and was pointed to this section but it is not clear how I can actually use those ether units. 


## Backwards Compatibility

After updating the docs for 8.2, it should be propagated to older versions.

Thanks for your input! We definitely want the docs to be clear so if there's something we can do to improve them, we'll work on that. That being said, I think that the example shows pretty clearly that numbers with these units are just integers:

> assert(1 wei == 1);
> assert(1 gwei == 1e9);
> assert(1 ether == 1e18);
> 
> The only effect of the subdenomination suffix is a multiplication by a power of ten.

I.e. `1 wei` is exactly the same as `1` and `wei` is there just for clarity. `1 gwei` is a shorthand for `1000000000`, etc. There's nothing more to it and it has nothing to do with fixed-point arithmetic (there are no floating-point numbers in Solidity). Even something like `0.000001 ether` is in fact just an integer (equivalent to `1000 gwei` or `1000000000000`).

Could you give some examples of operations where the result you got was counterintuitive? Did you for example assume that `1 ether` means something like `1.0` and lower denominations are fractions? Or maybe that these units are typed and not just equivalent to integers? I think that most of the confusion regarding using these units in calculations results from the assumptions people come with. We could expand on it a bit (and maybe rephrase it if the current phrasing makes things less clear than they could be) but we have to know first which situations are problematic.
