**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

## Description

The "secret" documentation of breaking Sol->Yul code generation changes does not mention two important semantic differences between legacy and new code gen

#### Dirty bits clean up

Dirty bits are not cleaned up if intermediate "dirty" value is read from within an inline assembly block by the legacy code gen, they are cleaned up even within an inline assembly block by the Sol->Yul code gen.

```
contract C {
  function f(uint8 a) public returns(int ret)
  {
    a = ~a;
    assembly {
      ret := a
    }
  }
}
```

If input to the function `f(uint8)` is 21. Outputs from old and new code gen are as follows:

Old: ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffea
New: 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ea

#### Order of expression evaluation

Legacy code gen evaluates an expression right to left, while the new code gen evaluates an expression left to right.

```
contract C {
        function preincr_u8(uint8 a) public pure returns (uint8) {
                return ++a + a;
        }
}
```

When the input 1 is passed to the function `preincr_u8(uint8)`, it returns 3 (`1 + 2`) when compiled via legacy code gen but returns 4 (`2 + 2`) when compiled via new code gen.
