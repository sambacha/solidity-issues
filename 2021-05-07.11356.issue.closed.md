Probably related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11353

Although in contrast to #11353, this code should compile, because the contract is abstract.

An irrelevant question here, I have found several programs trigging the following ICE. Is it a bug, and should I report it? 

Thanks.

Fixed point types are not finished yet, so please do not open an issue, we are still working on it.
