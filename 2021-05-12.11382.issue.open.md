# [\#11382 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11382) `open`: Consider marking potentially non-deterministic tests as "experimental".
**Labels**: `annoys users :cry:`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-05-12 09:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11382):

There are known non-determinism problems with ``yulOptimizerTests/reasoningBasedSimplifier/addmod``, even with a matching version of Z3.
While they are "mostly harmless" to us, this is causing issues for package maintainers, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/122568.

If we can't solve the non-determinism, we should probably either remove the test or introduce a new boost test label like "experimental" that allows to disable tests with issues like that in bulk, the idea being that not having those tests pass is ok for a production build of solidity.
