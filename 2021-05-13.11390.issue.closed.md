# [\#11390 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11390) `closed`: Implement support for London

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-05-13 16:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11390):

Most of the [London](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/london.md) changes will not affect us (based on the [latest testnet](https://github.com/ethereum/eth1.0-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/client-integration-testnets/baikal.md):
- [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)
- [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198)
- [EIP-3529](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529)
- [EIP-3541](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541)

1559 changes gas price / block gas limit calculation, don't think we need to do anything with this.

3198  introduces a new `BASEFEE` opcode, we may want to expose this as `block.basefee`

3529 reduces gas refunds on `selfdestruct` and `sstore`, we may want to update our documentation on this regard.

3541 runtime code starting with the `0xef` byte can not be deployed, we could display a warning for this hypothetical case, but it won't be generated by our assembler anyway.

Need to upgrade to evmc 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ethereum/evmc/releases/tag/v9.0.0) and evmone 0.8.0 (to be released later today). It has support for London/Shanghai, but we do not need to use London yet before it goes live on mainnet.
