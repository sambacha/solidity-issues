# [\#11446 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11446) `closed`: Bad link to Keyword Index from pages inside internals/ section in the docs
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `documentation :book:`

1. Go to one of the documentation pages that have links with `internals/` in the URL. For example [Cleaning Up Variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/variable_cleanup.html).
2. Click the [Keyword Index](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/genindex.html) link in the menu.

Result: the link leads to a page that does not exist. The correct link is https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/genindex.html.

This only happens on those nested pages about internals. Other pages do not have this problem.
