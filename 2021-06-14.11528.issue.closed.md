A test like this is invalid. The target of an external source must be a regular file. Directories are not allowed. In #11579 I made it return a more appropriate error but it's still an error.

I think the actual fix should be to make fuzzer either not generate this kind of test or detect that an error is the expected result here.

Closing since this should no longer be a problem thanks to#11579
