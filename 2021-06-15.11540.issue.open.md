# [\#11540 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11540) `open`: Do not warn about `this` used in constructor if not used to call a function
**Labels**: `annoys users :cry:`

`this` is sometimes necessary to clarify that a function of the current contract is being accessed as an external one. The compiler currently warns about every use of it in a constructor, which drives users away from using it in even innocuous constructs like simply getting a function selector:

```solidity
contract C {
    function ext() external {}
    function pub() public {}

    constructor() {
        this.ext.selector;
        this.pub.selector;
    }
}
```
```
Warning: "this" used in constructor. Note that external functions of a contract cannot be called while it is being constructed.
 --> test.sol:6:9:
  |
6 |         this.ext.selector;
  |         ^^^^

Warning: "this" used in constructor. Note that external functions of a contract cannot be called while it is being constructed.
 --> test.sol:7:9:
  |
7 |         this.pub.selector;
  |
```

This is actually the "correct" way to get the selector (#10905). Sometimes it's also possible to get the selector via unqualified access or via contract name but it does not work in all situations. I think that the compiler should not warn when it's just the selector that's being accessed. 

I think that it might be better to also omit the warning in any case where the function is not being directly called. For example when it's only assigned to a pointer. There are valid situations where such a pointer is only called at runtime so the warning is a bit overzealous:

```solidity
contract C {
    function () external handler;

    constructor(bool useA) {
        if (useA)
            handler = this.a;
        else
            handler = this.b;
    }

    function a() external {}
    function b() external {}

    function test() public {
        handler();
    }
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.5

Can't we just add `selector` to `C.pub`?

We could. @nventuro would probably appreciate that.

But even if we do this, isn't the warning about `this` in `this.C.pub` undesirable?

We talked about this on today's call.
- We're going to suppress the warning when `this` is used to access the selector.
- We should make selector available on public methods even when not accessed through `this`.
- We'll leave the general case of function pointers as is (i.e. with a warning).
