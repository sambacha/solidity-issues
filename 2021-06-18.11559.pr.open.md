Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8973

This PR adds
- support to contract deployment
- user can consider external calls trusted if code is available
The CHC.cpp code doing both these items is rather small, but it depends on a larger Horn encoding change:
Every predicate has the `state` tuple as a parameter, which currently only has one element, an array `balances` that maps `address => uint`.
The encoding change we make here is to add to `state`:
- an array `isActive` that maps `address => bool` representing whether an address is already used by a deployed contract. This is used for contract deployment to make sure different contracts have different addresses.
- a tuple `storage` that represents the storage of every analyzed contract. Since the SMT types are strong and different contracts have different state variables, each element of this tuple `storage` is an array that maps `address => specific_contract_storage_tuple`. The latter then is a tuple that contains the state variables of a contract.

An example of the last part.
Take the contracts
```
contract C { uint x; uint y; }
contract D { address a; address b; }
```
and let's say we have two C's of addresses 1 and 2, and one D of address 3.
The global storage above would be
```
state {
    balances: ...,
    isActive: {1: true, 2: true, 3: true},
    storage: {
        1: contract_C_storage_tuple { 5, 6 }, // values are arbitrary here
        2: contract_C_storage_tuple { 7, 8 },
        3: contract_D_storage_tuple { 0x01, 0x02 }
    }
}
```

The basic idea of the PR is to use this `storage` as a synchronization buffer when external calls are made.
Example:
```
contract Ext {
    uint e;
    function f() public { ... }
}

contract Test {
    uint x;
    function g(Ext e) public {
        ...
        e.f();
    }
}
```

While analyzing `Test.g`, we use the state variables that are already in the predicate as usual. That is a lot more efficient for the solver since we avoid unnecessary datatypes.
Before the call `e.f()`, we
- write the current state variables of `Test` to `state.storage`,
- read the current state variables of `Ext` from `state.storage` into `summary_f(state_vars, state_vars')` and add that as a constraint, which in practice means `Ext.f` "runs".

When we're back  at `Test`, after `e.f`, we
- read the state variables of `Test` from `state.storage` into the current predicate variables
- write the state variables of `Ext` from `state_vars'` above into `state.storage`.

Of course if the called function is view/pure/staticcall we don't need the post step above.

@ekpyron some of the tests might be failing due to nondeterminism on the invariants (I'm on it) but can already be reviewed. The new commits you didn't review yet are https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11559/commits/1093adde084167c3556f3db2ce4f276819150ed2 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11559/commits/a0d9ffb39b4b3ddd1d32466a9d8f2a32d9353341

> Just random comment: this won't catch (this).f() and the like... then again, syntactically, you can't catch C c = this; c.f() anyways, so...

These won't trigger the "external call to this", but should actually work in the trusted mode. Will add those tests too.

In case you haven't seen: osx nondeterminism unfortunately seems to persist... looking through the new commits now.

I'm wondering about how ``address`` casts work with all this:
Does stuff like this work at all?
```
contract D {
        constructor(uint _x) { x = _x; }
	uint public x;
}

contract C {
	function f() public {
                address d = address(new D(42));
		assert(D(d).x() == 42); // should hold
	}
}
```
If this works, then I wonder about state variables of address types and non-deterministic calls. If it doesn't work, then I guess it doesn't matter too much...

lol at first I actually didn't expect this to work but it does.
So I do need to add `address` to the commit that havocs things

So what happens for
```
contract D {
	uint public x;
	function setD(uint _x) public { x = _x; }
}

contract C {
	address d;
	constructor() {
		d = address(new D());
		assert(D(d).x() == 0); // should hold
	}
	function f() public view {
		assert(D(d).x() == 0); // should fail
	}
}
```
now?
Not entirely sure, but I think this may require another havok case in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11559/files#r827774621... even though that's rather unfortunate, since it may break stuff just because you have an ``address owner;`` or sth...

@ekpyron I added `address` to the nested types (together with contracts) that should case a contract's storage to be havoc'ed. The new commit is:

The ``address`` havoc part looks good.
