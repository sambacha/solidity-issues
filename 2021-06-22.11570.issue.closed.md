Thanks for reporting but it's not a bug. You're a bit too quick :) The release is currently being prepared and it always takes some time. Publishing the blog post is one of the last steps. That's why the release page on github says "Release in progress - please wait".

If you want to read it already you can take a look at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/pull/142
