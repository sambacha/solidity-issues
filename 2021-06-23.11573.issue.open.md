# [\#11573 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11573) `open`: View-pure checker misses reads from storage pointer variable

```
contract Storage {
    struct S { uint x; }
    S t;

    function store(S storage x) internal {
        S memory y = x;
    }
    
    function f() public {
        store(t);   
    }
}
```
Function `store` is considered `pure`. Same if `x` is used in function call conversion to memory. Reading members from `x` is properly detected.

This seems to be far trickier than initially thought. During type checking, we need to store if a variable is converted from storage to memory (we wanted to do that anyway for 'copyof'), but this could be difficult for things like `abi.encode()` where we do not have a particular target type.

Places to check for copying:
 - function call (including struct creation and special functions like bytes.concat and abi.encode)
 - assignment (multi-assignment?)
 - inheritance specifier
 - modifier invocation
 - emit statement
 - revert statement
 - mapping index access
 - state variable declaration
 - regular variable declaration (but maybe only preparatory)
 - `new`
 - return statement
