Originally pointed out by @axic in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11580#discussion_r658959661.

We currently provide an implicit conversion from various "weird" zero literals to fixed bytes, which means this is a perfectly valid call:
```solidity
bytes.concat(0, -0, 0.0, -0.0, 0e10, 0e-10, 0x00, hex"00");
```

Of those all the fixed-point zeros should probably be disallowed. Not sure about `-0` (does it count as a special literal or an expression?) but if it's a distinct literal, maybe it makes sense to disallow it too.

I'd also argue that `0e10` may not have its place as a literal for a bytes type, however IIRC that is parsed in the scanner, so can't do much about it.

I think `bytes3 x = 0` should still be valid.

That one sure. The issue is not about disallowing it. What about `bytes3 x = 0.0` though?

Also, consider this irregularity:
- `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`: implicitly convertible to any fixed bytes.
- `-0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`: implicitly convertible to any fixed bytes.
- `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`: implicitly convertible to `bytes32`.
- `-0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`: not implicitly convertible to fixed bytes.

The third one is fine (I assume it has 32 hex bytes), the first one is, too. So I think there are only cases left that write zero either as negative or as fractional or using scientific notation. If it's too difficult to implement, I would leave it. This is really not such a big deal.

Sounds good to me. Seems in line with that @axic wanted so I'm going to move this to implementation backlog.

Do you think it would be a `good first issue`? Especially given that it's fine to give up if it turns out to be difficult?

Please check the code to see what has to be done without doing it. If it is easy, then it can be a good first issue.
