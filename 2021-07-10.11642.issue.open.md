```

Legacy optimizer does not report and error. Legacy and Sol->Yul without optimization don't report either. Both legacy (with and without opt) and Sol->Yul (without opt) result in a runtime failure due to `int8` overflow inside the constructor.

The constructor always reverts (checked arithmetic), and therefore the `DeadCodeEliminator` removes the code following the `revert`, which includes `setimmutable`.

Not sure what should be done in this case. Perhaps improve the error to say that it's likely that the constructor will always revert?

Yeah, came to that conclusion.

Perhaps the error could say "constructor will always revert". At least that is easier to follow than the somewhat cryptic immutables are unassigned? Just curious if it's always cos of constructor revert though, because if it is not there may be cases where even the new error may not make sense :-)

The same error will be generated for
```
contract C {
uint immutable x;
constructor() {
if (false)  { x = 2; }
}
}
```

Wondering if this could be a warning instead of an error.

Small update: This is not solely a Sol->Yul issue, also happens with the legacy compiler (even without optimization turned on)

```
contract C {
  int8 immutable s4 = 15;
  constructor () {
      for(;;) {}
  }
  function f2() external returns (int8) {
    return s4 / 2;
  }
}
```

```
$ solc test.sol

Hmm, shouldn't it be a requirement that an immutable must always be assigned in the constructor? As opposed to allow the "default value" rule?

But how would that be enforced? One can always have a `setimmutable` inside a conditional branch that will never be reached.

The default value of zero for uninitialized immutable does seem consistent.

Then why this error? If zero-by-default is allowed, then we do not need this special error.

You cannot assign an immutable in a conditional branch. We do not rely on the default value.

This error is about the optimizer removing the `setimmutable` and it is an additional low-level check because the high-level check does not catch all situations.

We can improve the error message.

It happens if you have an infinite loop or a require that always fails before you assign the immutable.
