# [\#11719 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11719) `open`: Tracking unimplemented fixed point features

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13174375?u=52d702cb6bec53b561afa293cf9cd53ef7a63924&v=4" width="50">[hrkrshnn](https://github.com/hrkrshnn) opened issue at [2021-07-29 13:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11719):

- [ ] `type(ufixedMxN).min` and `.max`
- [ ] Error when `ufixedMxN` where `N` is too large to fit into `M` (e.g., `ufixed8x80` is currently allowed.) Controversial: don't implement.
- [x] Check that comparing two rational numbers for equality does not apply rounding before comparison.
- [x] Check that the abi decoder reverts if the input value is out of range for the type (part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11704)
- [x] check that storing and loading from storage works properly (especially truncating sign bits)
- [x] check that getters work properly
- [x] check that rounding is towards zero for precision loss and conversion to integer (also for negative values)
- [x] comparison operators (codegen + tests)
- [x] abi json (fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11825 )

Also https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/409 has some. A fresh issue to track things that come up in PRs.
