London is out, but there is no compiler to write code to use the new `basefee` opcode.

When is 0.8.7 released ?

If you *really* want to use basefee immediately, then the section "Verbatim in Yul" in https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement/ shows how to do it. Note that it's only available in pure Yul, i.e., not via inline assembly.

Closing this. Feel free to reply if you have questions.

Verbatim yul is not an option, but I'll be happy to wait one more day..
