# [\#11822 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11822) `closed`: [UBSan] CI run
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2021-08-19 09:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11822):

While running the undefined behavior sanitizer (UBSan) fuzzer, I noticed that several isoltests fail with a null pointer dereference. I don't know why this does not happen outside of the UBSan build.

Wonder if we should have another couple of CIs: (1) UBSan build; (2) UBSan tests

Example error

```
semanticTests/array/function_array_cross_calls.sol: /src/solidity/libyul/ScopeFiller.cpp:56:55: runtime error: member access within null pointer of type 'std::shared_ptr<const solidity::yul::DebugData>::element_type' (aka 'const solidity::yul::DebugData')
```
