For doing this,

- revert the commit in the breaking branch (there should be a git command to do this specifically).
- run tests using isoltest (see contributing page in the documentation).
- add a description in the changelog.
- write something similar in the (rst) file 0.9.0 breaking changes.
- make a PR that targets breaking branch.

The breaking branch may not be upto date with develop. I'll check and fix this now.
