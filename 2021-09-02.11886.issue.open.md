# The problem:

try/catch construct was added to allow easily handle reverts when calling functions.
However, it gives false sense of security, since there are cases where reverts are "leaked" through

## Example

The following code looks safe, since the call is covered by catch-all try/catch.
But in fact, it reverts

```solidity
interface Istr {
    function retstr() external view returns(string memory);
}

contract Test {
    
    function asd() external {
        try Istr(address(this)).retstr() returns(string memory ret) {
            emit Debug(ret);
        } catch {
            emit Debug('reverted');
            
        }
    }

    function retstr() external  returns (uint) {
        return 1;
    }
    event Debug(string mesg);
}
```

## Root cause
while try/catch does catch all reverts by the external call, it doesn't handle any local handling of the **response**.
The above example receives a "uint" return value, but tries to parse it as dynamic content (string), and the decoder reverts.

There are other cases where the user might use checked arithmetics between the try/catch, which assumes it get caught by "catch"

## Suggested fix

- At a minimum, the return value decoding should not revert  in a try/catch block. otherwise, try/catch can't be trusted when calling unknown contracts, and developers must resort to low-level `address.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(...))` (and manually validate the returned structure before decoding)

In addition, the try/catch model should be updated:
- in case a user specifies a `catch {}` block, it is his expectation that no revert will leak from the "try" block.
- The entire code after the "try" until the "catch" should be "no-revert" - must not generate revert by the compiler itself.
- Instead of reverting, this code should jump to the `catch {}` block 
- Implementing a full "stack unwinding" for revert handling seems unlikely for solidity, so instead I suggest:
   - when compiling methods, mark each method as "may-revert" or "no-revert"
   - Is case the try/catch block calls "may-revert" method,  a compilation error should be generated: `cannot call method X from a try/catch block: the method might revert`
  - the user should then alter his code and call that method outside the try/catch block, or add "unchecked" markers to that method

Related issue: #9592 (try/catch with low-level calls).

The idea behind the current behaviour was that if you end up in the catch-part of the try/catch block, then you know that the call has reverted. I think this is a very important property that we should keep for safety and it is the better tradeoff than the suggested change.

We could add another clause that is only executed on call-related errors (either no code at destination or decoding error):
```
try ... {
} catch ... {
} callError {
} decodeError {
}
```
