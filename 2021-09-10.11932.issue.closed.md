# [\#11932 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11932) `closed`: ICE when the file name in `@use-src` annotation does not match the name of the file passed to `--strict-assembly`
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should report better error`

## Description
If you try to assemble a file using a different name than the one included in the `@use-src` annotation, the compiler crashes. 

There must be some additional factors involved because it only happens in specific circumstances. For example in the example below the problem goes away if I remove any of the annotation or if I do not use `calldataload(0)`.

## Steps to Reproduce
- `input.yul`
    ```yul
    /// @use-src 0:"input.sol"
    object "C" {
        code {
            /// @src 0:0:0
            calldataload(0)
        }
    }
    ```
```bash
solc --strict-assembly input.yul
```
```
Warning: Yul is still experimental. Please use the output with care.
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>'
  what():
Aborted (core dumped)
```
Note that we don't have a handler for `InternalCompilerError`s in assembly mode. #11732 should fix that.

The assertion failure happens at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e28d00a76daa0747f00ffe47cea17862bca55771/libyul/AssemblyStack.cpp#L94

## Environment
- Compiler version: Happens both on 0.8.7 and on the latest code from `develop`.

Example updated. Looks like the `pop()` around `calldataload(0)` makes it not crash. Same if I assign the value to a variable - so this must have something to do with unused stuff remaining on the stack.

I'm unassigning myself again. My initial assessment is that AssemblyStack always assumes that the SourceLocations inside the Yul AST point to the Yul source of AssemblyStack. I think we have to determine inside AssemblyStack if the YulObject has a `@use-src` or not and change its behaviour respectively.

The problem is that when `@use-src` is present,  `DebugData::location` stores Solidity locations and we don't have Yul locations at all. `AssemblyStack` reports errors at Solidity locations and I think this is a bug. But it does not have the Yul location available. I think we need a separate field in `DebugData` for each of these locations.

Note how some errors are missing locations even in cases where there's no crash.

It's not all of them though so apparently the Yul locations are still stored somewhere.
EDIT: apparently this is because the second error in the first example happens at the parsing stage (in `ParserBase.cpp`). Interestingly the first error is missing location despite coming from `AsmParser.cpp`. It's probably because of the location override? I'm adding a second example with an error reported in `AsmAnalysis.cpp`.

### Example: error in the parser
```yul
/// @use-src 0:"input.sol"
object "C" {
    code {
        xyz
    }
}
```
Output on 0.8.6:
```
Error: Call or assignment expected.
 --> /tmp/input.yul:5:5:
  |
5 |     }
  |     ^

Error: Expected end of source but got '}'
 --> /tmp/input.yul:6:1:
  |
6 | }
  | ^
```
Output on 0.8.7:
```
Error: Call or assignment expected.

Error: Expected end of source but got '}'
 --> /tmp/input.yul:6:1:
  |
6 | }
  | ^
```

### Example: error in `AsmAnalysis.cpp`
```yul
/// @use-src 0:"input.sol"
object "C" {
    code {
        let a, b := 1
    }
}
```

Output on 0.8.6:
```
Error: Variable count mismatch for declaration of "a, b": 2 variables and 1 values.
 --> /tmp/input.yul:4:9:
  |
4 |         let a, b := 1
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
Output on 0.8.7:
```
Error: Variable count mismatch for declaration of "a, b": 2 variables and 1 values.
```
