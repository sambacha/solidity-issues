It actually seems to fail everywhere (except for Windows for some reason). In case of emscripten it seems to be because it needs `emcmake` in cmake command. Both ranges and jsoncpp set `CMAKE_COMMAND` for that reason.

I don't know why other platforms fail but it might have something to do with you setting `CMAKE_ARGS` simply to `true`. These other libs have an extensive set of parameters for it.

By the way, maybe it would be better to use `FetchContent` instead as in #11273?

@cameel I actually did `FetchContent` in 5510abd, but it had the same problem.

I'd refrain from rebasing this before the problem is solved though.

I guess this needs to be taken over?
