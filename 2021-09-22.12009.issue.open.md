## Abstract
The compiler does not complain if you use a contract or an interface in places where a fully qualified library name is expected. Such a reference can never work and should be reported as an error.

### Example
```bash
echo 'contract C {}' | solc - --libraries "<stdin>:C=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
```
This does not produce an error even though `<stdin>:C` refers to a contract and not a library.

## Specification
Each fully qualified library name used in `--libraries`/`settings.libraries` that actually exists and refers to something else than a library should be reported as an error. For example in the above:
```
Invalid link reference: '<stdin>:C'. Not a library.
```

If possible, this should work that way not only for contracts but also for other names matching the reference. E.g. structs, enums, errors, events.

## Backwards Compatibility
The code that previously compiled fine with such references will no longer compile so it's a breaking change.

Sounds good!

Moving to implementation backlog then.
