# [\#12245 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12245) `open`: Strengthen natspec parsing

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-11-05 12:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12245):

```
/// what @custom:tag test
contract C {
}
```

This is parsed as `@custom:tag` = `test`, and the `what` is ignored entirely (does not show up as `@notice`/`@dev`).
