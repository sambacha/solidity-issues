# [\#12253 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12253) `open`: Move test cases from SolidityEndToEnd to semanticTests
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-11-08 00:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12253):

There is the `test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` file, which contains a lot of semantic tests.  It is a large monolithic single C++ file, which takes a long time to compile and is hard to maintain.

We want to move as many test cases out to individual files under `test/libsolidity/semanticTests`.  They should be grouped logically, by following the grouping in SolidityEndToEnd.

Have a look at existing test case in both places to see how they operate.

(This was previously designed/discussed in #3486, but creating a new issue to be more helpful.)
