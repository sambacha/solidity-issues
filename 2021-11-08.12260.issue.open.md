# [\#12260 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12260) `open`: Disallow ``codecopy`` in pure functions (and check for other cases)
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

Related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8153 and following https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12256 we should make sure we actually are as strict as we want to be for ``pure`` functions.

In particular, we should disallow ``codecopy`` with 0.9.0, but we should double-check if there is other cases that we should strengthen as well.

Isn't disallowing access to `msg.data` also part of this issue?

I mean, I can also just do it right away, maybe that's safest for not missing it again.

If we agree that we should, then yes, absolutely :-)! I'm all for that, but I wasn't sure we had consensus about that.

Hm... I'm just looking through the instruction list... and hit ``CALLDATALOAD`` :-)...
That one we can't really disallow I guess... but if we allow it, we might as well keep ``msg.data``...

The problem is still that "externally pure" is different from "internally pure". An external function call I can compile-time evaluate, even if it involves msg.data and ``calldataload`` - but an internal one I cannot...

Well basically `external pure` can have different rules, than `private/public/internal`. We had another issue for tracking the memory-mutability of pure, that should be also revived.

Hm, yeah... I actually thought we couldn't just use different rules due to ``public`` being both internal and external, but it actually makes perfect sense to apply the stricter ``internal`` rules to ``public``...

Anyways, I pushed #12261 for the obvious cases I saw that shouldn't be ``pure``, i.e. ``codecopy`` and ``codesize`` - the rest we can do, once we decide if to split external and internal analysis or what else to do.

What about internal functions that have `calldata` parameters? Can they use inline assembly and thus calldataload to access their parameters?

Yeah - which is a problem. If we allow loading *something* from calldata, we effectively allow loading *anything* from calldata and thus might as well keep ``msg.data`` pure...
Then again, I'm not sure if we should ever even try to actually compile-time-evaluate inline assembly anyways...

So maybe restricting ``pure`` to the notion of "external pure" only is enough (i.e. disallow accessing code, but generally allowing to access calldata however one likes, including via msg.data) - and whether an internal pure function can be compile-time evaluated we can have the compiler decide without a special syntactic marker... but I'm not sure...

I went through the list of documented opcodes while testing #12861. The only opcodes that seem relevant to this issue are:
- `returndatasize()` (disallowed after #12861)
- `returndatacopy()` (disallowed after #12861)
- `calldataload()` (discussed above)
- `calldatasize()` (discussed above)
- `calldatacopy()` (discussed above)
- `codesize()` (disallowed after #12261)
- `codecopy()` (disallowed after #12261)

So I think we're done here. Can we close this issue now?
