This is essentially a common subexpression eliminator, but for non-movable functions. Maybe we can extend this in some more generic way? Of course the idea here is also that we have specialized knowledge about which mstore opcode destroys which keccak call.

Is the only side-effect of keccak that it writes to some scratch space in memory during computation? Do we have other builtins that are almost "side-effect free but not quite" this way? If so, we could maybe generalize it to all of them.

No, keccak only reads from memory. Keccak is side-effect free, but its value depends on the memory contents.

Will rebase this.

So is this just waiting for review?
