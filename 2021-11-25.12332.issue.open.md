# [\#12332 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12332) `open`: Errors reported for modifier overloading should outright say that overloading is not allowed

Error messages reported when you try to overload a modifier say that you cannot use the same name but do not say why. I think they should outright say that the cause of the error is that modifier overloading is not allowed. At least until we actually implement it (#72).

### Example 1: straightforward overloading
```solidity
contract C {
    modifier m(uint x) { _; }
    modifier m() { _; }
}
```
```
Error: Identifier already declared.
 --> test.sol:3:5:
  |
3 |     modifier m() { _; }
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: The previous declaration is here:
 --> test.sol:2:5:
  |
2 |     modifier m(uint x) { _; }
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

### Example 2: overloading by inheriting from two bases
```solidity
contract A {
    modifier m() { _; }
}
contract B {
    modifier m(uint x) { _; }
}
contract C is B, A {}
```
This case is especially misleading because the message suggests that you should override the modifiers in the derived class but they aren't even virtual.

```
Error: Derived contract must override modifier "m". Two or more base classes define modifier with same name.
 --> test.sol:7:1:
  |
7 | contract C is B, A {
  | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
Note: Definition in "A":
 --> test.sol:2:5:
  |
2 |     modifier m() { _; }
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Definition in "B":
 --> test.sol:5:5:
  |
5 |     modifier m(uint x) { _; }
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Is anyone working on this?  I would like to take it on!

It's up for grabs. #12244 is probably simpler though so I'd suggest starting with that one. And going back to this one when you're done.
