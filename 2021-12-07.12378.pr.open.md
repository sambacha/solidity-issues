**Labels**: `external contribution :star:`, `takeover`

Closes #4617.

Implemented changes:
-  If the input does not have any contracts to compile the compiler shows a message "Input did not contain any contracts to compile."

- If the input has contracts to compile but some of them are empty abstract contracts or empty interfaces then the compiler reports that they have not been compiled because of that.

@mejsiej I think we need to change the approach here. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4617#issuecomment-991337025 for details.

I originally took the issue at a face value but while checking your code I noticed that compiler actually never exits without printing something. The issue was outdated and needed some adjustment. We still need it, just not exactly the way the description said.

So currently the PR solves points (1) and (2) listed in my comment. I think we also need (3) and (4). And in case of (2) the compiler already prints sensible output so I think it's better to leave it as it was. We might want to change that behavior a little so I reported #12398 but that issue will require a design decision and might turn out to be a breaking change so I'd keep it out of this PR.

@mejsiej would you like to apply the latest comments?
@cameel or do you want to take over?

Not really, I'm already working on too many things at once. I really need to finish ext tests first. I can review it but with the amount of PRs we're getting I unfortunately didn't manage to get back to this one yet.
