The [`update`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/update) script in [`solc-bin`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/) takes ~10 mins regardless of how many cores you throw at it. That's because while it uses the async/await mechanism in JS but it's still single-threaded. We can reduce that time by parallelizing it and switching to a larger resource class in CI.
