I'm trying to deploy a bridge token(eth-bsc) unfortunately i can't see to figure out how to change its parameters(name&symbol) . Here is the repo: https://github.com/miquelcabot/eth-bsc-bridge
I tried changing the values in TOKENBSC.SOL and TOKENETH.SOL as you can see in the code but no matter whatever the values i change to they dont seem to reflect when deployed..Perhaps i am doing it wrong (as i am naive to solidity) . Hope to get a quick fix for this.

Wrong place for this question. Try solidity gitter or matrix chat.
