# [\#12460 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12460) `open`: Unexpected SLOADs during storing tightly packed struct

## Description

Unexpected SLOADs during storing tightly packed struct. The following code should produce 0 SLOADs and 2 SSTOREs from my point of view. But somehow it executes 1 SLOAD before SSTOREs.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.11
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default (runs=1000000)
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix, Hardhat

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity ^0.8.11;

contract BitPacking {
    struct Data {
        uint48 a;
        uint40 b;
        uint40 c;
        uint128 d;
        uint128 e;
        uint128 f;
    }

    Data public data;

    function func(uint48 _1, uint40 _2, uint40 _3, uint128 _4) external {
        data = Data(_1, _2, _3, _4, _4, _4);
    }
}
```

Solidity is still not very good at optimizing across memory stores (`Data(...)` creates the struct in memory). For now, the more efficient (and maybe also safer) way to do this is to use individual assignments - `data.a = _1; data.b = _2; ...` - since this does not create any copies in memory.

It is weird, though, that slot `0` is even read when doing individual assignments.

@chriseth I tried this code too, even before using structs. I have the same SLOADs and SSTOREs counts but no MLOADs and MSTOREs :)

Looked at the IR. The issue is that the function calls for writing to storage, corresponding to `d`, `e` and `f` are not getting inlined. I'd assume the same issue for the legacy codegen. I think improving the inlining heuristics should fix this.

@hrkrshnn what do you think about adding tests for such cases?

I don't think we have an issue with inlining in the old codegen, because most routines are always inlined at code gen phase already. I would still like the sload of zero to be investigated.

@k06a we already have tests for that and we know that the gas consumption is far from ideal.

I just re-checked the version where we store in struct members directly, i.e.
```
contract BitPacking {
    struct Data {
        uint48 a;
        uint80 b;
        uint128 c;
    }

    Data data;

    function func(uint48 _1, uint80 _2, uint128 _3) external {
        data.a = _1;
        data.b = _2;
        data.c = _3;
    }
}
```

And the code generated via ir does perform multiple stores, but it does not read from the storage slot for the final store (the multiple stores will be fixed by #11352  ).
The code via the old codegen does read from slot 0, but not if the first two members are combined. So I think this might just be a limitation of the old optimizer regarding code complexity.

For reference, IR code:
```
            function fun_func(var, var_1, var_)
            {
                let _1 := and(var, 0xffffffffffff)
                let _2 := sload(0x00)
                sstore(0x00, or(and(_2, not(0xffffffffffff)), _1))
                let toInsert := and(shl(48, var_1), 0xffffffffffffffffffff000000000000)
                let _3 := not(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff)
                sstore(0x00, or(or(and(_2, _3), _1), toInsert))
                sstore(0x00, or(or(toInsert, _1), and(shl(128, var_), _3)))
            }
```

@chriseth what do you think about fixing and adding tests for such cases to avoid future regressions?

That's what we're doing :-). https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11352 will fix the issue and will have appropriate tests, there are just some minor issues yet to be worked out to assure that it's always correct.

@ekpyron thanks, amazing!
