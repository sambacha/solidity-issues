## Abstract
Hi, in the voting example (at line 135 in Remix), picking the winning proposal will not work correctly if two (or more) proposals are tied in the voteCount (see screen shots below). 
Could we at least mention this as a limitation of the current implementation, and, perhaps include the handling of this special case as a "Possible Improvement"

Thank you!
