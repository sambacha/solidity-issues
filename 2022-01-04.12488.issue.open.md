# [\#12488 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12488) `open`: Check Randomness in Phaser Tests
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2022-01-04 16:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12488):

The phaser tests use partly fixed partly time-based seeds, so the choice of tests will affect behaviour.
@cameel wanted to look into them on a per-case basis.

I'd suggest to give all of them a fixed seed by default and add an soltest option with a nightly run that changes that behaviour to random seeds (and maybe higher sample sizes to avoid failures then, since runtime will be less of a concern).
