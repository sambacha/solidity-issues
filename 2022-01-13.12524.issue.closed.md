## Description

The notice tag seen in the images below is used identically in both images, but produces an error in one and not the other. 

Implementation without error:

## Environment

- Compiler version: v0.7.6+commit.7338295f
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Unsure how to retrieve this information.
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): VSCode
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Unsure how to retrieve this information.
- Operating system: MacOS Monterey 12.0.1

## Steps to Reproduce

I'm not quite sure how to reproduce this because this appear to be happening arbitrarily (or at-least I can't seem to identify a reason it should be happening in one file and not the other). I believe the images above are as informative as I can really be as far as reproducing the bug goes.

Thanks for the report!

It's not a bug though. You are using solc 0.7.6 and back then the `@notice` tag was not allowed on non-public state variables. This changed in 0.8.4 and now it's allowed. If you want to use `@notice` like this, please update to a newer compiler version.
