# [\#12527 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12527) `open`: Refine enforce gas cost min value threshold behaviour in ``isoltest``
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2022-01-13 17:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12527):

Currently ``isoltest`` just ignores any existing test expectations, if the actually consumed gas amount is below the ``--enforce-gas-cost-min-value`` value.
For example ``test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts/snark.sol`` at the time of writing says ``// gas irOptimized: 95261`` for ``verifyTx()``. The actual value currently is ``95259``, but the test passes.
The test also passes if I change the expectation to any arbitrary value (both below or above the "enforce-gas-cost-min-value" threshold).

This behaviour is not particularly nice - it will lead to ghost-test-expectations whenever a case falls below the gas threshold.

The only thing determined by ``--enforce-gas-cost-min-value`` should be to determine at which threshold ``isoltest`` should start to actively *add* gas expectations. Existing expectations should always be checked and kept up to date. [alternative: actively *remove* expectations below the threshold; I prefer always checking, though]

IIRC this was always the intended meaning of the option, but as @cameel pointed out, it's name is not particularly well chosen, so in the process it might make sense to rename it.

I'd say that we should remove it at least in the situation where it changes from a value above the threshold to one below. This will happen often with automatically added values that are originally just above the threshold. If they were automatically added then I think they should be automatically removed as well. Only values that were clearly added manually should stay.
