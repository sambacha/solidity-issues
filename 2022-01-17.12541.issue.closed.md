# [\#12541 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12541) `closed`: [Error reporting] Unary compile-time constant expressions not considered compile time constants
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
int8 constant x = 2;
int16 constant y = --x;
```

wrongly reports the following errors:

```
$ solc test.sol
...
Error: Cannot assign to a constant variable.
 --> /tmp/test10.sol:2:22:
  |
2 | int16 constant y = --x;
  |                      ^

Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
 --> /tmp/test10.sol:2:20:
  |
2 | int16 constant y = --x;
  |                    ^^^
```

I feel the error is wrong because `x` is a compile-time constant and hence `--x` should also be one. The implicit upcast should not be an issue since the compiler does not complain for

```
int8 constant x = 2;
int16 constant y = x;
```

Sorry, the error is legitimate because unary operators (++, --) apply to l-values that constants are not.
