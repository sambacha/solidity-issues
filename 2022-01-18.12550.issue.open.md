**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Triggered by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12549.

We don't seem to have this documented very clearly.
To my surprise I didn't find a nice docs link to respond to that issue and @cameel also had a look and concluded in chat:

    The only thing I could find is this: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#data-location-and-assignment-behaviour:
    > Assignments from storage to a local storage variable also only assign a reference.
    I agree that we should have more on that. This is mostly glossed over.

So maybe we should think about where and how to improve the docs on this.

I would like to work on this issue.
