Part of #5956.
~Depends on #12868.~ Merged.

This adds an external test for [Gnosis Protocol v2](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts).
- Only minimal patching required for it to work on 0.8.x. This includes one file in OpenZeppelin.
    - OZ can't easily be upgraded to 4.0 because the project imports some files which were either moved or removed.
- Needed to delete pre-built artifacts that get installed with `@gnosis.pm/safe-contracts` npm package.
- Tests via IR fail due to https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/2115.
- It needs `allowUnlimitedContractSize`. Otherwise one test via IR was failing due to too high deployment cost.

Still TODO:
- [ ] One of the E2E tests (`contractOrdersWithGnosisSafe.test.ts`) depends on being able to import the pre-built artifacts from Gnosis Safe. We always remove all such artifacts in external tests to ensure that we're dealing only with the output of our locally built compiler binary. The problem is that the npm package does not come with Hardhat config so it's not that easy to rebuild in place.
    - The solution might be to just remove the package and instead clone the repo and build it.

@cameel does this need any updates after the dependency PR got merged?

Same as for #12580, this still needs some work. In this case I managed to resolve issues in all presets except for `legacy-no-optimize` last week. The dependency was only to get test results not influenced by breakage in unrelated external tests.
