**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.
~Depends on #12868.~ Merged.

This adds an external test for [Chainlink](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink).
- Unfortunately it requires extensive patching. I originally thought that the repo contains independent contracts for each breaking release and would be easy to integrate. Unfortunately it looks like some contracts were not ported and newer versions depend on older ones.

Status:
- [ ] I think that with that much patching we're better off creating a fork repo in `solidity-external-tests`.
- [ ] I haven't managed to compile it yet so I don't know which presets work.
- [ ] Since it does not compile, tests do not pass either.

Not sure if I'll continue with this one or just close it. Chainlink is very widely used so it would be great to have it but it does require a lot of patching. On the other hand, I think only the 0.8.x part is actively developed so our patches should keep working once we have them.

@cameel does this need any updates after the dependency PR got merged?

No, this PR still needs some work. Specifically, patching for tests to pass on 0.8.x. I was working on it last week but was interrupted by the ext test breakage - the dependency was only to get test results not influenced by that breakage.
