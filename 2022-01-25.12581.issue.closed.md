# [\#12581 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12581) `closed`: Extend the language to have an EVENT.selector and ERROR.selector
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

## Abstract

Add `ev.selector` and `err.selector` fields that would work similarly to `fun.selector`, extracting event signature (topic 0) from its definition

```
interface MyInterface {
    event someEvent();
    error someError();
    function someFunction() external;
}

contract Test {
    function nameIsIrrelevant() public {
        bytes4  x = MyInterface.someFunction.selector; // This works
        bytes32 y = MyInterface.someEvent.selector; // This doesn't, that is what I'd like to add
        bytes32 z = MyInterface.someError.selector; // This doesn't, that is what I'd like to add
    }
}
```

## Motivation

Some cross chain mechanism, such as polygon's [FxBaseRootTunnel](https://github.com/fx-portal/contracts/blob/main/contracts/tunnel/FxBaseRootTunnel.sol), perform event inclusion check that require the event signature. This is likely to become a more frequent need with inclusion proofs being an important part of rollups.

## Specification

Add a bytes32 field named `.selector`, `.topic0` or `.signature` to events (and a similar one to errors), that the compiler would replace with the event's signature (keccak256 of the event description)

## Backwards Compatibility

I can't imagine this would cause any backward compatibility issue

This data is not currently inspectable on-chain.  Would this mean it would be used for processing some kind of proofs?

Isn't using a constant-keccak256 expression a good enough solution for now?

Yes, it would be used to process some kind of proof.

constant-keccak256 expression is good enough, just like `bytes4(keccak256("transfer(address,uint256")` used to be enough: it works, but it is error prone.

`Event.selector` as well as `CustomError.selector` could both make sense. If they're necessary, it's better for the compiler to generate them.

This would likely also be useful for Optimism's bridges

This sounds good, but we have to find a better name. For anonymous events, `topic0` is something else.

What about `selector` just like for functions?

Sorry, somehow I missed your coment. `selector` of course makes perfect sense.

I think for error the term `selector` works, but for events it should have been `topic`.

I was wondering as well, but I think users would find it confusing to have yet another name for something.
