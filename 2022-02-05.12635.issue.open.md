# [\#12635 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12635) `open`: Tuple elements index access
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

## Abstract

Tuples elements can be accessed with indexes. Let's have it!

## Motivation

Other programming languages have this feature, it's quite useful. I believe code could be more expressive with this feature.

## Specification

Tuple could be called anonymous struct, with both name and field names anonymous. We could use indexes to have access to individual fields:

```solidity
function foo() public view returns(uint256 value, bytes memory data) { ... }

foo().0
foo().1
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Not sure there is any way to make this backward compatible.

The main problem I see is that tuples are not "proper" types in solidity.

But it's just the fact that we have no tuple-type variables, right? I don't think this particular feature would force us in any way to introduce them.

Though I'm not sure I like the proposed syntax. The index looks like a field name, which it is not. Why not array brackets instead?

The point is that we do not want to have arbitrary access to tuple elements - the element always has to be a compile-time constant, otherwise code generation gets very complicated.

Yeah, conceptually, as @k06a says, tuples should work like anonymous structs with only compile-time fixed members for accessing tuple elements.
Dynamically accessing tuple elements is not only complicated in code generation, but more importantly, it's impossible to type-check, so that's a no-go, but static access is fine.

But yeah, I'd actually even be down for promoting tuples to proper, even namable types in general - I've always wanted that :-). But even without that, compile-time fixed index access to them would definitely be nice - just not sure about the syntax.

@cameel array brackets makes me think elements are of the same type, which is not true.

Also I remember someone asked for ability to use tuples as arguments in function calls:
```solidity
token.transfer(getReceiverAndAmount());
```

In general I think tuples should be proper types.
I used to dislike this syntax too, but nowadays I actually like it. It's succinct, clear, and already used by other languages.

I think it depends on what each of us is used to. To me the `.0` syntax feels a bit like I'm abusing some internal mechanism that exposes element indexes as properties on an object. It just looks weird. On the other hand, having used Python a lot, using brackets to index tuples feels completely natural and intuitive.

In any case, I agree that it would be nice to have tuples as proper types or at least some way to access elements, whatever syntax we might eventually settle on.
