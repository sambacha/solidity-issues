# [\#12645 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12645) `closed`: SMTChecker example doesn't output the correct result as stated in the documentation

## Page

<!--Please link directly to the page which you think has a problem.-->

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/smtchecker.html

## Abstract

<!--Please describe in detail what is wrong.-->

For the example Monotonic contract of version 0.8.10, "Since f is indeed monotonically increasing, the SMTChecker proves that our property is correct." according to the documentation.
However, I checked it by my own compiled Solidity, the results are as follows,

Warning: CHC: Overflow (resulting value larger than 2**256 - 1) might happen here.
  --> overflow.sol:28:16:
   |
28 |         return _x * 42;
   |                ^^^^^^^

Warning: CHC: Assertion violation might happen here.
  --> overflow.sol:33:9:
   |
33 |         assert(f(_b) > f(_a));
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

My command is:
solc_0.8.10 overflow.sol --model-checker-contracts "overflow.sol:Monotonic" --model-checker-engine chc --model-checker-invariants all --model-checker-solvers z3 --model-checker-show-unproved --model-checker-targets all --model-checker-timeout 10

Maybe something wrong with my command?
Btw, the flag of model-checker-contracts seems not work for me, it always checks all the contracts in the file, anything wrong?
Thanks.

Hi @gaobo89 !

> Maybe something wrong with my command?

Please note that the timeout is given in milliseconds, and the solver can't find the answer within 10ms. Maybe try giving it a bit more time :) locally for me 100ms is enough, but usually I tend to give it 1s, 10s, or more depending on the problem.

Which solc version? There was a recent bug that was causing that, which was fixed 2 or 3 versions ago. If you're using the latest version and still seeing that behavior please open an issue and we can check there.

Dear Leo,

Thanks for your response, it solves my problem, the timeout really matters!
