Requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12716#issuecomment-1054141878.
Related to #12350.

> I would actually be happier if we could find a way to somehow set an "illegal" locale so that we get an error whenever we perform a locale-dependent operation (and of course remove all locale-dependent operations).

The docs for [`std::setlocale()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/setlocale) have a nice list of things that are affected by the global variable:
- `std::fprintf()`
- `std::fscanf()`
- `std::isalnum()`
- `std::isalpha()`
- `std::isblank()`
- `std::iscntrl()`
- `std::isdigit()`
- `std::isgraph()`
- `std::islower()`
- `std::isprint()`
- `std::ispunct()`
- `std::isspace()`
- `std::isupper()`
- `std::iswalnum()`
- `std::iswalpha()`
- `std::iswblank()`
- `std::iswcntrl()`
- `std::iswctype()`
- `std::iswdigit()`
- `std::iswgraph()`

@cameel I tried to run compilation with many different locales. The only failing scenario was the one with Turkey. I think, the locale change is not enough to identify all affected code pieces. We need also use non-trivial input file that involves the entire codebase. Another option could be to run all tests we have against several locales. Do you think it might work?

Have you tried to force `setlocale()` to use something that is not a real locale? @chriseth's idea was to do that so basically any use of these functions fails in some obvious way.

This way we'd find them all and replace them with locale-neutral alternatives. For example instead [`int toupper(int)`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/toupper) from `<ctype>` we'd use [`charT toupper(charT, const locale&)`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/toupper) from `<locale>` passing it the C locale explicitly.

Not sure it's worth it. `soltest` runs in CI are already pretty heavy and we have quite a few of them. Locale is a corner case that I'd expect to work correctly once we get it right once so my minimal test should be enough to detect it. I even have doubts it my test isn't an overkill - it's an extra standalone job that will now run on every PR. Ideally I'd have it a a part of the CLI runs but I didn't want to add a dependency on the locale package to the CLI test script.

@cameel yes, I did and end up with "C" locale.
I am not surprised, since "setlocale" documentation says:

> If the function failed to set a new locale, this is not modified and a null pointer is returned.

I also tried to use not-existing environment locale or break locale environment configuration with: 

> export LC_ALL="invalid"
> dpkg-reconfigure locales

which leads to:

> locale -a
> locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
> locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
> locale: Cannot set LC_COLLATE to default locale: No such file or directory
> C
> C.UTF-8
> POSIX

In all the cases "C" was a locale in charge while solc execution.
