Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12738
It would have been quicker to determine the cause of that, if we had a simple tool to translate binary bytecode to an opcode list.
And we do have ``evmasm::disassemble`` anyways for the compiler's ``--opcodes`` output.

Specification:
Add a simple tool in ``tools/`` that reads a hex string from stdin and writes the result of ``evmasm::disassemble(util::fromHex(stdinContent), "\n")`` to stdout.

The result will not really be a good disassembler, since it won't resolve tags or anything fancy, but it'd still help in diffing binary bytecode.

Just want to mention that the `evm` executable from geth (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#executables) is also useful for this. `evm disasm file.txt`

Yeah, there are a lot of other ways to do this - still, since we have the function anyways, there's little harm in making it a little tool in our repo as well...
