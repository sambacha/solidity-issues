## Abstract

The value returned by address.balance is slightly different for msg.sender. In that case it is reduced by the transaction's gas limit multiplied by the tx.gasprice.

Code that attempts to compare balances and make decisions should be aware of this.

I have proposed a tweak to the documentation for address.balance. Please review and edit as appropriate.
