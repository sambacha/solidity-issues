**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

## Description

Importing overloaded methods in Solidity 0.8.12 gives an error instead of loading the methods, even if the methods are not called.


Other info that might be relevant:
- Checking the Solidity change list I found something that *might* be relevant
> Inheritance: Consider functions in all ancestors during override analysis.

- @chriseth once said that Solidity performs conflict resolution when the method is called. However, this doesn't seem to be the case anymore.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.12
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): compiler default (but happens with all versions)
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix, but happens everywhere
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: any
- Operating system: any

## Steps to Reproduce

Consider these 2 files created in Remix IDE

- `Math.sol` - defines 2 methods, same name, different arguments

```solidity
function sub(uint256 x, uint256 y) pure {}
function sub(uint256 x, int256 y) pure {}
```

- `ImportMath.sol` - just tries to import the `sub` method 

```solidity
import {sub} from "./Math.sol";
```

Output error on compilation:

```
TypeError: No matching declaration found after variable lookup.
 --> ImportMath.sol:1:9:
  |
1 | import {sub} from "./Math.sol";
  |         ^^^
```

That means I don't know how to import those methods.

So how do we fix it? Just not perform overload resolution if the reference is inside an import statement?

We didn't do it before 0.8.12, so we should just keep not doing it, yes.
