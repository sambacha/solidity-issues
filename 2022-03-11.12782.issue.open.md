# [\#12782 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12782) `open`: allow specifying a function should be inlined in the signature
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

many internal functions are so small that they should be inlined to avoid a jump

perhaps the solidity optimizer should handle this with a large number of runs, but some functions are expected to be run much more than others.

it would be nice to be able to control whether a function is inlined where it's called at the callsite or in the function signature

I cannot find an issue covering this but I think it was discussed before. I only see #10938, which is about improving the inlining in the optimizer.

Overall, I remember that out position was that we want to make inlining heuristics better, not drop the responsibility on the users. In most cases the compiler is in a better position to make that decision. There are of course where you're hand-optimizing a specific piece of code and you'd make a better decision, but we prefer to focus on getting the optimizer better rather than on adding syntax for fine-tuning it, which complicates the language.

Having said that, I agree that there's a lot to improve here. The biggest reason why it isn't more aggressive right now are the "Stack too deep" errors. Inlining in most cases increases stack pressure so you're more likely to run into them. Work on that has been going for quite a while and we're actually reaching the point where we're considering relaxing the conditions for inlining, at least for the new code generator. See #12731.

Another obstacle was that it was hard to evaluate how much the change will affect real projects. That's also something we have taken care of - we now have a more extensive set of projects to benchmark against, including Uniswap - so you can expect more progress on that front.
