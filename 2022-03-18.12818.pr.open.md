~Depends on #12804.~ Merged.

The script makes several CirecleCI and Github API requests to get the JSON with benchmark results for a specific PR or branch. I think it will be very handy for manual use, though my primary goal here is to use it in `c_ext_benchmarks` job to get benchmarks from the base PR and provide the diff. The PR extends that job to generate such diffs and attach them as artifacts.

After the experiences with #12181 and https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/35 I decided to use Python to make this more maintainable. This way I'll be able to cover it with tests, and, compared to my earlier Bash scripts, it was easy to make a module with helpers that we'll be able to reuse in other situations that require API access. While it isn't that short as a whole, it's more concise compared to the previous Bash scripts - the main logic specific to this task is concentrated in one function and the rest are reusable helpers and command-line argument definitions (which is more like docs than real code).

I'm on purpose not trying to do too much error handling to keep things simple. I.e. it either works or you get an exception. Only the cases that would not just crash on unexpected response (like finding no matching results) are explicitly checked.

~This is still work in progress. I still need to~ Everything is done:
- [x] Add some unit tests.
- [x] Handle the case where the job has not finished yet.
- [x] Test some corner cases to make sure things fail properly on errors.
- [x] Getting artifacts for the specific revision of base branch that the requested PR/branch is based on. This would be helpful in cases where base branch has moved on since the PR/branch was created and has extra commits that affect benchmark results.

### Usage of the script
To get benchmarks from your branch and from develop, you just run this:
```bash
scripts/externalTests/download_benchmarks.py --branch develop
scripts/externalTests/download_benchmarks.py
```
This stores `summarized-benchmarks-<branch>-<commit hash>.json` and `all-benchmarks-<branch>-<commit hash>.json` in the current directory. Now you can run the script from #12804 on the files.

If you want to compare someone else's PR you probably have the PR number handy - you can pass that to the script using the `--pr` option instead of the branch.

You can also use `--base-of-pr` option to get artifacts from the branch your PR is based on (instead of `develop`). By default the script finds a CI run matching not only the base branch name but also the exact commit. This guarantees that even if the base branch has moved on  and has extra commits, your comparison will not be influenced by these commits.

Sometimes you might still want to get the benchmark from the latest state of the base branch, e.g. if there was no successful run on the commit you're based on and you know that any extra commits are not going to distort results all that much - in that case you can use `--any-commit` flag to bypass the commit check.

This is now done and ready for review.

Note, about the `c_ext_benchmarks` failure:
```
Looking for pipelines that ran on branch benchmark-differ, commit fd0ec2e30a8d9c60bfbb15a984cf90bb0f571908.
[ERROR] Job c_ext_benchmarks has failed or is still running. Current status: blocked.
```

This is a limitation of the script with regard to PRs that are based one on the other. The job tries to access artifacts from the same job on the base PR. If both were pushed at the same time, it's likely that that base job has not finished yet. In that case if just needs to be reran after the base job finishes.

> This is a lot of infrastructure for just downloading some files :-). But probably not much one can do to avoid that...

Unfortunately, dealing with APIs reliably is just verbose. This is not the first time I need to access their APIs and I always end up with a really ugly Bash script. We really needed some wrappers for that that we can later reuse as needed.

CircleCI actually has its own CLI utility called `circleci` and I was initially hoping I'd get away just using that instead of writing it in Python. But it does not really have the same use case. It does not have commands for fetching info from the API, only for controlling the pipelines from CLI.

Also, to be fair, it adds more value than just "downloading some files". It automates finding the exact runs that you need which is more tedious than it seems at first. E.g. if your branch is based on `develop` and something got merged in the meantime, you have to dig into history find the old commit ID, then locate the right run via this horrible list of pipelines in CircleCI's UI with infinite scroll. It's painful to use, especially If what you're looking for is not immediately on the first page. With the script you just give it a PR number and it either gives you the right benchmark or fails. Or you go to the artifacts in your PR and find the diff attached there. You don't have to think about it, which is how it should work.
