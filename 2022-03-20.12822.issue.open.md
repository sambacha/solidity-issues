## Usage

Sometimes it is required to a make a contract which is intended to be inherited. And the designer wants to ensure that the inherited will not change a specific storage variable. But at the same time this storage variable may be readable.

From a practical point of view, setters almost always have some access controls on them. Because of that, I don't see a need for compiler generated setters.

This issue is not about compiler generated setters.

This issue is about disallowing a subclass from accessing the setter of the parent.

@fulldecent The syntax is not quite clear to me:

```solidity
abstract contract ThreeChiefOfficers {
    /// @notice Get the chief executive officer
    /// @dev The account that can only reassign officer accounts
    address public(get) private(set) executiveOfficer;
    // ...
}
```

Would `private(set)` create a compiler generated setter? If not, how does the compiler connect the declaration to the actual setter?

There is no generated setter function. 

The expression is meant to indicate that an inheriting contract will NOT be allowed to use that state variable as an l-value.
