# [\#12825 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12825) `open`: LSP throwing an error on each and every character I type in the editor
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `language server`

## Description

The LSP throws an error whenever I'm editing a .sol file. The error gets triggered every time I type a character. Restarting the LSP or reinstalling it doesn't fix the problem.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.13
- Editor: NeoVim 0.7.0
- LSP client: NeoVim built-in
- Operating system: Arch Linux 

## Steps to Reproduce

Open any .sol file and start typing.

Error message:
```
LSP[solc]: Error INVALID_SERVER_MESSAGE: {
  error = {
    code = -32603,
    message = "Unhandled exception: /solidity/libsolidity/lsp/HandlerBase.cpp(48): Throw in function Json::Value solidity::lsp::HandlerBase::toJson(const solidity::langutil::SourceLocatio
n&) const\nDynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\nstd::exception::what: Solidity assertion failed\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Solidity
 assertion failed\n"
  },
  jsonrpc = "2.0"
```

Hey @Gilgames000. Thanks for your report. I am using coc.nvim along with NeoVIM / VIM. Can you maybe tell me your vim-native LSP configuration such that I can reproduce your local environment?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22778436?u=d1e99f029a399fdb9a2e183d90c187defcff942a&v=4" width="50">[Gilgames000](https://github.com/Gilgames000) commented at [2022-03-21 04:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12825#issuecomment-1074471822):

Sure @christianparpart! I use the built-in LSP client, the official [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) configuration for it, [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) and an auto-completion engine that uses LSPs as completion sources, and [nvim-lsp-installer](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) to easily install and manage LSP servers.

You can install all of this using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```
Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
Plug 'williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer'
Plug 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'
Plug 'hrsh7th/cmp-nvim-lsp'
```

and then use `:LspInstall solc` to install solc. That's it! I didn't customize the LSP config. The default config can be found [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/solc.lua). It sets the nearest ancestor with a .git folder as the root directory, and triggers the server on .sol files. The [LSP install script](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer/blob/main/lua/nvim-lsp-installer/servers/solc/init.lua) gets the server from the GitHub releases page.

The only problem is that I get the error quite randomly, meaning that it doesn't fire right away sometimes. Though it always shows up quite consistently after I write some code. I still couldn't figure out what code exactly triggers it since it shows up quite often anyway...

I tried enabling `solc` again today to see if I could find some more clues about the issue. After writing a few lines of code I got this:
```
LSP[solc]: Error INVALID_SERVER_MESSAGE: {
  error = {
    code = -32603,
    message = "Unhandled exception: /solidity/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp(353): Throw in function bool solidity::frontend::CompilerStack::parse()\nDynamic exception type: boos
t::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>\nstd::exception::what: Parser returned null but did not report error.\n[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Parser returned null but d
id not report error.\n"
  },
  jsonrpc = "2.0"
}
```

Looks like a new message :monocle_face:

Yes, thanks @Gilgames000. Seems like neovim is doing something fishy here. It looks like it's not senting the initialization as its first step. I'll keep you posted. :)

I see, thanks! Should I open an issue on neovim repo? Or the lsp repo? Since you seemed to imply that the problem is on their end. Correct me if I'm wrong!

Hey @christianparpart this morning I decided to go back to coc.nvim for the time being just for Solidity since you said it works fine for you so I set it up using the config I found in your dotfiles. But now I'm facing the same problem and error message on coc.nvim too. Here's the log:

```
## versions

vim version: NVIM v0.7.0-dev+1299-g773516365
node version: v16.14.2
coc.nvim version: 0.0.80-1fffa716 2022-04-04 12:52:23 +0800
coc.nvim directory: /home/gilgames/.config/nvim/plugged/coc.nvim
term: tmux
platform: linux

## Log of coc.nvim

    },
    "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```
and then the log goes on and on with the same error message being spammed for each keystroke I press when I'm editing a Solidity file.

I'm having the exact same error but with coq_nvim. Used the same method as @Gilgames000 to install solc.

Facing the same error on MacOS, same installation method. The language server works great for a few minutes, then starts throwing this error on every keystroke - haven't been able to find out what triggers it yet.

I noticed you mentioned that nvim is doing something weird with the initialization, so I think this may be related: Running `:LspRestart` always fails, but it gives a different error.

```
  error = {
    code = -32002,
    message = "Server is not properly initialized."
  }
```

Having the same issues as well. Running `:LspRestart` also yields 

```
LSP[solc]: Error INVALID_SERVER_MESSAGE: {
  error = {
    code = -32002,
    message = "Server is not properly initialized."
  },
  jsonrpc = "2.0"
```

Read my [log files](https://pastebin.com/BZZdJZws) and this is the first error that showed up for me 

```

}
```
