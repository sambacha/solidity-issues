throws the said error although the length literal is an integer literal and a constant expression.

I think the issue is that the constant is too large - we should improve the error message.

```
contract C {
  function ()[uint8(5)] x;
}
```

also errors similarly. But here there is something else wrong.

On debugging, it looks like the constant evaluator does not evaluate explicitly typed constant literals like `uint8(1)`.

Minor update: This error is also encountered when statically defined array size is a compile-time constant but is not in a form that will be evaluated as such because it is not of a `RationalNumberType` e.g., `bool[uint8(1)] x;`

I believe this should be dealt with in `ConstantEvaluator.cpp`. Indeed it's not visiting such AST variant at the moment. We can raise another issue if needed, and I can send a PR for that.

The constant is definitely too large. We don't really support exponentiation in arbitrary precision with such large numbers. If you remove explicit conversions, you get this error message:
```
Error: Operator ** not compatible with types int_const 7720...(69 digits omitted)...2195 and int_const 1020...(38 digits omitted)...1094
```
And you don't even need numbers that large to get this error. You'd get it even with something like `10 ** 5000`.

> Minor update: This error is also encountered when statically defined array size is a compile-time constant but is not in a form that will be evaluated as such because it is not of a `RationalNumberType` e.g., `bool[uint8(1)] x;`

I think it's by design. It seems to be the same kind of issue as #12677. I.e. expressions stop being treated as compile-time constants once you convert to a limited-precision type. It's not ideal but at least does not look like a bug to me.

I think we should just properly document what is considered a "constant expression" or a "compile-time constant" and maybe also adjust the error message to be clearer about that.

I believe this can be closed by #12885

Two things we might still want to do as a part of this:
- Explicitly say in the docs that adding a type conversion currently makes a literal non-usable as a compile-time constant?
- Adjust the message you get when the length is a literal but with an explicit conversion?
    ```solidity
    uint[uint(1)] valid_size_invalid_expr1;
    // TypeError 5462: (22-29): Invalid array length, expected integer literal or constant expression.
    ```
    `uint(1)` can reasonably be interpreted as a constant expression and the message does not clear that up.

What do you think?

I think that'll be a a good temporary workaround before we fully address the second thing.

I do think we should make the constant evaluator more aggressive by stripping away type conversion for applicable constants. With the limited context I have, that seems to address the issue at its root. Also similar things are suggested [in another thread](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12886#issuecomment-1086922539).

I'd gladly try sending a PR for this, if we think it's worth attempting and viable.

We can't just strip the conversion. It may affect the value (e.g. casting `uint` to `uint16` or negative `int` to `uint`). What we could do would be to extend the constant expression evaluation to cover these but I'm not sure if it'll be that simple. I think this is in scope for #3157, though it's not explicitly listed there so I added a comment.

I think issue I think we should just update docs/messages and close it, leaving evaluation for #3157.

You are right, I'll look into #3157.

Agree!

It's a rather big task. Compile-time evaluation is something we've been discussing for a while now. It's on our roadmap but we're not even decided on all details yet.

Are you interested in getting that specific feature implemented in the compiler or are you just looking for a good task to contribute in general? If it's the latter, I can find you a better defined task. If the former, you should really come to one of our [team calls](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#team-calls) and join the design discussion on that topic (note that the next few calls might be a bit sparsely attended due to [Devconnect](https://devconnect.org) though).

Thanks for the info! I'd say for now I'm just looking for a small tasks to contribute in general. If you can give me some pointers, I'll try to pick them up when possible:).
