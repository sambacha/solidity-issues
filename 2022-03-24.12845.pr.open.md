(1) The word "arbitrary" is not strictly correct as I understand it, although I would concede that in this context, many people would understand it to mean "any." I believe, however, that strictly speaking, Solidity treats these expressions as if they had effectively unlimited precision, or equivalently, at minimum the precision of the target conversion.

A highly technical reader might be left wondering if Solidity literally is selecting an arbitrary precision vs the necessary precision such that the precision seems unlimited.

(Dictionary definition of "arbitrary": Determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle)

(2) The note about number literal types seems to be unnecessarily typing implementation details of the compiler relative to number literal types, but I think the important point the documentation is trying to convey simply has to do with the equivalence of literal expressions to the type of the result -- I am therefore proposing an alternative wording.

(3) I believe my proposed wording is a bit less confusing for the final note. I am not sure how to use :ref: correctly, so please fix that if incorrect. I also noticed a whhile typo in my pull request, which should be fixed if accepted.

Note that [Arbitrary Precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) is an idiomatic, technical term in this context that means precisely what we are talking about here.

Fair enough :)

Squashed and rebased on `develop`.
