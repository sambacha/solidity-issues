I am pretty sure the original text referencing a conversion to integer is wrong, but I am only mostly sure my proposed edits are strictly correct.

Thank you for all the good suggestions! I think your PRs have value, but maybe you could slim them down a bit, so we can merge those parts that do not require any discussion first?

I'm a noob at making doc suggestion PRs. Happy to conform to whatever process is best for your workflow. Just let me know. Can you clarify for example what you mean by "slim them down"?  Do you mean you'd like me to submit each individual paragraph being changed as an individual PR? 

Or do you just literally mean "make your changes shorter?"  <--- that is exactly counter to adding words that yes, lengthen the docs, but hopefully at the same time reduce ambiguity. It has been my experience that both some amount of repetition and some amount of stating things 2-3 different ways, helps humans absorb new information.

I meant that some of your changes are fine as they are and some others are being discussed. Since discussion on wording is usually lengthy on pull requests, you could extract the parts that do not need any discussion and we can merge them right away.

Understood. By the way, is there a forum where we could chat about proposed changes *before* I even write one? For example, I'm currently reading some of the docs on the `address` type members where I could add something to the docs, but I'm not sure it's the right place etc and would like to ask first...

Sure! Just come to our chat room as explained in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#workflow-for-pull-requests
