# [\#12863 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12863) `open`: Nested arrays inside structs are not included in generated ABI

## Description

Nested arrays inside structs are not included in the generated ABI. Original issue reported in the Hardhat repo at https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2433

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.0
- Framework/IDE: Hardhat 2.8.4

## Steps to Reproduce

After compiling the following contract, I don't see the integer array `ids` as part of the generated ABI in `artifacts/contracts/Example.sol/Example.json`, neither as part of the mapping `mappedData` nor in the top-level struct field `data`.
```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    struct Data {
        uint256[] ids;
        uint256 createdAt;
        address user;
    }
    mapping (uint256 => Data) public mappedData;
    Data public data;
}
```
FWIW I have also tried with a different type of nested array ( `address[]`) and it also has the same issue so it doesn't look type-specific.

The reason I think this is worth opening an issue is that it can be confusing for users. Maybe a warning can be printed when a struct element isn't included in the abi.

@alcuadrado why wouldn't this get fixed at its source in the first place though? The generated ABI should include all public storage fields.

Hey @kargakis,

You are confusing what an ABI is. It's just a description of the binary encoding of inputs and outputs and other things that a smart contract understands/generate. Adding fields to the ABI will not make the contract start returning them, but it will make things worse instead.
