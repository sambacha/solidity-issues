# [\#12879 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12879) `open`: Clarify leading relative path segments in import paths
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`

Note: The "Preview" tab on github did *NOT* show the .. code:: block around line ~290 even before my changes. Not sure what's up with that. The rst seems correct, and it displays properly  at ``https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html#import-callback``

Also, I inferred the rule for ``.`` in the leading part of the import path based on the description that the import path itself is first normalized. My edit may therefore be incorrect if ``..`` segments in the leading part of the import path behave the same way as they do in the instant rule (e.g. if ``././../foo.bar`` in the import path means ``./foo.bar``). Doubtful.

Also note, the "normalization" of the import path is not exactly the normalization referred to in the CLI path normalization, since it remains relative. Probably ok not to mention explicitly.
