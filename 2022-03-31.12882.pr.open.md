# [\#12882 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12882) `open`: Reword the section about cleaning up variables `variable_cleanup.rst`
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`

The original section title is misleading, because it sounds like it would be a discussion of memory allocation cleanup -- and that's not really a thing in Solidity or the EVM. The section actually deals with whether padding bits are zeroed. There's also some really low level discussion of JUMPI with quite a head-scratcher of an example!

Rebased on `develop`.

Please avoid changing the location of newlines. It makes this much harder to review.

Hey, I don't want to burden you with doc review so I've simply changed the wording of this PR back to "cleaned" (from cleared/zeroed) given @[hrkrshnn](https://github.com/hrkrshnn)'s comments. I've also avoided attempting to reword the table that follows which talks about "Invalid Values"

I will note however that it seems like that content is dated and misplaced? It seems like the "Invalid Values Mean" column is referring to how the compiler deals not so much with cleaning, but with stored values or operations that overflow the underlying type???  Thus, where the table says "in the future exceptions will be thrown" is now outdated right?
