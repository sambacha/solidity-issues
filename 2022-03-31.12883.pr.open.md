fixes #11879 

This is an early version of the changes needed to support literals conversion to dynamic arrays. Definitely it is not ready to review yet.

Things we should not forget to test:
 - assigning to storage
 - `x = [x[1], x[0]]`, where `x` is a multi-dimensional storage array

Interestingly, at a quick glance, the optimizer seems to be handling this rather well even for larger-than-16-elements-arrays (without having to use stack-to-memory).

Random idea for a syntax test on this:
```
function f(uint256[] memory x) {}
function f(uint256[3] memory x) {}
function g() {
  f([1]); // should work
  f([1,2,3]); // should fail (no unique function)
  f([1,2,3,4]); // should work
}
```
This should work already, but good to have a test for it.

Please note that I think it makes sense to re-unify this with tuple type again. For now, it helps to find places where it is used as an inline array, but in the end, they types are very similar, especially when we keep just putting things on the stack.
