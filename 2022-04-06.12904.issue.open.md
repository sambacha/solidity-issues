# [\#12904 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12904) `open`: Improve building Solidity on Windows
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

* While I personally think `vcpkg` should really be at least supported, I also struggled in getting `soltest.exe` linked against vcpkg's provided boost as it kept trying to link using the boost DLLs rather than static libraries.
* I was running `install_deps.ps1` from project root and have received error messages that come from the fact that  I wasn't executing the script one level deeper (d.g. ./build/ directory).
* Additional cmake flags are required, even when used in conjunction with the install-deps.ps1 provided dependencies. That should not be the case. Custom flags need to be passed to cmake are: `-DBoost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME=ON -DBoost_DIR=${projectDir}\\deps\\boost\\lib\\cmake\\Boost-1.77.0 -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded`
* The install-deps script could probably be made a little more fool-proof / robust, i.e. it should allow to be invoked more than once and not bail out with weird error messages.

Furthermore:
- we should more gracefully handle privilege errors in the symlink tests.
- we may consider making the non-release windows build a debug build (that would have caught https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12902)
- we need to fix VS2022 builds (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12802 contains a CI setup for that, but is still lacking the actual range-v3-related fix)
- Also (although this may not strictly related to windows builds), ideally, linking soltest to dynamic boost should also be possible without issues.

I forgot what I did to work around the following error when executing `./scripts/install_deps.ps1`:

```
...
Building Boost.Build engine
LOCALAPPDATA=C:\Users\chris\AppData\Local
Found with vswhere C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community
###
### "Unknown toolset: vcunk"
...
```

which I am facing again, but probably also worth fixing for the common user.
