# [\#12912 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12912) `closed`: Suggest trying to compile via IR in the stack-too-deep error message in legacy compilation.

Since it seems like via IR compilation works in a lot of such cases these days, this might help against stack-too-deep frustration and help in promoting via-IR codegen.

Actually, maybe better to explicitly suggest *optimized IR codegen*, since unoptimized via IR code is *more* likely to have issues than legacy code I'm afraid...

Agree. We should do this right away.
