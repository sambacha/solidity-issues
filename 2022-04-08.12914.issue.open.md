# [\#12914 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12914) `open`: Try again to fuzz calldata validation when decoding invalid abi encodings.
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Since https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12907 slipped through our fingers in our last fuzzing efforts, maybe we should think about fuzzing validation of invalid encodings again. (I think previously we were mainly focusing on sound decoded values of valid encodings, resp. fuzzing encoding-decoding-encoding etc.)

There are multiple ways to trigger full calldata validation.
```
  SomeType s;
  function f(SomeType calldata x) {
    abi.encode(x); // validation during re-encoding
    SomeType memory y = x; /// validation during copies to memory
    s = x; /// validation during copies to storage
  }
```
We need to double-check that the "copy-to-memory" case includes member- and index-access cases - if not, we'd have to also generate function bodies that access each nested value of the argument.

More than that, generating random encodings may too rarely merely fail in nested sub-types, so we may need to start from full valid encodings and mutate them only slightly.

Another issue is that the Isabelle-based reference implementation of an decoder may be too slow to do this on a large scale, but we can try.

While all of this is significant effort, unfortunately it's also quite hard to test the various scenarios in up to three-fold nested types manually...
