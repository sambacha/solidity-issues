Hello fam, this is my first post on Github so, hi !

I am currently learning to dev in Solidity so I am following the "online course" freecode camp : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ&t=18664s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org]
I am currently at 5:10:25 and i have an issue with the compiler, when i try to compile, I have the following error : 



```
> CompilerError: solc returned the following errors:
> 
> contracts/FundMe.sol:5:1: ParserError: Source "C:/Users/Loïc PORCO/.brownie/packages/smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@1.1.1/contracts/src/v0.6/vendor/SafeMathChainlink.sol" not found: File outside of allowed directories.
> import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/vendor/SafeMathChainlink.sol";
> ^------------------------------------------------------------------^

> contracts/FundMe.sol:6:1: ParserError: Source "C:/Users/Loïc PORCO/.brownie/packages/smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@1.1.1/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol" not found: File outside of allowed directories.
> import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";
> ^--------------------------------------------------------------------------^
```

After searching on internet, I think I understood that the place where my  2 files are is not in an allowed path so i have to manually allow this path w the command --allow-paths, but i didnt understand how it works, so iam asking for your help.

In order to be more specific ill post images of my VSCODE 
my .yaml :

my .sol :

Iam on windows.
Thank you for your time !
