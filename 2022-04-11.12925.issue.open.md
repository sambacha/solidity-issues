# [\#12925 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12925) `open`: CircleCI dependency caching broken on macOS
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `testing :hammer:`

Restoring cache in macOS jobs takes ~17 minutes. See for example [recent `b_osx` run on `develop`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23649/workflows/01a8fe85-debd-4892-874c-2745e02c10cc/jobs/1038415). There are lots of errors about symlinks being skipped, which might have something to do with it:
```
...
Skipping writing "usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb: permission denied
Skipping writing "usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb: permission denied
Skipping writing "usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler
...
```

For now we have disabled the cache because just installing the dependencies is quicker than that (4 min). Still, the cache used to save us some time so we need to investigate and fix the problem. Might be a good idea to report it to CircleCI.
