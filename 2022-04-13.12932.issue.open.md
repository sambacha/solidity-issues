## Description

When compiling with the specific file in the standard-json-input's `outputSelection` field, the compiler throws the error `Definition of base has to precede definition of derived contract` but when the files in the `outputSelection` is given as `"*"` the compiler compiles successfully. 

Noticed this as the [Sourcify](https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify) recompiler targets the specific file and output in the generated json-input and couldn't compile but the user was able to compile and deploy the contract via Hardhat (which has `"*"` in `outputSelection`.) 

I'd say the error is correct since according to the order of importing the definition of the base contract is below the inheriting contract, as suggested by the error. Nevertheless a change in the `outputSelection` should not be effecting how the compiler behaves.

this `outputSelection` throws:
```json
  "settings": {
    "evmVersion": "london",
    "libraries": { "": {} },
    "metadata": { "bytecodeHash": "ipfs" },
    "optimizer": { "enabled": true, "runs": 200 },
    "remappings": [],
    "outputSelection": {
      "contracts/teleporteth/contracts/TeleportTokenFactory.sol": {
        "TeleportTokenFactory": [
          "evm.bytecode.object",
          "evm.deployedBytecode.object",
          "metadata"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```
while this compiles:
```json
  "settings": {
    "evmVersion": "london",
    "libraries": { "": {} },
    "metadata": { "bytecodeHash": "ipfs" },
    "optimizer": { "enabled": true, "runs": 200 },
    "remappings": [],
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": { // <-- diff
        "TeleportTokenFactory": [
          "evm.bytecode.object",
          "evm.deployedBytecode.object",
          "metadata"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
```


## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.7 (originally), also tried 0.8.13
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): london
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): solc 
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04

## Steps to Reproduce
I am adding the full standard-json-input files with just the diff in the `outputSelection`. Also adding the `.sol` files for reference.
