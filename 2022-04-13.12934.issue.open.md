# [\#12934 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12934) `open`: More concise "Cheatsheet" page
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `good first issue`

## Page
- [Cheatsheet](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html#global-variables)
- [Units and Globally Available Variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html)

## Abstract
Currently the "Cheatsheet" page largely repeats the information already available in "Units and Globally Available Variables". This info is already concise and in effect we're just maintaining it in two places. Cheatsheet should have much less detail. Having information that's not as succintly described elsewhere would also be much more useful.

Here's what I think we should do:
- Remove excessive detail from the cheatsheet. If the info is only available there, move it to a different location.
    - [x] Notes/warnings should not be there
    - [ ] "Global Variables" section would be better off as a table.
    - [ ] Members of `address`, `type`, etc. should be in a separate section, not under "Global Variables".
    - [ ] The operator precedence should be under [Types > Operators](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#operators). Maybe it makes sense to have a copy here but that's also extra maintenance so I'd just move it.
    - [ ] I think that the list of keywords should be moved to "Units and Globally Available Variables". It does not fit that page perfectly but is a bit related.
- Add missing info
    - [ ] Members available on functions, errors, events.
    - [ ] Make sure that the list of "Global Variables" contains every item from "Units and Globally Available Variables"

I created a pull request with the notes section removed from the cheat sheet. Was that done correctly? @cameel
