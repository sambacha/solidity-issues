The keyword "mapping" is too long, is it possible to simplify it to "map"?

At this point the current name is pretty well entrenched. We could consider changing it if it had some bigger benefits or if the current name was really bad and confusing but simply shortening it is IMO not strong enough of a reason. It would just be an annoyance for existing users switching to newer versions.
