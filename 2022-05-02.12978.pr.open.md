@philbawa hi, how do I transfer BNB

This is looking really good already! We have to be careful to find a good balance between this being generic enough and not too complicated, but I would suggest the following items (that could maybe go into future pull requests):
 - implement this in optimized evm transform
 - use gas measurements and the "runs" parameter to decide whether or not to do the optimization
 - allow cases that are not exactly "enum-like" - for example it might not be such a big deal if some of the values are missing - we just use the same tag as the default case
 - think about how we could use this in the function dispatch - see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12650

Item 3 is now completed. Any range of cases spanning no more than 16 values is now supported by subtracting the minimum case if necessary (underflows desired), and empty cases are allowed to be stored in the pushed value, which jump to the default case.

I'm not sure if that was already your reason for the relative offsets, but if we use relative offsets and can ensure them to be at most 256, we can actually fit 32 cases in a single push constant instead of just 16.

Also, @ekpyron suggested that as an alternative, we could also use a fully fixed-layout jump table instead, which would allow us to have no restriction on the size. The downside is that it needs another jump for each case and 4 additional bytes per case
```
let x :=<switch value>
if ge(x, <max value>) { /* something else */ }
jump(add(<start>, mul(x, <byte size of case>)))
// for each case:
jumpdest
pushtag <actual tag>
jump
```

The primary reason I included relative offsets was to eliminate a conditional jump for gas savings, but you're right, we could fit up to 32 cases in a single push, especially when the cases are sparse. The reason I haven't done it that way yet is for architecture reasons: the jump table code itself is currently built in EVMCodeTransform, and I wanted to make the fewest assumptions about the addresses where the cases begin. For instance, if we were to handle 32 cases and a case's address is >= 256 from the default case, the compilation would fail when deciding the jump addresses because the relative offset would not fit in a single byte.

But the compilation could currently fail anyway with backward jumps because the offsets are relative. Those aren't possible with the unoptimized version since all non-default cases come after the default case, but maybe with the optimizer that will become an issue.

Is there a way I can shift the assembly code generation of the jump table to be done after the case addresses are known? That way we could then decide if we could fit 32 cases and also whether we need to handle backward jumps. The code size would vary, so I'm not sure how I would handle that properly, maybe by taking up the maximum possible size and using some instruction for no-ops if the actual size is less.

> fully fixed-layout jump table

Ha! That was my first idea. It is still limited by the range of the cases (we can't fit cases spanning a range of 20,000) and uses more gas (59 rather than 35), but if you have a larger range of cases it could be useful.
