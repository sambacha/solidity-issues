propose to reclassify as official feature, which will be usable when this is done:  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15

Ok, as it _is_ possible to access the input via `msg.data`, I guess it would be fair to allow the fallback function to return something. As the idea of the fallback function is to be called whenever the signature check failed, it can act as emulating several functions with different types. So it would make sense to let its internal return type be `bytes`, but the data is encoded as `(bytes)` but just taken raw, i.e. without the (0x20, length)-prefix.

As we now have inline assembly, I would prefer not to allow the fallback function to return data. If you must return data, you have to use inline assembly.
