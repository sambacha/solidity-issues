# [\#42 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/42) `closed`: Multiply return values not supported.

solc compiles the following:

```
    function ret() returns (int a, int b) { 
        a = 1;
        b = 2;
    }
```

But no ways to get both `a` and `b` from return data. That feature would be very handy in absence of Struct returns.

sorry I can't understand the problem. So your example is working now. you have a and b in return data. could you please rephrase your question

Sorry, I've probably missed something, but what is the syntax of calling such function and obtaining `a` and `b` from the returned data?

In my mind it should be something like

```
x, y = ret();
```

but that doesn't work

ah, sure. unfortunately  now you still can't do that, but you can return struct from internal function(don't forget to add "internal" specifier before "returns").
we have pending story to implement something like: var [a, b] = fun();
