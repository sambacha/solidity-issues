Tutorial has:

```
contract TokenCreator {
  function createToken(bytes32 name) returns (address tokenAddress) {
    // Create a new Token contract and return its address.
    return address(new OwnedToken(name));
  }
```

how does createToken work?  creating a contract requires eth_sendTransaction, but transactions don't have return values...

Contracts can create contracts. There's an op for it, you give it some code and it returns the address of the new contract. That's what the `new` keyword gets compiled to.
