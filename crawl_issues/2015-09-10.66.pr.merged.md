# [\#66 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/66) `merged`: Calling libraries.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2015-09-10 17:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/66):

This pull request adds the library feature. Libraries (`library lib { ... }`) are very similar to contracts, only that all of its functions are called via CALLCODE. Furthermore, this pull request introduces `AssemblyItem`s of the type `PushLibraryAddress` which push a virtual address that is only filled in after compilation in a linker stage. If the address of the library is not provided, solc will output the hex bytecode with placeholders of the form `__LibraryName____` that can also be replaced manually or at a later point.
The linker itself as an option to `solc` is not yet implemented.
