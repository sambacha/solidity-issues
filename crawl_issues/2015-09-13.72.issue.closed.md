It should be possible to declare different modifiers with the same name but different argument types, as it is possible for functions.

For example:
```
contract C {
  modifier m(uint a) { _; }
  modifier m(bytes b) { _; }
  modifier m(uint a, bytes b) { _; }
}
```

I see this've been open for 2 years but no activity. Anything on this regard?

I agree this is a desirable feature... Any other opinions on the matter?

Also maybe should it be possible for a modifier to have the same name as a function?

I think that is an idea which goes against the aim of code clarity.

Can a variable have the same name as a function? Can a class have the same name as a variable? Can a modifier have the same name as a struct? Is shadowing possible? Are any number of confusing things allowed?

There is active work against allowing shadowing, see the latest warnings about shadowing.

Does #3041 imply that we do want this and it's pending implementation?

because so far there was no clear response to this issue

No decision has been made on this yet.

+1 modifier overload would be super useful, e.g.:

```solidity
    modifier notPreviousBool(bool previous, bool current) {
        require(
            current != previous,
            "notPreviousBool: 'current' state must differ from the 'previous' one"
        );
        _;
    }
    modifier notPreviousUint256(uint256 previous, uint256 current) {
        require(
            current != previous,
            "notPreviousUint256: 'current' value must differ from the 'previous' one"
        );
        _;
    }
```

@aress31 well, that scenario can probably better solved with generics/templates something of the kind, which are also in discussion

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
