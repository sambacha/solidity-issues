If you change the type to "string" or "bytes" you get an assignment error:

"Type error: Type void is not implicitly convertible to expected type string storage pointer."

contract A { function f() constant returns (string) { } }
contract B { function f() { string anothervar = A(1).f(); } }

contract A { function f() constant returns (bytes) { } }
contract B { function f() { bytes anothervar = A(1).f(); } }

In these two cases, it appears that B thinks a "void" type should be coming back from A, when it's actually either "string" or "bytes". 

EDIT: This probably means that dynamically-sized arrays/bytes can't be passed, different from this issue's main bug. But I'll leave this comment here anyway.

@fivedogit I think your problem is described here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13
