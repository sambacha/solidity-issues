# [\#98 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/98) `closed`: [BUG] Struct arrays set the first element's first component to the array length.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8941225?u=aa1e0c466bb8df8ff2a96d134747895127cfaa7b&v=4" width="50">[rickmacgillis](https://github.com/rickmacgillis) opened issue at [2015-09-27 18:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/98):

When creating a struct array, the first element of the array will have the first component of the struct set to the length of the struct array.

```
contract test
{
    struct leader
    {
        uint256 winnings;
        address player;
    }

    leader[10] private leaderboard;

    /**
     * Get a list of leaders.
     * 
     * @return playersList address[]   The list of player addresses
     */
    function getLeaders() public constant returns(uint256[])
    {
        uint256 leaderboardLength = leaderboard.length;

        uint256[] winnings;
        winnings.length = leaderboardLength;

        for (uint8 i = 0; i < leaderboardLength; ++i) {
            winnings[i] = leaderboard[i].winnings;
        }

        return winnings;
    }
}
```

**The browser compiler says:** Returned: ["10","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"]

"player" from the struct is unaffected. Try reversing the components of the struct, then run the script. the result is: Returned: ["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"]. However, "player" will then have 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000a as the first address. (10 in hex)

**EDIT**
I've also tested what happens when setting the first item in the struct to something other than a 10 value. When changing that first element, it causes the compiler to crash, though when it's set to the 10 value, then it will function normally. After the "crash" the browser compiler reports the following in the console.

`Uncaught BigNumber Error: new BigNumber() not a base 16 number:`

I've found a work around for the buffer overflow issue. Define the struct as a dynamic array, then in the constructor, set the length of the struct array to the appropriate length.

_DEVS: Please do NOT close this ticket until the buffer overflow situation is resolved! My temporary fix is just an alternative way to write the code._

Thank you for your report!
This seems like a problem with a storage null pointer: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Tutorial#pitfalls
I have to admit that currently, what you are trying to achieve is not really easy to do, as we do not yet have dynamic memory arrays.

Yep. That was a poor choice of words on my part. What I meant is that the struct needs to be an uninitialized array. (0 size array using structArray[])

Could you please describe in more detail how you cause the compiler crash? Furthermore, which "buffer overflow situation" do you exactly mean above?

The buffer overflow appears as the segment of the storage data that stores the length of the array,  is appearing in the first element. When overwriting data that is meant to be outside of the scope of the array's contents, the compiler crashes.

The overflow is not a compiler bug, but a common pitfall when using arrays or structs in Solidity (we are currently working on reporting this as a warning): https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Tutorial#pitfalls You dereference a "null storage pointer" when you use `uint256[] winnings;` without assigning this local variable from a state variable first.
Concerning the crash: Could you please provide specific source code that causes the crash?

I'm not sure why it stopped "crashing" with the "Not a BigNumber" error. It was more accurate to say that it paused for a few seconds, then stated the error. the code in question is as follows.

```
function setLeader()
    {
        leaderboard[0].winnings = 5;
    }
```

Just add that to the above contract. Currently it just fails to change element 0 to a 5, though I can change element 1 to a 5.

It works great for me. Of course, you should not use the `getLeaders` function as written in the first comment because it still contains the "null storage pointer" bug - which is probably also the reason you think that it "fails to change element 0 to a 5". If you change `leaderboard` to `public`, you will see that it is set correctly.

I'm not sure if we're on the same page anymore. Let me recap where we stand. The following code fails to change element 0 to a 5 when you...
1. Create the contract.
2. Click the setLeader button.
3. Click the getLeaders button.

```
contract test
{
    struct leader
    {
        uint256 winnings;
        address player;
    }

    leader[10] public leaderboard;

    /**
     * Get a list of leaders.
     * 
     * @return playersList address[]   The list of player addresses
     */
    function getLeaders() public constant returns(uint256[])
    {
        uint256 leaderboardLength = leaderboard.length;

        uint256[] winnings;
        winnings.length = leaderboardLength;

        for (uint8 i = 0; i < leaderboardLength; ++i) {
            winnings[i] = leaderboard[i].winnings;
        }

        return winnings;
    }

    function setLeader()
    {
        leaderboard[0].winnings = 5;
    }
}
```

Also, As stated before, the following code avoids the null pointer bug.

```
contract test
{
    struct leader
    {
        uint256 winnings;
        address player;
    }

    leader[] private leaderboard;

    function test()
    {
        leaderboard.length = 10;
    }

    /**
     * Get a list of leaders.
     * 
     * @return playersList address[]   The list of player addresses
     */
    function getLeaders() public constant returns(uint256[])
    {
        uint256 leaderboardLength = leaderboard.length;

        uint256[] winnings;
        winnings.length = leaderboardLength;

        for (uint8 i = 0; i < leaderboardLength; ++i) {
            winnings[i] = leaderboard[i].winnings;
        }

        return winnings;
    }

    function setLeader()
    {
        leaderboard[0].winnings = 5;
    }
}
```

In response to changing the scope of "leaderboard" to "public," that doesn't have any bearing on the null pointer bug as witnessed by the first code block above.

In the lines

```
uint256[] winnings;
winnings.length = leaderboardLength;
```

you create a local variable of type "pointer to dynamic storage array of base type uint256" and this pointer is initialized as pointing to the first storage slot (everything is initialized to "zero").
Then you write to its `length` property. This causes the pointer to be dereferenced, i.e. the runtime assumes that there actually is a `uint256[]` array at the beginning of storage. As for dynamic arrays, the length is stored in the actual slot itself, you write the value of `leaderboardLength` to the first storage slot. Although the actual object that is stored at this slot is `leaderboard[0].winnings`. This is why that value is overwritten.
