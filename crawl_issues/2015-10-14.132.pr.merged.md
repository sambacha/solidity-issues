# [\#132 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/132) `merged`: Tuple expressions and destructuring assignments

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2015-10-14 22:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/132):

This allows to use tuple expressions -- `(1,2,x,f(),4)` or `return (1,2);` -- and destructuring assignments to pre-existing lvalues: `(x, y) = (1,2);`, `(data[7][y], z) = g(x);`
In the same way as with multi-variable declarations, wildcards are possible on the left hand side of an assignment: `(x,y,) = (1,2,3,4)` will assign `1` and `2`, whereas `(,x,y) = (1,2,3,4)` will assign `3` and `4`.
In order to distinguish between parenthesized expressions and a 1-tuple, use the notation `(7,)` to force a 1-tuple.

What we should warn users about:
The common idiom to use `(x,y) = (y,x)` to swap two values will fail when used with storage reference types as swapping them would require temporaries - which are not available in storage.

Fixes #9
which is seemingly unrelated by introducing an additional AST node to parenthesized expressions.
