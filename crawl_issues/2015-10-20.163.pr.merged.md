# [\#163 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/163) `merged`: File reorganisation.

Move all files in respective categories:

parsing: the scanner and parser
ast: abstract syntax tree and its annotations
analysis: name resolution and type checking
codegen: code generation
interface: interface, containing the "exports"

I am not sure if it is a good idea to still keep the directory `libsolidity` or just move everything to the root directory.
