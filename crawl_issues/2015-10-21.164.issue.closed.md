# [\#164 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/164) `closed`: cryptic type error for multiple return values

```

    function get() returns (bytes value, bool ok) {
        bytes memory val;
        return (val, true);
    }
}

contract MultiRetUser {

        var mr = new MultiReturner();
        bytes memory value;
        bool ok;
        (value, ok) = mr.get();
    }
}
```

```
lang/multiret_test.sol:14:23: Error: Type bool is not implicitly convertible to expected type tuple(bytes memory,bool).
        (value, ok) = mr.get();
                      ^
```

same error if I switch the order. No error if I use `bytes32` instead of `bytes`.

There is a story to improve this: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1189488/stories/103488704

I just realised that I should probably explain why this happens:
The EVM is unable to _read_ variably-sized data from external function calls. Because of that, such types are removed from the signature of functions.
Note that on the other hand, it is possible to _return_ variably-sized data, it just cannot be read from within the EVM.

I don't understand how this can be an EVM restriction, if it can read fixed-size data of arbitrary size when you know the type.

The only explanation I can think of is that the evm requires you to say the size of the calldata buffer for the return value when you are making the call. What happens if you just say that it has size 2^256, then parse the return value lengths yourself?

Chris,
can you please elaborate more on this? 
Does it mean that absolutely no EVM contracts (Solidity or others) can read returned dynamic type values from internal calls? 
Thanks!

Before making the call, you have to specify the location where the return value should be put (position and length). The problem is that you already have to pay for memory usage before you make the call, so just specifying 2**256 for the length will use up all your gas.

These restrictions are not specific to Solidity.

This is another argument for supporting a feature like 
`low_level_call( bytes calldata, uint buffer_size ) returns (bytes data, bool ok)` 
you can detect whether your dynamically-sized type is readable or not

So if there is a contract returning `int[]` I can use it only via ABI but have no chances to call it from another contract. Quite sad limitation.

@nmushegian `low_level_call` will not help here - because even with a low level call there is no way to reserve space in memory whose size depends on a value that is only computed in the function that is called.

@Nashatyrev you are right. We plan to remove this limitation in Ethereum 2.0.

What I meant was that I specify the size in the caller. I'm that if the callee tries to write too much to the return data, it just truncates it or crashes the transaction. So the caller should be able to interpret it as a dynamic array if I insist, if the array size is in the first word then I can check if it was too big and know that it failed. Then in the callee I just return `(bytes, bool)` and don't worry about the size.

Would it be possible to just get a better error message in the mean time? This seems like a common gotcha.
