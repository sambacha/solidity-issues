# [\#176 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/176) `merged`: First shot at generating why3 output.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2015-10-26 18:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/176):

This is a very preliminary prototype.
It allows formal verification of a [binary search routine](https://gist.github.com/chriseth/0c671e0dac08c3630f47).

The only supported types are `uint256` and `uint256[] memory`.
Why3 code can be injected for contracts, functions and before each statement using
`/// @why3 ...`

Some routines still need to be refactored to avoid problems with trailing semicolons especially in connection to if-else-statements without curly braces.
