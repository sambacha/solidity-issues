trying to access a contract from Angular.

```

when trying to log it

You need `uint public bar;` if you want to access the variable from outside.

Sorry. Typo corrected.

If this is still happening, then you probably did not create the JavaScript variable `foo` correctly. Please provide some more details.

I created foo with a constructor

```
contract foo {
 uint public bar;

  function foo () {
     bar = 0;
  }

  function addOne() {
    bar++;
  }
}

```

and then I try to see if it incremented. But I can't even get the value to return. What might be the case?

I think the problem lies in the JavaScript code you use to perform those operations.

Closing for now. Please reopen if it turns out to be a problem with Solidity.
