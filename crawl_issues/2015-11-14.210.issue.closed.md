# [\#210 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/210) `closed`: Support for path globbing in imports.

given some source:

```
import "SomeContractLib.sol";
```

We should be able to pass a directory to solc for it to be able to find the files needed without having to do something like:

```
import "some/file/path/that/may/not/be/portable/between/environments/SomeContractLib.sol";
```

Having to do the latter makes it difficult to do cross-environment testing of contracts where directories/compile scripts may not be called from the same paths.  Some of us don't use Mix as part of our workflow.

The current import mechanism is extremely crude and will soon be replaced by a much more flexible framework. Do I understand you correctly that you would like to have something similar to what `-I` does for c compilers?

@chriseth That's exactly what I wanted.

I don't see the changes?  Was this a mistake to close?

Oh sorry about the confusion. I closed it because it is a feature request, which are tracked in https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1189488 and not as github issues.
