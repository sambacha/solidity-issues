# [\#220 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/220) `closed`: A for loop is not considered a scope of its own
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2015-11-16 18:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/220):

The following code won't compile stating the variable _i_ is redeclared:

``` js
        for (uint i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
        }
        for (uint i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
        }
```

Either of these work:

``` js
        for (uint i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
        }
        for (i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
        }
```

and

``` js
        for (i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
        }
        for (uint i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
        }
```

This means it might be related (or be the same) to the this problem: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/219

However, going a step further, the following fails too:

``` js
        for (uint i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
            uint tmp;
        }
        for (i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
            uint tmp;
        }
```

Removing the second _tmp_ declaration and just referencing it works. This might suggest the _for_ loop is not considered a separate scope.

Is this desired behaviour or a bug?

This behaviour is inherited from javascript. Leaving this open as a reminder to document it better.

Documented in #557.

I just encountered this issue and was confused by it. I don't think Solidity should inherit this behavior from JavaScript. First of all, JavaScript is fixing this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let. Second, Solidity is very far from JavaScript now (for example, not using prototypes like JS does); JS is no longer a suitable model for the language.

We are also planning to introduce `let`.
