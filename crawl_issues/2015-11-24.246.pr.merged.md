# [\#246 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/246) `merged`: Refactoring - more flexible contracts.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2015-11-24 16:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/246):

This is a refactoring aiming towards adding "using x for y".
It contains the following changes:
1. Sub-nodes of contracts are not stored by their type anymore, this makes it easier to add new AST nodes and also to expand the notion of a scope to non-contracts.
2. If a type has changing members depending on the context, the context is only supplied when the members are computed.

DEPENDS:
{
"mix": "membersContextSensitive"
}
