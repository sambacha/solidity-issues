seemingly no. is it possible to add this feature or is there some fundamental blocker?

This has already been added to the documentation and it does indeed say that you can so long as the internal modifier is appended.

@VoR0220 thanks for responding

the docs have this to say:

> internal:
> Those functions and state variables can only be accessed internally (i.e. from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it), without using this.

https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contracts.html?highlight=internal#visibility-and-accessors

The original question is

> can a struct be passed to _another_ contract?

So it seems the answer is that it is **not** possible. This brings me back to my subsequent question,

> is it possible to add this feature or is there some fundamental blocker?

wow, silly me...missed that part. I don't think that there isn't a true fundamental blocker...it's just getting the pieces properly aligned. Currently waiting on a struct object in the web3 calls to help with this or last I discussed structs with @chriseth .

Adding structs as ABI types make that possible and it is quite high on our backlog.
