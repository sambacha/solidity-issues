# [\#306 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/306) `merged`: Flesh out naming convention in the Style Guide

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/824194?v=4" width="50">[pipermerriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam) opened issue at [2015-12-16 23:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/306):

### What does this do?

This fills out the naming convention section in the [style guide](http://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/style-guide.html) section of the documentation.
### How did I come up with these conventions?

This part of the document is largely transcribed from [it's counterpart in pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).
### The `modifier` naming convention

I would specifically like to point out the naming convention for function modifiers because I chose a different convention than has been used in all code examples, documentation, etc.  Instead of suggesting the use of `onlyowner` the style guide instead would have it named `only_owner`.

I have trouble coming up with exactly why this seemed appropriate.  My general thought was that it should be easier to read and would prevent confusion when the words being used easily run together and it isn't immediately clear where the word break should be.  I've not been able to think of a good example of this but I know it's out there.

Although this was started with pep8, I think Solidity (and new code written in Solidity) should try to be more consistent with Javascript, ie mixedCase and rare uses of underscores (I agree with underscores for A_CONSTANT and modifiers like only_owner).  Developers are likely to have to write Javascript (for their frontends), so minimizing a different style for their "backend" and contracts seems like a win.

:+1: to mixedCase. The names of functions will appear on the abi on the javascript side, so having a consistant trans-layer naming scheme is a plus.

mixedCase +1

I am for mixedcase for the same reasons listed by @Smithgift

I'll get it updated to mixedCase. Thanks for the feedback

+1 for mixedCase also from me.

Concerning trailing underscore for disambiguation: Is that visible enough? I.e. should I use `x.send_(2)` in order not to collide with the pre-defined `send`?

I think the most controversial decision will be whether and how state variables should be marked specially. Probably not for this PR but it could be good to already make up your mind about that :-)

+1 to mixedCase FTW...improved readeability, the little things makes all the difference esp when going through code forrests

@innovator256 @chriseth @Souptacular @janx @ethers @Smithgift 

Updated to specify `mixedCase` for function and variable names.
