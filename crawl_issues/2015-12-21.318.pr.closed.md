Still a bit of work needing to be done, but for @chriseth 's sake...I've put these here so that we can use them as a reference. Anybody who has any recommendations on how to go about these is welcome. Currently, I am having problems getting an array type to be properly made...I think this may call for a new way to declare an array type, but I need advice on what would be the best way to go about this since I see the way that types are stored is a special object.

Please rebase, this PR contains too many unrelated changes.
Furthermore, it would be nice not to include non-working commits.
