Most of the functionalities should be there, I'm thinking about possible corner cases.

I added several new test cases, they can all pass.

May want to try rerunning this through Jenkins...I can't find any details on a failed test.

EDIT: Upon further review...it appears to be a problem with memory allocation in Whisper...not sure how this might have caused that to fail. Ideas?

you want to rerun this. I ran a test case PR just for the sake of checking to make sure this would properly work and it went through. Try opening another PR.

@VoR0220 Yes, it's a bit odd, I believe it's a build environment issue...
