Thanks for the pull request! I'll add some comments.

The fact that `a ? x : y = z` has different semantics in different javascript implementations is worrying. In nodejs, it executes but does not have an effect on either `x` or `y`, in firefox, it assigns to `x` if `a` is true.
We should check the ecmascript 6 specification before finalizing the operator priority and other things in this change.

It seems my initial investigation was wrong. Assignment in the form of `(a ? b : c) = d` is not allowed in JavaScript, but I would not care about that and make sure that it works in Solidity. On the other hand, `a ? b : c = d` should evaluate to the same as `a ? b : (c = d)`.

It would be great if you could also change the documentation:
https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#control-structures (it is generated from a file in this source tree in the `docs` directory).

@chriseth I'm disabling conditional expression as left value right now. Because with some digging, it's a little more than I expected, because the current `m_currentLValue` is determined at compile time, but for this conditional expression, it has to be determined at runtime. So we might need to delayed codegen, and what's worse `(true ? a : b)[0]` where `a` is an arry. There has to be some changes in ``LValue.cpp` I'm afraid, I need to put more thoughts on it.

So this PR only supports conditional expression as the right value.

You are right, especially things like the following could be difficult (the type is exactly the same, but the lvalues have to be treated very differently):

```
contract c {
  uint x;
  uint[] y;
  function f(bool s) {
    (s ? x : y.length) = 7;
  }
}
```

JavaScript does not have it, so we do not need it.

We should add a  button somewhere to trigger the failed build again.

I tried pulling this and testing it out with just a test contract: 

```
contract c {
    function f() {
        uint x = 12; 
        uint y = 14;

        string S = (x == y) ? "Hello" : "World";

    }
}
```

This throws two errors:

```
testingConditionals.sol:6:14: Error: True expression's type literal_string "Hello" doesn't match false expression's type literal_string "World".
        string S = (x == y) ? "Hello" : "World";
                   ^--------------------------^
testingConditionals.sol:6:3: Error: Type literal_string "Hello" is not implicitly convertible to expected type string storage pointer.
        string S = (x == y) ? "Hello" : "World";
        ^-------------------------------------^
```

I don't think this is how it is supposed to work. Let me know if anybody else is getting this as well.

Hi @VoR0220, thanks for trying out. It's because I'm reusing binary operator comparison (==) as to detect whether the true expression matches the false expression, and it turns out our solidity doesn't support

```
"hello" == "world"
```

What's why you got the error at first place, it seems I need to manually handle these cases instead of reusing existing functions.

I tried more test cases and find another failed case:

```
test.sol:64:17: Error: True expression's type tuple(int_const 1,int_const 2) doesn't match false expression's type tuple(int_const 3,int_const 4).
                true ? (1, 2) : (3, 4);
                ^--------------------^
```

I'll fix these two cases.

As far as I know you do _not_ use the comparison operator to check for equal types, you rather use `Type::commonType` to infer it. The reason it does not work is because you actually first have to convert trueType and falseType to their mobile types and then compute the common type.
This should fix both the literal string and the tuple case.

@chriseth Actually in this implementation, I first check against `Type::commonType` then if it fails, try the binary operator. It means `Type::commonType` doesn't cover the string literal.

I'm trying to fix it by listing the different cases manually here.

@guanqun did you try the suggestions I made concerning determining the common type?

```
    TypePointer trueType = type(_conditional.trueExpression())->mobileType();
    TypePointer falseType = type(_conditional.falseExpression())->mobileType();

    TypePointer commonType = Type::commonType(trueType, falseType);
```

@chriseth Now I'm getting mobile type first and then find the common type of these two. Basically it works fine, but still in this case it doesn't work quite nicely:

```
contract C {
    function f(bool cond) returns(bytes32) {
        return cond ? "hello" : "world";
    }
}
```
- The true expression and false expression are both string literals.
- But according to the new implementation, the common type of mobile types is `ArrayType`.
- This `ArrayType` can't be implicitly converted to `bytes32`
- Actually string literal should be converted to `bytes32`.

The error message is:

```
test.sol:3:10: Error: Return argument type string memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type (type of first return variable) bytes32.
        return cond ? "hello" : "world";
               ^----------------------^
```

I'd like to tackle this issue by checking this case specifically (two string literals), and mark the return type of this conditional expression also as a string literal, with the maximum length of these two, adding another field in `StringLiteralType`. 

I'd like to get your idea on this.

The problem is that string literals can be converted into `string`, `bytes` and `bytesXX` (only if they are short enough). As type conversions are only aware of the immediate context (i.e. the other string literal is visible but not the target of the assignment which is one further node away in the expression graph), we only get a `string` or `bytes`.

I'm not sure adding special cases for the ternary operator is a clean way to fix this. One option would be to make `bytesXX` the mobile type for string literals that are short enough and allow `bytesXX` to be implicitly convertible to `bytes` and `string`. This will allow all `bytesXX` types to be convertible to `string` which is probably not a good idea. We might add another flag to `bytesXX` and `bytes` to indicate that the types actually could also be a valid string and allow conversion only in those cases.

In any case, I think that this should be postponed for a different user story.

I follow your approach to make `bytesXX` the mobile type for string literals and allow it to be implicitly convertible to `bytes` and `string`, but still there are lots of cases failed.

I need to understand more about the relationship between these types before I randomly hack on this.

So for now, I'll close this PR.

I don't think this tiny shortcoming is a reason not to accept this PR. We should add the operator now and worry about these edge cases separately, they are not only relevant for `?:`.

OK. Now I commented out the string literal test case, and all test cases can pass.

I'll fix this issue eventually after I sorted out all the type conversion rules...

Since if I take the approach to make `bytesXX` the mobile type for string literals, I have to comment more test cases.

I'm hesitant to add the 'looks good' label to it. That optimizer bug is a pretty big problem. I'm going to wait for advice from @chriseth on this one. The optimizer isn't my forte.

The optimizer is implemented in the libethereum submodule. If you update that to latest develop, the error should go away.
