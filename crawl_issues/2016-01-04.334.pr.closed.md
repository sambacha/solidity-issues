# [\#334 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/334) `closed`: support the syntax "(x) = 3"

The tuple expression is decayed, it only has one component, it's slightly different with "(x,) = (3,)"'s syntax.

We have to support this because conditional expression "(true ? x : y) = 3" would use this syntax.

Please see the following transcript of a browser javascript console:

```
> var x = 1
undefined
> var y = 2
undefined
> 1 ? x : y = 5
1
> x
1
> y
2
```

So it already works like `(1 ? x : y) = 5` - solidity should behave equally.

The pull request itself, though, looks good.
Waiting with merging until test runner is working again.

We should fix the build checks... It happens all the time...

I'll create a new PR.
