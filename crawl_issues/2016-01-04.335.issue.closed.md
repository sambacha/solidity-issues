# [\#335 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/335) `closed`: Array Not working

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5847791?v=4" width="50">[rkaveti1](https://github.com/rkaveti1) opened issue at [2016-01-04 16:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/335):

I am unable to get this to work when I add this line to the code - 
        funders[funders.length++] = Funder({addr: sender, amount: amount});
If I comment this array, it starts working. Is there a issue with using arrays when using geth?

thanks
Rajesh

```
contract Crowdsale
 {
    address public beneficiar;
    uint public fundingGoal; uint public amountRaised; uint public deadline; uint public price;
    uint public tokenVal;
    //mapping (address => uint) public coinBalanceOf;
    event CoinTransfer(address sender, address receiver, uint amount);
    struct Funder {
        address addr;
        uint amount;
    }
    Funder[] public funders;

    function Crowdsale(address _beneficiary, uint _fundingGoal, uint _duration, uint _price) {
        beneficiar = _beneficiary;
        deadline = now + _duration * 1 minutes;
        price = _price;

    }

    function fundTransfer(address receiver, address sender, uint msgValue) {
        uint amount = msgValue;
        amountRaised += amount;
        tokenVal = amount/price;
// if this line is commented - then it starts working.
        funders[funders.length++] = Funder({addr: sender, amount: amount});

        CoinTransfer(receiver, sender, tokenVal);

    }

    modifier afterDeadline() { if (now >= deadline) _ }

}


/// watchers
 var event = crowdsale.CoinTransfer({}, '', function(error, result){
            if (!error)
        console.log("Coin transfer: " + result.args.amount +  " tokens "  + result.args.receiver + " receiver " +  result.args.sender + " beneficiary " )
        });


 crowdsale.fundTransfer.sendTransaction(eth.accounts[0],eth.accounts[2], 1000, {from: eth.accounts[1]})
```

This does not look like a solidity bug. Could you try to simplify the code and test it using browser-solidity?

Closing for now. Please reopen if it persists.
