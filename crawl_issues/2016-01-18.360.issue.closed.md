I ran a test for the SHA3 bug just to make sure it would work normally, and it appears it does not. This:

```
contract C { 
            struct S {
                uint8[3] a;
            }
            function f() returns (uint8) {
                S memory s = S([1, 2, 3]);
                return (s.a[1]);
            }
        }
```

should return 2, but it appears it does not. Will need to fix.

another user error (silly me forgot the semicolon). Closing.
