# [\#362 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/362) `closed`: sha3 output is not per SHA-3 standard

Solidity's `sha3` function does not return hashes per the SHA-3 (FIPS 202) standard.  This is a tracking issue for a Solidity function that does return SHA-3 output.

It returns a Keccak hash with the original padding. It is mentioned in the Yellow paper too. It might make sense proposing an EIP to rename the method or to include a `keccak` opcode too, but it is not as simple as that given how widely it is used.

If I understand this correctly, this is about providing a compiler-generated function that computes the sha3 hash function per the FIPS 202 standard. If such a function is needed, it has to be either implemented in some languages that compiles to EVM (and can be used as a library) or has to be added as a precompiled contract as a hard fork.
