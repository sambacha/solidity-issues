so the name of this is a bit deceiving, there's really only one fix, that being for storage structs. However, I have added a plethora of tests (including ones that should have been there to begin with) and have added a function for StructTypes for ease of implementing this fix, as well as internal compiler errors for all currently non working types. Please be sure to read the devnotes...these are the critical areas where I was struggling to find a fix that would not upset the rest of the compiler. Let's merge this in the mean time and work on a more long term solution in the next version.

Going to leave this here for now in case for some reason the Structs as part of the ABI story fails the SHA3 tests (and I'm going to make the request that in some way shape or form that the tests from this PR are included...even if commented out).

closing for now, will come back for the tests once the Struct ABI is being implemented.
