# [\#366 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/366) `closed`: Doc parsing: Multiple return value support, way to dev-doc contracts

These are some features that would be nice when generating documentation using the natspec format.

First it would be great if return-values worked like params, meaning you get an object with name -> description mappings. Right now it ends up being a single string. 

Example:

```
/// @return contractAddress the contract address.
/// @return error an error code.
function getContract(bytes32 id) constant returns (address contractAddress, uint16 error);
```

Object would be:

```
{
    "contractAddress": "the contract address",
    "error": "an error code"
}
```

Multiple return values does work, but they will only be appended after one another without a separator. In this case it would be the string:

`contractAddress the contract addresserror an error code`

Right now I solve it by adding a `|` at the end of return values if i have more then one, then split and parse them manually.

Currently you can't add a `@dev` tag to a contract. It will not end up in the `.docdev` json file under `details`, like it does in functions. That would be very nice. 

Using: `Version: 0.2.0-67c855c5/RelWithDebInfo-Linux/g++/int linked to libethereum-1.1.0-34716679/.-Linux/g++/int` (built yesterday i believe).

By the way - Might I suggest removing documentation compiler errors (unless --devdoc or --userdoc flags are used, or by adding a --ignoredoc flag or something). That way those of us who wants to produce professional looking doc pages using external tools can do that without having to break with natspec.

Come to think of it, a flag wouldn't really help as it would still catch the errors that unknown flags produce when building the user and devdocs. Scratch that...

Actually, no. Is devdoc even used in the natspec validation process in the clients?
