I wonder why it failed. Perhaps there are some tests that need checking on first before you merge this?

it failed probably because there were no tests for this at all?  Change looks fine, and of course nicer if there were tests, but since this code shouldn't really ever change anymore, then the tests can be deferred.

@ethers actually about to undergo a pretty major change in preparation for the RealNxM datatype. But we'll cross that bridge when we get there.
