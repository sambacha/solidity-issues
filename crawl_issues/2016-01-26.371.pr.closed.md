# [\#371 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/371) `closed`: Real data type token list

This is currently setting up the real data type by having a redo of the token list (putting in all the different combinations for the Real Data type would mean that we couldn't have all of our tokens in under a byte...so I'm setting it up so that is no longer an issue). Currently this is causing tons upon tons of tests to fail, currently counting at about 373 (wowza!), I am looking for pointers on where to look and what I could do better with the current implementation. Let me know your thoughts. This post will most likely be updated when it starts to come together.

Another idea: You could also replace the `Token::Value` members in `ElementaryTypeName` and `ElementaryTypeNameExpression` by a more complex class that itself has M and N members. This class can then also include a constructor from string and then be used by fromElementaryTypeName(string).

@chriseth can you elaborate on your idea? I'm trying to make sure I understand.
