The final put together work for a redone token list so that from here we can build the real data type or any number of different keywords we may want to add into the language. Enjoy :) real will be coming shortly.

Please clean up your pull request (squash commits until you arrive at a small number of coherent changesets) and do not include large sections of code that is commented out.

I do not think it is a good idea to just "abuse" identifier as elementary type names. The scanner should report a token of `uintN` for e.g. `uint64`. Please also add a test that checks that `uintN` is a valid identifier (because I think currently, it could be parsed as a different token).

Sorry for hijacking the thread, but what is the final decision on encoding of the realMxN type?

@axic By decision you are referring to what choices? I don't believe I am aware of what decision there was to be made, sad to say.

@VoR0220 I've just never seen a final specification on how to encode it for ABI purposes. And that usually matches how Solidity represents it in the contract memory.

@axic so...I've been somewhat going off of it as described here, but I'm having difficulty figuring out exactly how we're going to do it. https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Contract-ABI

@axic the encoding is part of the abi spec.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) commented at [2016-02-03 16:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/377#issuecomment-179323319):

If strictly following what's written there:

> `real<N>x<M>`: fixed-point signed number of N+M bits, 0 < N + M <= 256, N % 8 == M % 8 == 0.  Corresponds to the int256 equivalent binary value divided by 2^M.
> 
> `ureal<N>x<M>`: unsigned variant of `real<N>x<M>`.

Let's say V is the value to be encoded, Vn is the value of N-width and Vm is the value of M-width. In the binary representation Vn is the MSB part. Then it should be:

Vn = V / (2^M)
Vm = V % (2^M)

and therefore

V = Vn \* (2^M) + Vm

I might have misunderstood it entirely - it might just say to drop the decimal part?

The above still leaves the signed real type as a question. Just the above on the two's complement representation? Or the output of the above run through two's complement?

@chriseth but is it fully documented?

@axic that is a bit further down in the ABI portion....still trying to figure all of this out tbh with you.

@axic If you want to encode `1.5` is a `fixed128x128`, you multiply it with `2**128`, interpret that as an integer (round it) and encode it as you would encode a `uint256`. So you get `0x180000000000000000000000000000000` (lower-order aligned).

The same rules should apply for signed numbers: `-1.5` is encoded in the same way as `-1.5 * 2**128`, i.e. as `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff80000000000000000000000000000000`

Thanks @chriseth.

This does raises a question: what is the point defining it as `(u)realMxN` and not just `(u)realN` if you say encode as `uint256`.

Will it eventually be encoded as `(u)intM+N`, e.g `ureal64x128` as `uint192`?

@axic I think this discussion benefits from being done via gitter :) Let's get together there!
