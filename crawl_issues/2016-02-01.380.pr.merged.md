The Ubuntu part of the installation guide mentions `libjson-rpc-cpp-dev`. However, the correct name seems to be `libjsonrpccpp-dev`.

Thanks for the pull request! The name of the package seems to have changed from wily on: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libjsonrpccpp-dev
Could you add that to the PR, please?

I'm happy to update the documentation with some additional information. However, I can't seem to find a package called `libjson-rpc-cpp-dev` for older versions of Ubuntu [either](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=default&section=all&arch=any&keywords=libjson-rpc-cpp-dev&searchon=names), seems weird (it should show up in the search, no?).

Ah, it seems that this is part of our ppa: http://ppa.launchpad.net/ethereum/ethereum/ubuntu/pool/main/libj/libjson-rpc-cpp/ but it only extends until trusty. So for up to vivid, you get it from our ppa, otherwise you get the differently named package from the ofificial ubuntu repository.

Thanks for the info, I updated the doc accordingly.
