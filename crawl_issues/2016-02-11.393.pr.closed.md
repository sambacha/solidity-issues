Almost there...there is one test that is giving me a problem. I will rebase once this is up and working, but for now it would seem that getting this working is a priority...and currently I'm stumped as to why this isn't working.

I've changed the string around numerous times...but here's what I keep getting particularly with my latest test.

here's the latest test (to test the assumption of there being a number bug):

```
contract test {
            function f() {
                uint8 uint7 = 3;
                uint7 = 5;
                string uintM = "Hello you";
                uint bytesM = 21;
            }
        }
```

```
fixed.sol:5:5: Error: Type literal_string "Hello you" is not implicitly convertible to expected type string storage pointer.
```

one thing to note...this is only happening with string and bytes. It's not happening when called via uint or int.

actually think this may be related to something else. Trying final test.
