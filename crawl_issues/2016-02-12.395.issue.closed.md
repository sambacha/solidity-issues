**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

There's all sorts of weird things in Solidity that don't seem intuitive. Things like why a large uint is going to be more efficient gas wise than a small uint unless tightly packed into a struct. I think that much of the community could benefit from these things being well explained and for certain "best practices" to be made available in the documentation.

I am also struggling with all kinds of gas problems. I have many doubts about gas comsumption, how many parameters a function can have, what is the size in kbytes that a contract can have.. that kind of stuff..

I wouldn't worry about kbytes.

@VoR0220:

Is this a duplicate of #509 ?

If not, in the current state this is a bit vague. Can you collect some examples you would like to have documented?

That is tied in but I would say this is the bigger picture. Moreso documentation of simple patterns and what their base gas cost is, but probably would be better to show that via the opcodes, and then move onto simple operations (assigning a uint, state storage of a tightly packed cost, when or when not is it worth it).

I think it would be better to either have a list of patterns/quirks to be documented in this issue, or to open individual issues with those.

Someone then can easily pick up documenting them.

great idea. Lets start with tight packing with structs and state variables.
