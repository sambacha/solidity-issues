New keywords for inline assembly and fixed point types should be introduced with the 0.3.0 release. These include:

`fixed`, `ufixed` and their `MxN` variants.
`assembly`
`inline` (for future use)

@LianaHus please ask @VoR0220 for a partial PR of his that only includes the `fixed` / `ufixed` keywords. Make sure to align merging these changes as close to the switch to version 0.3.0 as possible.
