Is that all we need? Don't we need additional checks in `Token::fromIdentifierOrKeyword` so that e.g. `fixed8000x2` is not parsed as a keyword but `fixed8x8` is?

Ah, you wanted those in there too. I figured you only wanted the keywords and we could handle the fromIdentifier package when we actually implement fixed. But I suppose we can do that here too.

just realized...if an invalid argument gets thrown in extractUnsigned for a bytes type, it might actually be able to make it through. Going to change this to a zero.

Please also add `timestamp` as a new keyword (it will be a type).

either we need to pick a different name for timestamp or we need to redo something in the compiler because currently it's causing a conflict with `block.timestamp` if it's set as a keyword type. No problems if it's a non-keyword type.
