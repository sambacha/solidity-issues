strange...that seems to be an older one. Let me clarify with the newer docs.

Hi @VoR0220, any updates so far? M.b. any other method to send weis with constructor?

I can confirm that this is indeed the case that it is throwing an error, but whether or not it is supposed to I am not sure.

This is a bit weird, but cannot be improved. The right way to do it is `(new B).value(10)()` - please see https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Changelog#020-2015-12-02
@VoR0220 do you want to add an entry to the faq for that?

Just curious though...are you sure there is no way to improve that? Every time you say that you know it just makes me want to prove you wrong :)
