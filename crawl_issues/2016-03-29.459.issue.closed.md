@chriseth we need to either merge that branch now or we need to unmerge the evm and lll

These errors are unrelated to inline assembly. Did you update libethereum to latest develop?

doing that now

I am very much looking forward to the repo-reorg :-)
Decoupling will be very, very good for us.

yup. That did it. Although...unrelated note...webthree itself is failing (is this supposed to happen)?

Build breaks in Jenkins, you mean?   @chriseth and I are working through them.    What are you seeing?   And it's in a local build?    You are at HEAD on everything?   Please say yes :-)

I am on local build and yes I am on head in everything. Right after Solidity builds just fine, webthree dies.

@VoR0220 can this be closed?

Yep. @bobsummerwill let me try to reproduce a little bit later. I'll send a message to you.
