OK - so you're trying a more minimal set of changes now?   And will keep iterating on this until it builds?
Good good.

solidity builds fine already. need another pr to webthree-helpers.
but there is still one more dependence on libethereum in solidity test. 

alethzero depends on both solidity and libethereum thus it has redefenition problems
with evmcore constants

Yes, I don't think we can remove the dependencies from the tests.

perhaps it is better to rename the constants inside solidity? then solidity tests and alethzero would not have redefinition problems

Yes, maybe just re-namespacing.

just move it from dev::eth  to dev::solidity is fine?

That makes sense to me.

This PR and the commits should be renamed.

The aim here is to duplicate the subset of evmasmcore used in solidity, to minimize our dependencies onto cpp-ethereum.     We'll still be stuck with a pretty meaty dependency ONLY in the tests, and it looks like we're going to have some dependencies onto devcore (typedefs, etc) remaining to be tackled over time, but they should be very stable and unchanging ones.

http://doublethinkco.github.io/cpp-ethereum-cross/images/dependency_graph.svg

So the new info here is that there appear to be `ethcore` dependencies in solidity **as well**?   Are those only in the solidity tests?    I would be surprised if we couldn't build Solidity without that dependency if `-DTESTS=Off` is passed on the command-line.   @winsvega?

the main solidity evmcore is still depend on eth::ethcore
