# [\#473 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/473) `merged`: Update installing-solidity.rst

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2096352?v=4" width="50">[AlwaysBCoding](https://github.com/AlwaysBCoding) opened issue at [2016-04-03 01:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/473):

The brew install boost --c++11 command failed for me due to an outdated version of Node.js.

`brew upgrade` fixed this. I think it should be in the documentation to reduce the number of errors on install
