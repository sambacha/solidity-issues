```
brew uninstall cpp-ethereum
brew install cpp-ethereum
```

gives me the same result

Build jsoncpp from latest master branch - result is the same

Just checked on a clean Yosemite - the same error

On `El Captain` `solc` works perfectly fine after installing with Homebrew. 
In both cases the same `jsoncpp 1.6.5` is used and on both systems there is no such symbol as `__ZN4Json5ValueaSERKS0_` exported by this lib.

@bobsummerwill do you have an idea here?

Took the `libjsoncpp.dylib` from this package https://build.ethdev.com/cpp-binaries-data/release-1.2.3/Ethereum.dmg and, it contains missing symbol:

```
46-20-235-13:solc3 admin$ nm -gU libjsoncpp.dylib | grep Valuea
000000000000e844 T __ZN4Json5ValueaSERKS0_
```

After replacing the lib everything worked fine.

sounds like a problem with the updated brew.

From Gitter ...

That is really weird, @Nashatyrev! I wonder if there is some pre-processor magic going on? Some one of those DYLIBs has some extra symbols. I know we hit something before, though I think it was with cryptopp, where there was some issue with the minimum target architecture, like building for SSE2 or not, which resulted in different binaries where this kind of thing happened on one OS X version and not others.

Where does the libjsoncpp.dylib replacement file go?  I was able to download the dmg and find the libjsoncpp.dylib using 'Show Package Contents' from Finder.  

I'm receiving a Segmentation fault: 11 when using ethminer -G and/or ethminer -C and hopefully this will fix the issue if I can replace the file.

@bobsummerwill is this fixed?

I believe so, yes.
