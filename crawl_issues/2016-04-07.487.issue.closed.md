currently this compiles:

```
contract c {
    function selfdestruct(address recipient) {
        //do something
        suicide(recipient);
    }

    function suicide(address recipient){
        selfdestruct(recipient); // I want this 'suicide' to be the core one
    }
}
```

these are keywords, and if my understanding is correct, they should not be allowed in function bodies.

No, they are not keywords, they are only functions in the global scope.
