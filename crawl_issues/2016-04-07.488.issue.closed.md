# [\#488 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/488) `closed`: Error message: Assembly can't access storage variables by name

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-04-07 21:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/488):

This fails:

```
    uint b;
    function a() {
        assembly {
            b := 1
        }
    }
```

with `Error: Identifier "b" not found, not unique or not lvalue.`

This works:

```
    uint b;
    function a() {
        uint _b;
        assembly {
            _b := 1
        }
        b = _b;
    }
```

Well basically there's no way to access storage variables by name?

Also separately, using `sstore` returns an error message which could be improved:

```
    bytes b;
    function a() {
        assembly {
            sstore(b, 1)
        }
    }
```

It says: `Error: Expected instruction(s) to deposit 1 item(s) to the stack, but did deposit 2 item(s).`

(`sstore` expects a storage location)

It is actually all in the documentation: https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#assignments
You cannot assign to storage variables, you have to use `sstore`, this is due to the low-level nature of inline assembly, `:=` _always_ translates into a swap/pop combination.

The docs also say that if you access state variables in an rvalue context, the will occupy two slots on the stack: https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#access-to-external-variables

I don't see a way how to improve the error message and still retain the flexibility of the inline assembly system itself. If you want, you can add that to the FAQ, though.

In case 1) the error (if possible) should say something along the lines of `Indentifier "b" is a storage location. It cannot be used directly in inline assembly.`

In the case of `sstore(b, 1)` and `sload(b)` I think using `b` should refer to the storage location. Similarly how memory locations are handled in inline assembly.

I agree that the error message could be improved, but there are actually a number of other identifiers that are not available like this in inline assembly. I'll think about it.

For the second part of your comment above: The problem is that `b` takes 33 bytes (32 bytes for the storage location plus one byte for the offset inside the storage slot). It could be an option to remove the intra-slot offset if it is zero, but that will complicate the rules, I would say.

To clarify:
- any storage variable which has an offset (i.e. is smaller than 256 bits) will have both the storage location + offset on the stack
- any variable which is at least 256 bits wide will have its location on the stack - therefore case 3 above could/should work

Having a proper error message printed in case 1 would be useful, but perhaps it requires too many changes regarding processing.
