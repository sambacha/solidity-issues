You are running the code in a pre-homstead VM. Code generated from solidity version 0.3.0 onwards needs homestead changes.

I was running `geth 1.3.5` which is post-homestead but on `testnet`.  Upgraded to `geth 1.3.6` but still getting the same issue.

Are you past the homestead block on the testnet?
