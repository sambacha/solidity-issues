# [\#500 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/500) `closed`: Payable as a parameter in the ABI interface JSON

It is planned to have a modifier for functions explicitly enabling or disabling receiving value transfer (transactions where `msg.value != 0`).

If that becomes implemented it would be make sense including that as a flag in the interface JSON, e.g: `"payable": true`

This has been renamed to `payable`.

We want that for 0.4.0 don't we? If yes, please add the "nextrelease" tag.
