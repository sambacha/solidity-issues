# [\#510 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/510) `closed`: ABI dispatcher security consideration
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

The dispatcher parses the ABI signature and jumps to the specific tags, then the methods use `calldataload` again to load the specific arguments.  Would it make sense checking for the length of the supplied data with `calldatasize` that it meets the minimum required? Maybe when an optional keyword is used on the contract, like `safe`:

```
safe contract Test {
}
```

In the case of fixed-length types that is a constant number. In the case of dynamic arguments, that would be the minimum length it would take.

Solidity currently works under the assumption that you can shorten the call data if ends in zeros.

How about `strictabi` or `strictcall` instead of `safe`?

Perhaps it would be placed after the contract name:

```
contract Test strictabi {
}
```

Please explain how this is a security problem. The ABI is defined with the assumption that trailing zeros are ignored or can be omitted. This creates a "malleability" risk when using `msg.data`. On the other hard, `msg.data` provides low-level access and we also have this malleability risk when using non-32-byte-types.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
