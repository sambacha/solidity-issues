# [\#516 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/516) `closed`: test solidity via json-rpc

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-04-21 10:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/516):

This requires us to modify the `ExecutionFramework` class in the following way:
- we need access to return values but also require permanent changes to the state. In order to achieve that, we might first use only a `call` to get the execution result, but store the transaction. If another call is made in the same test suite, we send the previous transaction again in a `sendTransaction` manner and then issue the next call.
- we need access to raw logs of a transaction, but the few tests that use this feature might also be changed
- tests do not rely on finalized blocks, so mining might not be necessary. If it is, we have to get around the one second delay.
- we have to add a jsonrpc client to soltest
