Hey @winsvega!

Please could you add comments on these lines, saying that these are indirect dependencies required by leveldb? So we don't lose track of that.

Even better, you could have a look at the CMake support for switching between leveldb and rocksdb, and put them inside "if leveldb" conditionals.

I think these belong into UseEth.cmake
