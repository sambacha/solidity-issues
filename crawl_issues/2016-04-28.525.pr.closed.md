# [\#525 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/525) `closed`: WORK IN PROGRESS - Solidity standalone

DO NOT COMMIT.

This is work-in-progress on making the solidity repo completely standalone.    All the main executables build, but further cleanup is required.   Also need to work on the tests.

The approach was to orphan copies of the entire `webthree-helpers/cmake` and `libweb3core/libdevcore` folders into this repo, fix up the relative paths to get it working, and them to trim away at it from there and see how minimal we could get it.

This is fine for testing, but I think we should go the other way round:
Solidity does not make use of much inside libdevcore, it mainly uses sha3, FixedHash, bytesref and some convenience formatting and vector functions. We should copy sha3, create a slimmed-down version of fixedhash and either get rid of bytesref or try to also copy over a slimmed-down version of it.

I think if we start copying large amounts of code, maintainability will actually rather decrease than increase (even if we "promise" to only copy temporarily).

Yeah - I'm just exploring my way to an answer on what our actual dependencies are, by chopping the CMake and libdevcore files down to the bare minimum, and then seeing what we have left.

See, for example ...

I have plenty more chopping to do yet here!
