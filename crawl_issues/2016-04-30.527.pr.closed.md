Do not merge yet - I would like to get feedback before finishing this work. Also some commits should be squashed later.

First two commits could be merged as those are only trivial fixes.

Regarding this rest:
- SHL seems solid
- SAR/SHR needs further testing (and not failing tests) and validation
- the tests need to be extended and perhaps it shouldn't be in the end-to-end test

(Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/33.)

Nice! Some comments:
- shifts are bit operations, they assume some representation of numbers in binary and thus it should not be possible to use them on integers
- signextend should be used as part of the "higher order bits cleanup" before the operation, i.e. appendShiftOperatorCode should not take a type argument.

> shifts are bit operations, they assume some representation of numbers in binary and thus it should not be possible to use them on integers

You mean signed integers?

My understanding is the following: all shift operations should work on the internal representation of numbers, which is two's complement for `int`.

The different shifts:
1) SHL (shift left, <<) - Shouldn't care if the input is int/uint
2) SHR (shift right, >>>) - Shouldn't care if the input is int/uint,  `0` is added on the left
3) SAR (shift arithmetic right, >>) - Should care about sign, `1` is added on the left if it is signed (i.e. highest bit was 1, depends on the width of `intXX`)

The above is taken from Javascript and is what the Solidity parser had.  I am not fully convinced we need SAR - if omit it, I would suggest to have >> for SHR.

I would hold off on this until after the fixed point and rationals are implemented....there are some major changes that kind of dork what you're trying to do in your set up :)

@axic no I mean integers in themselves. There is no such thing as "shifting an integer", it is just a number, you should not have to assume that it is in two's complement. At the point where you explicitly convert the integer into a `bytesNN`, it assumes two's complement representation, the notions of "left" and "right" get a meaning and it makes sense to "shift" in those directions.

Having said that: I realize how used people are to applying shift operators to integers...

So if we add shift operators, I would prefer to drop `>>>` and use `x >> y` to be identical to `x / 2**y`.

One advantage of that is that we can say that "shifting an integer" means multiplying / dividing by appropriate powers of two and thus get rid of the number representation issue.

Concerning the break with javascript: Solidity is typed, so the distinction between `>>` and  `>>>` is not really needed.

@chriseth It is more clear now. Coming from a C background, I only have a notion of "integers" which behave like "bytesNN".

Do I understand it right that you want a left and right shift operator, denoted by << (SHL) and >> (SHR) respectively and that it behaves according to the type information. For signed integers the right shift would behave like an arithmetic right shift (= `x / 2**y`).

Is this correct?

I think @VoR0220 added support for shift operations on constants as a PR to my branch. I'll merge that soon.

Following up with the previous question. Do we agree with the following?
- Have logical shifts only: `<<` (SHL) and `>>` (SHR) 
- Remove the `SHR` define
- Remove the `>>>` token

If yes, I'll push an update later today.

As per our discussion, for the moment the following assumptions are made:
- `>>>` token is kept, but an exception is thrown in Types/ExpressionCompiler
- `SHL`, `SHR`, `SAR` defines are unchanged, but internally we'll only use `SHL` and `SAR` which denote `<<` and `>>` respectively.
- shifting with negative right value is prohibited (throws an error)

I think it would be good to perform cleanup before every shift operation. The cleanup for the left operand is not necessary for left shifts, but I think it is fine to do it still.

The check that the right operand is not negative has to be done in asm. Even if the right operand has a signed type, it can still be positive.

Finally, I think we should ensure that the second operand has to be an integer (i.e. not a bytesN) - please add a test for that, not sure if we already do.

I think it is good to promote the `appendShiftOperatorCode` function out of `appendOrdinaryBinaryOperatorCode` and call it at the same point where that is called because it requires some type information, at least for the second operand.

Also, how to test with signed ints? There doesn't seem to be an `i256()`. Only `fromHex()` is the way?

Removed the catch-all and I get this:

@chriseth:

Do we check that in every single case or only if it a signed type?

I've added a piece of code to `appendShiftOperatorCode`, which invokes the errorTag.

@axic signed integers: just use `u256(-1)`.
The test for negativeness has of course only be done for signed types.

By the way, vitalik came up with an interesting hack for shifting - we might want to check whether it is faster. It might have a negative impact on static analysis, though and does not work for signed shift:

`x >> y` can be implemented as

```
mstore(0, 0)
mstore(32, x)
mload(sub(32, y))
```

Nice! It works in the context of Solidity, because the memory expansion cost was already paid for that area :)

It can also be applied to unsigned left shifts:

```
mstore(0, x)
mstore(32, 0)
mload(y)
```

The left shift takes 9 gas, the right shift takes 12, while `EXP` alone has a base fee of 10 and could become quite pricey after the next HF(s).

Cons:
- makes static analysis hard
- makes optimisations in JITs hard (i.e. evmjit)
- not sure about how to practically apply this (it only works if shifting by a multiple of 8)

Regarding the last point, we need:
a) to have an rvalue as a const so we can make the decision compile time
b) to add runtime check for the same

This actually makes me think `MSTORE` and `MLOAD` are underpriced (in the case the area doesn't need to be extended) as they cost the same arithmetic instructions (add, sub, etc. - not taking exp under the same umbrella).

Concerning the tests: It is probably not too important to have many regular shift tests because we assume that the VM is correct. What we could add in addition is higher order bits cleanup tests like

```
uint16 x = 0xffff;
x += 0x20;
x <<= 8;
x >>= 16;
```

The test output should report the line number of the failure, so this should be sufficient unless you use loops.

@promethe42 you can implement bitshifts very easily using exponential:
