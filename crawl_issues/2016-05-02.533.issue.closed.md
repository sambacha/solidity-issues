# [\#533 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/533) `closed`: `uint` variables shouldn't allow negative prefix

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-05-02 18:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/533):

1) This compiles without error:

```
uint a;
a = a * -a;
```

or

```
uint a;
a = 1 * -a;
```

2) This properly throws an error:

```
uint a;
a = a * -1;
```

The error is:

```
Untitled1:24:13: Error: Operator * not compatible with types uint256 and int_const -1
        a = a * -1;
            ^----^
```

A more complex example for 1): 

```
function wrong(uint a) returns (uint) {
        return 1 * -a;
    }
```

When passing `1` as an input, this will return `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`, which is -1 in two's complement (`int`).

@chriseth I think he raises a good point here. We should disallow negative unary operations on a uint.

Sorry, but I don't really see the problem :-)
Forget about two's complement, this is just how it is represented internally, but the math should work out even without having to think about two's complement. Here is how it works:

Operations on variables of `uint` are performed in the ring mod `2**256`. Furthermore, if `x` and `y` are `uint` variables, then certainly something like `x-y` should be possible (and is just computed mod `2**256`). Since `-a` is just a short hand for `0-a`, I don't see why it should be disallowed. Since `0` is equivalent to `2**256`, is is just natural that `-1` is the same as `2**256-1`, which is `0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`.

then I suppose we should call this closed.

Folloing the protocol, @axic should close this.

okay
