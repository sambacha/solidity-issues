# [\#539 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/539) `closed`: Solidity needs the ability to test its code within itself

For too long we dapp developers have had to go through the strain of utilizing web3 for all of our solidity needs and it stops this language from reaching its full potential...by making dapp creation and testing unnecessarily arduous. A neat article about it was recently written about it here: https://medium.com/@karl_dot_tech/soliditys-biggest-bug-javascript-be5c4f3520a5#.ggs5w8okq

This thread is to begin the discussion for how we might go about with internal testing of code. My proposition is simple:

we establish a `--call` flag within the compiler. For the beginning purposes, it will take in a string, that string being what function the user wants to call with the necessary arguments intact. Since we are using it for testing purposes, we will then ask that users put in an event template for what they would like to log out for their usage. A simple hello world contract tutorial would look something like this:

```
//stored as helloworld.sol
contract HelloWorld {
    event log(string); 
    function main() {
        log("Hello, World!");
     }
}
```

called as: 
`solc helloworld.sol --call main()`

I don't think this will be an insurmountable task, most of the work is already done for us in the execution framework created for the boost unit tests suite. All we will have to do is morph it into a more automated environment for general development. 

Granted...it will not be able to reliably replicate all factors. This is a completely different environment than what most programming languages are operating in. Everything in the environment is always in flux and for the best testing, they should use Mix. But for beginners, I think this will more than do the trick for whatever it is they would like to execute. We can even create a little false block for them to start on that has a large amount of ether to execute with, as well as create and instantiate "false addresses" for the case of sending of Wei. 

Let's discuss this.

closing as Remix is handling this.
