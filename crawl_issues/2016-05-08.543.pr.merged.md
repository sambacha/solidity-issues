I looked here for this information and didn't initially find it. Hoping to help out others who think the same way as me and look here.

Could you please rather add a link to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html?highlight=address#members-of-addresses (using internal linking of course)? There are a lot of other members that are missing in your list and I think it would be better to just refer to the place where they are all explained.

How's that? (not familiar with .rst files so I appreciate your support if I didn't get it right)
