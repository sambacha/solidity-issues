I was wondering if this could make it more confusing or not. Would it make sense prefixing those external method names so that it becomes easily visible it is an external method?

Also what happens in the case a function has the same name as an assembly instruction?

```
    function origin() private {
        assembly {
            origin()
        }
    }
```

@axic assembly instructions of course take precendence. You can resolve the ambiguity by making an assignment to a solidity variable. Also, you cannot "call" the external functions in inline assembly, they behave more like jump labels.

@chriseth so is this PR only adding support for jumping to the referenced method? That makes much more sense than allowing it to be a `CALL`.

Correct that typo and it's good to merge.
