fixes #553 . Fixed all issues. I have made this so that you can link from a single file in the compiler arguments, or multiple as has been the traditional approach. I think this is a much more dynamic import scheme and should be merged immediately.

There are reasons why this should not be allowed in some cases, let's talk about this at some point.
In general, I don't think it is a good idea to use `import "../something"`, let's try to stick to how imports work in nodejs / npm.
