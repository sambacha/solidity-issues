# [\#559 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/559) `closed`: Emscripten builds are not minimized anymore (solc-bin)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-05-12 00:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/559):

In [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin) starting from soljson-v0.3.2-2016-05-03-aa4dcbb.js the output is not minimized. This means the file size is ~34Mb as opposed to ~7Mb.

Side note: maybe it would make sense enabling _issues_ in the solc-bin repo to file reports like this there.

Fixed now.
