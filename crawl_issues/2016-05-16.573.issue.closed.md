Relates to #571 #490 #570 #502 #486 ....I currently cannot compile anything with OS X....this leads me to believe something is wrong with the OS X slave because it should be picking up these problems in the jenkins runs. Either way...we need a fix and stat.

It is entirely plausible that OS X tests aren't being run consistently within Jenkins.

I've been working on CircleCI, TravisCI and Appveyor alternatives which we can have running in parallel as soon as we do the repository reorgs.    I will try to get test runs working on those ASAP.

okay....so from my findings

cmake set to debug = works
set to relwithdebuginfo = fails all compilation
set to release = fails all compilation

Confirmed that building with `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` makes the issue go away.  HeisenBug confirmed.  

Has anyone tried using LLVM 3.7 to confirm that this isn't an LLVM 3.8 related issue?

I tried to reproduce this problem on our el capitan build machine but could not. I tried the following combinations:

( Release / RelWithDebugInfo ) x ( build with XCode / build with make )

In all configurations, I used cmake with `-DTESTS=0 -DGUI=0 -DETHASHCL=0 -DEVMJIT=0`.

Furthermore, the `--version` string shows `Interpreter` at the end (not JIT). But I think this does not have any influence as we have seen this being reported with `Interpreter` builds, too.

Could anyone please check whether this is a ElCapitan/Yosemite issue?

Can confirm... -DEVMJIT=0 -DETHASHCL=0 when run with all versions will enable it to build and run properly. This is going to be like finding a needle in a haystack...

You can use the following command in the root of the /webthree-umbrella directory where you checked out the code:

./webthree-helpers/scripts/ethbuild.sh --no-git --project solidity --all --cores 4 -DEVMJIT=0 -DTESTS=0 -DGUI=0 -DETHASHCL=0

@kjsujesh @VoR0220 
mm..  I'm still getting the error solc: signal: segmentation fault

What did I do:
I went ethereum.org/cli because I am a Noob and I want to develop using OSX as OS.
1. brew tap ethereum/ethereum
2. brew install ethereum

No I want the solc compiler. According to  ethereum.org/cli:
3. brew tap ethereum/ethereum
4. brew install cpp-ethereum
5. brew linkapps cpp-ethereum

Then I cloned, because I don't have a clue where webthree is (told you I was a Noob):
6. git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella

then I went into the "just cloned" webthree-umbrella directory and executed the command:
7. ./webthree-helpers/scripts/ethbuild.sh --no-git --project solidity --all --cores 4 -DEVMJIT=0 -DTESTS=0 -DGUI=0 -DETHASHCL=0

Then I excuted the geth command:
8. geth  --rpc --rpccorsdomain "*" --testnet console

In the Geth console:
9. admin.setSolc("/usr/local/bin/solc")

Still the error.

Please have a look at this : http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html

After you build, use the solidity tests to check for errors. They are here:

in your admin.setSolc("/usr/local/bin/solc") step, can you try changing to the solc that you just built?
Like 
admin.setSolc("<path to your build folder here>/webthree-umbrella/solidity/build/solc/solc")
and then try ?

I thought that a possibility was that Geth was causing the issue.. So I followed the instructions (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Installation-Instructions-for-Mac) to clone and build Geth, but unfortunately the error still is here. 

What I do find odd is this:
When selecting the solc within Geth using Console, OR as parameter does not seem to fill the [].
So when saying eth.getCompilers() returns []  That's strange isnt it?  The same command in Windows  returns "Solidity"

@VoR0220 @kjsujesh 

I decided to remove the solc file in /usr/local/bin/solc and cp'd the build file in webthree, but that didnt help. 
Something funny happened: I tried to run ./webthree-helpers/scripts/ethbuild.sh --no-git --project solidity --all --cores 4 -DEVMJIT=0 -DTESTS=0 -DGUI=0 -DETHASHCL=0.
On the end something didnt go right.  Anyone?

Maybe hitting this, @boestin?
https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/518
If so, should be fixed now, by @chfast.

Need to do `brew install cpp-ethereum --build-from-source` right now if you are on El Capitan because of a broken bottle on just that version.    Because of incomplete Jenkins work in https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/454.

Sorry!

@bobsummerwill No worries.  I thought it was me again ^^
It's running now.  Then after I'll test if the segmentation error still exists.

@chfast so for buggy solc with command:

`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DEVMJIT=1 -DETHASHCL=1 ..` :

```

for

for non buggy solc:

@boestin in the meantime try this

```
./webthree-helpers/scripts/ethbuild.sh --no-git --project solidity --all --cores 4 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

@VoR0220 Ok, i'll try.  So to make it clear for me. The solc that is sitting in /usr/local/bin/solc remains untouched. Right?  When I start geth, it will automatically points to that direction for some reason. 

When ethbuild is finished, do I need to make another action to "copy" the build solc to /usr/local/bin/solc

Thanks.

I have not... @chfast should I start looking for dependencies elsewhere in the dylibs that solc calls from? I think we might find more information there.

@VoR0220 YES it's working!
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug is a workaround for me!

it would appear that a fix to the way it was before is just about here. #584 when this PR is merged, you should be able to at the very least compile and grab the ABI and binaries from your contracts. There is still a remaining problem of seg faults with the gas estimator...I suppose that this is coming from a different area. But the main parts that you will care about for web3 deployment should be working. Let us know if the problem persists so that we can wrap up this issue.

if you really need the gas parameter or ast, set your cmake to the debug build.

Closed as dupe of "The Heisenbug" - https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/565.   We can reopen if we later find there is anything unique here.
