# [\#589 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/589) `closed`: Support calling library functions on literals

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17865?v=4" width="50">[Arachnid](https://github.com/Arachnid) opened issue at [2016-05-21 16:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/589):

With the introduction of support for 'internal' library functions, libraries now have a bunch of new uses, including adding new functionality to existing types like `string`. However, while doing `using foo for string` will allow you to call functions defined in `foo` on `string` instances, `"foo".foo()` still fails with an error.

It'd be really good if Solidity could treat literals the same way as variables of the same type, and allow calling library methods on them.

That might be difficult to pull off given the current architecture.

In the latest build this mysteriously already works for string literals!

Close this then?
