There's not too many IDEs left to "do", eh?

I started a thread with JetBrains asking about whether all their IDEs had a common plugin infrastructure.   They do.    So somebody could write a Solidity plugin which would then work for IDEA IntelliJ, CLION, AppCode and Android Studio.

Anybody working on Solidity for Notepad? :-)
