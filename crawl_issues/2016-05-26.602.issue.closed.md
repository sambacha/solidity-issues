Accessor functions should reject ether sent to them.

Thanks for this. It's a much needed change. For now the only way around this is to do something like this: https://github.com/slockit/DAO/pull/185/files#diff-00f5402e5918b82e1560a8173c0aa689R99

Would it be better to just allow modifiers for variables?

Modifiers can only be added to functions, but we could add them in the same way to a state variable which means it will be applied to its accessor function. A modifier that would solve exactly this issue is the one named after Emmy Noether:

```
modifier noether { if (msg.value > 0) throw; _ }
```

Example of usage:

```
contract c {
  uint public noether x;
}
```

seems reasonable only if they are state variables. Particularly when thought of in the context of public getters.
