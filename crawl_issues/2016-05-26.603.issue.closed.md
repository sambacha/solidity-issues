# [\#603 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/603) `closed`: Broken escape code handling in ASTJsonConverter

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-05-26 16:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/603):

We have a problem with escape codes in strings and the resulting compiler JSON output.

Any escape code used in a string literal, such as

```
string memory x = "Hello World\x12";
```

will be present in the output in the form of:

```
{"attributes":{"string":"null","type":"literal_string \"Hello World\u0012\"","value":"Hello World\u0012"},"name":"Literal"}
```

For JSON encoding, Solidity uses jsoncpp. [json.org](https://json.org) and [ECMA-404](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf) state that every string is _Unicode_ (doesn't state whether UTF-8, UTF-16, etc, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) clarifies that a bit) and also offers escaping (for every unicode codepoint in the form of `\uXXXX`).

Take the example 

```
string memory x = "Hello World\x80";
```

The 0x80 will be present in the output jSON as is. No escaping, nothing.

Based on my understanding of UTF-8, `>= 0x80` is not encoded as a single byte.  Whether Solidity or jsoncpp is at fault, I'm not sure. 

But the encoding is wrong and it confuses [Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/07b87426f898d6e9c677db291d9088c839197291/src/preamble.js#L518), resulting in an invalid, unparseable JSON for Javascript.
