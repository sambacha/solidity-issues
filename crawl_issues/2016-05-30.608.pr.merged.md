so will this be talking to a geth testnet? How will we ensure that this has enough gas to run?

furthermore...what happens if geth is not adapted in ABI terms?

This will talk to `eth --test` - which has additional features that are required here like rewinding the chain and especially mining blocks without proof of work and manipulating the timestamp.

The goal is to remove the link-requirement to libethereum for running the unit tests.

Does this work for Windows?   We'll need to Appveyor it up.

it looks like we're not using Boost ASIO anywhere in our codebase.    Is that intentional? (because all networking has been going through devp2p or similar).

Just wondering if there is some architectural policy/decision here, thanks!

This does not work for windows, we need to re-implement the IPCSocket class based on windows pipes, but that should not be a big deal.

Yep.

See https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/622 and https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/623 which are tracking this TODO.
