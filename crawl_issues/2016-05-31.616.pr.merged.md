I have some comments on these changes.

I agree they are better in that they generally remind people that `send`s can fail. That's helpful.

I also really like moving things over to a queue that users can access to trigger withdrawal. That makes a lot of sense to me as a nice pattern.

I do think that `throw` on failed `send` as a general rule is very problematic, arguably more so than just not checking. It is not because any of these code samples seem to have logic problems, but because it can be very difficult to reason about what's happened and why leading up to a throw, and assessing correctness becomes difficult.

In database terms, a throw is a rollback of a transaction, (although it eats the gas). Rolling back is often appropriate, but in general I'm not seeing the logical question of 'should we rollback' addressed separately from 'did this send fail?' 

I would call that a bad code smell, and especially a concerning one in sample docs -- I think we shouldn't be encouraging devs to conflate those questions by example.

At any rate, I put this here mostly to engender a conversation, so please engage with your thoughts.

In that case, would it be more appropriate to return the value of the `send` and let whoever is doing the withdrawal handle it?

@vessenes if you say that this PR gives some value, then I would propose it to be merged. It might be possible to further improve the examples. Please create a followup-PR for that, though.

@chriseth I think this is a huge step forward in the docs, I don't mean to come across too negative. I think I'm just daunted at the size of the problem.
