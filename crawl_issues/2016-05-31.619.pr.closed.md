# [\#619 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/619) `closed`: Fixed Point Type

Edit: Some progress on this (w00t I'm back for a little)

I am going to split this into a couple of key parts, this will contain the list of things, and once those are all done, I shall close them. 
- [x] testing framework for fixed point types (fixed helper function for encoding)
- [x] testing framework signature
- [x] Binary operations
- [x] Boolean operations
- [x] Unary operations
- [x] Basic arithmetic (modulo, addition, subtraction, division)
- [ ] Harder to do in fixed point arithmetic (multiplication [needs inline assembly conversion], exponentiation) 
- [ ] Number class in type checking section to better handle implicit conversion (this can be postponed until a later date unless someone wants to work on it) 
- [x] Testing implicit conversion and explicit conversion in the bytecode

@chriseth @VoR0220 would it make sense splitting this PR into multiple parts?
- 1) assignment and return values
- 2) conversion (between different fixed types and `uint`)
- 3) comparison
- 4) arithmetics (maybe you want to split them into smaller bits, like each operation is separate)

Not sure that makes much sense...all of that is pretty much done. Most of this works, only thing that is missing is converting the arithmetic portion (and when I say arithmetic portion, I mean the multiplication portion) to inline assembly...once that's done...the rest of this is easy pickings.

with that said, there is one issue that needs to be worked on in terms of type checking and that's to create a larger Number class that will encompass rationals, integers, and fixed point types. This should in theory enable type checking that allows us to better handle the one typechecking exception that we currently have which can be seen at the bottom of #409

It makes total sense splitting this up. I think it is reasonable to prepare a PR for review that has everything except for mulitplication.

Fair, then I shall begin the splitting.

Beginning my split, will close this when I am done so we can approach this in a modular way. It is true, I tried to take this behemoth on all at once, but breaking it into parts would be much better at this point I agree. Keep this here until I delete it please. You will have a flurry of PRs at your disposal, this will now become a checklist of different parts implemented (will edit top)

@VoR0220 can we close this on favour of the split out PRs or you would prefer to keep this open for a while?

yea we can close this.

Where exactly did this go to? Is it still planned for completion?

Not in the near future because it's at a dangling stage.
