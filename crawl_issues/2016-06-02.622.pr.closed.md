# [\#622 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/622) `closed`: add a way to read from stdin in combination with other input_files args

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/649160?v=4" width="50">[rubensayshi](https://github.com/rubensayshi) opened issue at [2016-06-02 01:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/622):

until now it was only possible to either use stdin or a list of paths, with `-` you can combine the 2.  

when you specify `-`:
- it will add `cwd` to allowed directories (so you can import from `cwd`)
- you can add other arguments and still be reading from stdin too, eg; `myimports/=~/mysolimportsdir`

```
echo '
contract mul2 {
    function double(uint v) returns (uint) {
        return v * 2;
    }
}
' > mul2.sol;

echo '
import "mul2.sol";

contract testme {
    function main() returns (uint) {
        mul2 x = new mul2();
        return x.double(5);
    }
}
' > testme.sol

# ./solidity/build/solc/solc --abi < testme.sol # doesn't work: Source "mul2.sol" not found: File outside of allowed directories.
./solidity/build/solc/solc --abi - < testme.sol # does work

rm mul2.sol
rm testme.sol
```

Hm, usually you use `-` to mean `stdin`, would that also work?

I'm not too familiar with the boost arg parsing stuff, adding `allow_long_disguise` as style will allow all long options to be used as short options too.  
I couldn't find a way to specify this for a single option...

see; http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_39_0/doc/html/boost/program_options/command_line_style/style_t.html

A quick test revealed that `-` will just end up in `m_args["input-file"]`. So please add a check whether the file name is `-` and if yes, read from stdin. You can even combine that with the part that checks if there is no input file at all.

ah, sorry I misunderstood, I thought you meant you wanted `-stdin`!

updated to support `-` as input file

updated to fix the excidental code style changes!

Looks good, but please rebase, it cannot be merged like this.

not entirely sure what happened (debugging atm) but it seems to conflict somehow with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/652/files

so don't merge ;)

@chriseth rebased and redid it (again), figured I had to filter out the `-` from the input files ...

it might be nice to have tests for the `CommandLineInterface`... but that would require decoupling it from `cin` / `cerr` / `cout` by passing those into the constructor as `std::istream&` I guess (I'm just getting started with cpp)? shall I?

shall I do that as a seperate PR and you can merge that before this one so I can add tests to this one after that is merged?

updated so that when you `-` it will add `cwd` to allowed dirs, because if you'd do `=`pwd`` combined with `--add-std` it would otherwise break.
