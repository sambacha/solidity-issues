# [\#624 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/624) `merged`: Inaccessible dynamic types

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-06-02 10:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/624):

Dynamic types returned function calls are not available inside Solidity due to a limitation of the EVM. Previously, such components in the return type were discarded. This fix replaces them with an "unusable" type so that the order of components is not destroyed.

This "fix" is going to cause serious problems in the real world and should immediately be reversed.
