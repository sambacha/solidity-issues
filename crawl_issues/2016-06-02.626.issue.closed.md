# [\#626 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/626) `closed`: Throw error if import not used?

Currently, the compiler will still compile a file where an import is declared, but the contents of said import are nowhere used in the file. Might we consider throwing an error if they are not used?

Maybe not an error but a warning?

No, because you might want to import symbols just for the purpose of exporting them again.

Well why wouldn't you just import the symbols in the needed contract then?

You can create a "package" that exports a selection of symbols from other files. Closing this now, we can discuss further on gitter.
