Cleaned up the Ubuntu section by providing the very minimal requirements needed to compile `solc` only, on Ubuntu 16.04, with and without using the PPA.
Rewritten up-to-date ones for 14.04 LTS.
Removed those for the other (obsolete) Ubuntu releases.

In the old instructions, these lines were present:

```
sudo apt-get -y install language-pack-en-base
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
sudo apt-get -y install software-properties-common
```

I didn't reinclude them, but I cannot figure out why they were necessary in the first place, since solidity seems to compile just fine.
Can anyone shed some light?

Thanks a lot!
