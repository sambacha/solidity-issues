Removing "public" from the variable "data" allow the program to be compiled. But I would prefer a clear error message than an internal error.

@bortzmeyer the error message is there also:
`[dev::tag_comment*] = Accessors for mapping with dynamically-sized keys not yet implemented.`

Duplicate of #498.

@axic I guess @bortzmeyer meant that it was not immediately obvious from the error message that removing `public` would work. A more friendly message would probably be very helpful here.

Actually it would be nice to raise this issue in the type checker so a proper error message can be displayed as opposed to an assertion.
