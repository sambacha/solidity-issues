got any ideas for how to put some tests together for this?

I like that this allows for multiple versions of libraries to work side-by-side. That seems essential for a higher level package management system to sit on top of. I wonder if doing this at the import level is the best place though. It would be _very_ confusing if a user used two identical import statements and one of them works as expected and the other errors out. I suppose that the package manager/module loader is expected to prevent that from happening? There must be a similar problem that was solved in npm to allow different library versions to be used in the same project. A little different perhaps since Javascript does not require linking them all together with single compile command.

@raineorshine I am not really sure if the situation you describe would be confusing or not. Assume you have a package whose package description tells the packager that it wants to use the `strings` library as of version 1.0.5. Then another package wants to use `strings` as of version 1.6.2. Both use `import "strings";` and they end up importing different files. On the contrary: Wouldn't it be confusing if a remapping configuration for one package would be able to modify the remappings for another one?

I just changed this commit so that the remappings are a feature of the compiler. This allows better post-compilation verification and does not require a change to the js interface at the same time.
A future change will replace the two options we currently have (optimizer and number of runs) by a much more detailed options json object which will also include the remappings.

@VoR0220 moving them into the compiler stack also allows us to test them more easily :-)

@chriseth That makes sense. I guess I just get scared when I hear "context dependent"... I generally work in environments where referential transparency is a good thing. So this is just different than what I am used to.
