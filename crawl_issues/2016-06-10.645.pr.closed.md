I'm not so certain here...It seems this is adding to the cost of deployment of a contract.

Thanks for the comments, @zelig!

One specific problem where I would like to have comments on: It should of course be possible to verify the metadata by different builds of the same compiler version (i.e. for different architectures). But this means that neither the binary hash nor the compiler version in its current form should be part of it (because that is reproduced in a different way depending on the architecture), and instead just the git commit hash. This means that the actual compiler binary can only be retrieved after a lookup inside the "compiler contract". This lookup is recommended anyway so that you do not download anything that is not even a compiler, as explained in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/611, so I would not think this is a drawback.

@VoR0220 The additional costs are less than 2500 gas for the data and there is the option to switch it off. One of the advantages is that everyone will automatically have an auto-generated user interface for a contract in mist.

If there are no further comments, I would like to implement it like that. As there are a lot of flexibilities anyway, I don't think it is a big deal if we screw up the first version.

Note: There is more flexibility in the input specification for the solidity compiler. It should be possible to change the "mode" the compiler is operating on, for example:
- only parse and type check, but do not compile
- list all contracts in all files and whether they are abstract or not (could be done by just doing everything apart from compiling)
- in general, do not compile unless bytecode is requested

@chriseth updated the regular output. I think the input `settings.outputSelection` should be an array of strings and each element should match the output field names.

@chriseth is why3 going to be generated per-file basis or only a single output is given? (I would assume the latter.)

@axic `compilationTarget` and `outputSelection` should somehow be unified. Do you think this can be done?

Why3 is currently on compiler-invocation basis, so neither contract nor file specific, and I think it will stay like that in the future.

@chriseth:

> Why3 is currently on compiler-invocation basis, so neither contract nor file specific, and I think it will stay like that in the future.

I mean the output generated is a single blob for every included source or there's one output blob for each input?

@axic there is one output blob (just that it is not binary). Everything gets combined into a single file.

I will just provide a copy of the current state of the pad to increase redundancy:

```
**************************************************
Standardized Input Description and Metadata Output
**************************************************

In order to ease source code verification of complex contracts that are spread across several files,
there is a standardized way for describing the relations between those files.
Furthermore, the compiler can generate a json file while compiling that includes
the (hash of the) source, natspec comments and other metadata whose hash is included in the
actual bytecode. Specifically, the creation data for a contract has to begin with
`push32 <metadata hash> pop`.

The metadata standard is versioned. Future versions are only required to provide the "version" field,
the "language" field and the two keys inside the "compiler" field.
The field compiler.keccak should be the keccak hash of a binary of the compiler with the given version.

The example below is presented in a human-readable way. Properly formatted metadata
should use quotes correctly, reduce whitespace to a minimum and sort the keys of all objects
to arrive at a unique formatting.

Comments are of course not permitted and used here only for explanatory purposes.

Input Description
-----------------

QUESTION: How to specific file-reading callback? - probably not as part of json input

The input description is language-specific and could change with each compiler version, but it
should be backwards compatible if possible.

    {
      sources:
      {
        // the keys here are the "global" names of the source files, imports can use other files via remappings (see below)
        "abc": "contract b{}", // specify source directly
        // I think 'keccak' on its on is not enough. I would go perhaps with swarm: "0x12.." and ipfs: "Qma..." for simplicity
        // Where the content is stored is a second component, but yes, we could give an indication there.
        "def": {keccak: "0x123..."}, // source has to be retrieved by its hash
        "ghi": {file: "/tmp/path/to/file.sol"}, // file on filesystem
        "dir/file.sol": "contract a {}"
      },

        // addresses of the libraries. If not all libraries are given here, it can result in unlinked objects whose output data is different

        "source1.sol": {
          "AST": { ... }
        }
      }
    }

Metadata Output
---------------

Note that the actual bytecode is not part of the metadata because the hash
of the metadata structure will be included in the bytecode itself.

This requires the compiler to be able to compute the hash of its own binary,
which requires it to be statically linked. The hash of the binary is not
too important. It is much more important to have the commit hash because
that can be used to query a location of the binary (and whether the version is
"official") at a registry contract. 

    {
      version: "1",
      language: "Solidity",
      compiler: {
        commit: "55db20e32c97098d13230ab7500758e8e3b31d64",
        version: "soljson-2313-2016-12-12",
        keccak: "0x123..."
      },
      sources:
      {
        "abc": {keccak: "0x456..."}, // here, sources are always given by hash
        "def": {keccak: "0x123..."},
        "dir/file.sol": {keccax: "0xabc..."}
      },
      settings:
      {
        remappings: [":g/dir"],
        optimizer: {enabled: true, runs: 500},
        compilationTarget: "myFile.sol:MyContract",
        libraries: {
          "def:MyLib": "0x123123..."
        }
      },
      output:
      {
        abi: [ /* abi definition */ ],
        natspec: [ /* user documentation comments */ ]
      }
    }

This is used in the following way: A component that wants to interact
with a contract (e.g. mist) retrieves the creation transaction of the contract
and from that the first 33 bytes. If the first byte decodes into a PUSH32
instruction, the other 32 bytes are interpreted as the keccak-hash of
a file which is retrieved via a content-addressable storage like swarm.
That file is JSON-decoded into a structure like above. Sources are
retrieved in the same way and combined with the structure into a proper
compiler input description, which selects only the bytecode as output.

The compiler of the correct version (which is checked to be part of the "official" compilers)
is invoked on that input. The resulting
bytecode is compared (excess bytecode in the creation transaction
is constructor input data) which automatically verifies the metadata since
its hash is part of the bytecode. The constructor input data is decoded
according to the interface and presented to the user.

suggestion by @axic: extend metadata information with a retrieve-hint. So we can always use keccak for referencing source files and also add a swarm, ipfs or github link to actually get the source.

same goes for the actual metadata "file" - we should include the keccak hash plus a way to retrieve the file.

I would like to propose that we add in the keys of `chainID` (or something like the concept of a chain ID) and block deployed at for verifiability and better package management.

"block deployed at" cannot be part of the metadata, because that has to be compile-time constant. The current plan is to fire a log at construction time, but the clients do not index events as well as they could be, so that might be hard to find. Perhaps we should put the "block deployed at" in the deployed bytecode in addition to firing an event.
