# [\#650 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/650) `closed`: Throw instead of STOP on failed CALL

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6198746?v=4" width="50">[lastperson](https://github.com/lastperson) opened issue at [2016-06-14 14:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/650):

Hello. According to https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity-Features#detect-failed-calls

```
If a CALL fails, do not just silently continue.
Currently, this issues a STOP but it will throw an exception once we have exceptions.
```

We have exceptions, it's time to throw!

This was a deliberate design decision because `call` is low-level feature and thus it allows you to make a fine-grained choice about whether you want to propagate exceptions or not. This is also the only way to actually catch an exception currently.

@chriseth I've been suspecting such an answer :). Will update the wiki.

Sorry but I think you misinterpreted that entry in the features list. It was not about the `.call()` function but about the EVM opcode `CALL`. Please revert the change.

Note that the features list is not at all meant as documentation, but rather some kind of changelog for people who are on the cutting edge.

@chriseth ok, changes reverted. But then, current (reverted) example is incorrect, because the code snippet and described behavior is not matching.

The behaviour of the code snippet matches the state of the compiler at the time of writing. As I said, the features list is not meant as documentation.
