Looks good at first glance. Thanks! Please correct compiler error and add tests.

@chriseth @graup seems like I've pushed the wrong version of the branch.

As already discussed in other threads: I think we should retain the ability to add raw hex codes using `\xff` and only add utf8-encoded codes by `\u00ff`. The PR as it is now would also break backwards compatibilty.

This works now properly I believe.

(The Linux tests fails due to emscripten - part the ongoing Solidity standalone changes.)

@chriseth added docs and rebased, but there's still a travis issue going on.

It seems `eth` was not installed on travis somehow. Merging because tests on macos are green.
