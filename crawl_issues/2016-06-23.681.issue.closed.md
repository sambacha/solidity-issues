It would be nice if the documentation would explain the parameters and maybe give an example on how you would use this function.

For now, take a look at [this](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethsign). Hopefully it'll tide you over until I can properly document this.

@VoR0220, do you think this should be explicitly stated in these docs or is a quick link to the web3 docs sufficient?

It does not hurt to mention it explicitly.

Also either mention or fix the "invalid input" bug for ecrecover.

@chriseth, what is this "invalid input" bug?

Perhaps including (a link to) https://gist.github.com/axic/5b33912c6f61ae6fd96d6c4a47afde6d could be useful.

I wish the code @axic posted was part of the standard library. Without it ecrecover is pretty useless to the normal developer.

There is a wrong answer when I use ecrecover,the address always be different.but when I use personal_ecRecover,it's right. Is there something different between those two method? I  have try those method upstair,web3.eth.sign has the same result with personal.sign.but can't pass solidity ecrecover method too.

Hello, apologies if this is not the correct place to comment on this (and please direct me elsewhere if necessary), but I am having the same issue - following all the examples, including the one linked to from here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2151 , I am unable to get ecrecover to work as documented (i.e. it does not return the signing address). I have posted a more detailed question here https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15364/totally-baffled-by-ecrecover with details of what I am doing. Can anyone explain what may be wrong? 
Thanks!

I'm not sure how much detail we would like to mention here. We should mention that a return value of zero means "invalid input" and that the ecrecover builtin still has the "high s" issue, i.e. you can take an existing signature and modify both v and s (IIRC) in a certain way, to get a different but equally valid signature.

@chriseth I'm also not very sure of the level of detail here. I can find a lot of questions, but I'm also not sure how many still apply. e.g.

https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15364/ecrecover-from-geth-and-web3-eth-sign

Also because we bump into the issue of Solidity being part of a toolchain again, most of the examples to show how to use `ecrecover` properly use something else alongside, I can do that if you think it's a good idea?

@gumb0 had no recollection of the "high s" issue still existing, and neither of us can find any reference to it either.

"high s" still not documented.

@chriseth My comment from the last time we spoke about this remains. There are no search results for "high s", and no one else I spoke to at EF knew what was meant by it. So I am happy to document, but need a little guidance.

Openzeppelin are about to fix it in the helper library: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1622

We should say something along the lines of "if you use the low-level ecrecover function, be aware that a valid signature can be turned into a different valid signature without requiring knowledge of the corresponding private key. This is usually not a problem unless if you require signatures to be unique or use them to identify items."

Does this help @leonardoalt and @chriseth ?

And I wonder if we should hold off on merging until that OZ PR is merged? As I'm not sure this doc is true until that point?

(copying from a comment on the PR): the "high s" problem, and why the ecrecover precompile behavior was left unchanged when high s became invalid for transactions, is discussed in the Homestead EIP http://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2.
