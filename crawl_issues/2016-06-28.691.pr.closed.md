# [\#691 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/691) `closed`: Add specific web3 example for getStorageAt

It took me a LONG time to figure out how to get this working in web3.js, there is no documentation or examples of how to do it.

This would have made things a lot easier :)

I think this would better fit in the documentation for web3, no?

Up to you guys, I can move it to https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#web3ethgetstorageat no problem

@chriseth what say you? Do we add this or suggest he go to web3 with his example?

I think it is a good idea to have some more web3.js examples, but this one should be extended to say what the result of the query is.
