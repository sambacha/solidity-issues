clean up the typos and you should be ready to merge.

Some general comments copied from gitter: 

I think a ‘how not to get borked by too many customers’ section might be nice — current gas limits mean you can’t send more than a few hundred txs out at one time, hence the current best practice of letting users withdraw themselves. It would be nice to have a viable “chunking through your big list” solution out there in examples as well, just in case.

I was thinking how this would be done, I think you’d reverse iterate through the list and delete as you went, that way if you did get some contract with 1mm entries in it, you could at least parse through them if you had instrumented the parser to work backwards and shorten the array

@vessenes yes, we could add an example on how to do vote counting in a loop.

```
/// This is a very simple example and does not have any sybil-attack protection.
/// It is only used to illustrate how to tally votes in multiple runs.
/// If sybil-attacks are prevented using tokens, any token transfer during tallying
/// should void the vote of the sender.
contract c {
  bool tallying;
  address[] voters;
  mapping(address => uint) votes;
  function vote(uint option) returns (bool) {
    if (tallying) return false;
    if (votes[msg.sender] > 0) return false;
    if (option == 0) return false;
    voters.push(msg.sender);
    votes[msg.sender] = option;
  }
  mapping(uint => uint) voteResult;
  function tally() {
    tallying = true;
    // Run the loop only as long as we have gas
    // TODO: determine the gas costs of a single iteration
    while (voters.length > 0 && msg.gas > 10000) {
      var voter = voters[voters.length - 1];
      voteResult[votes[voter]] += 1;
      voters.length--;
      delete votes[voter];
    }
  }
}

```

I'm tempted to say for the meanwhile to use an update contract of some kind so that you can update your contracts should you run into flaws. But package managers should be there for that, right?

One thing about update contracts is that there are not good canonical instructions for how to decide what use cases you want, much less solid bomb proof libraries out there. 

Most ugprades will completely break any security model, so it is non-trivial to just 'upgrade'. They also add legal liability in many cases. I love the idea, but it's complicated, really complicated, and depends heavily on use cases to get the right solution in place.

@vessenes not sure I agree with you. We do it via a DOUG at Eris all the time.

Thanks for all your help! I updated according to some suggestions. I would prefer merging this first and adding new paragraphs and sections in alter pull requests. Comments are of course again very welcome!
