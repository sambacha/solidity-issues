Dear god your code is beautiful and elegant.

although I have one gripe...you think you can use namespace std and clean up the stds lying around?

@VoR0220 really it looks clean, thank you

Sorry if I was too hash on the python code. I'm actually not too sure if re-implementing it in C++ improves the dependency situation, at least python is platform-independent. More and more of our development tools move to javascript, but I guess this can be easily re-implemented in javascript. So yeah, let's get this merged :-)

Could you please add more documentation to the functions and also the the doc tool itself? I also have some comments on the coding style.

@chriseth Linking with `libsolidity` is more opportunities such as direct access to AST, python script can't do it unfortunately. In the first step I try to make Python bindings for `libsolidity` but coding lite c++ app is simple little bit.

@chriseth lgtm for a merge.

Wouldn't it make more sense having this as an external tool? The AST, devdoc, userdoc is exported via the JSON compiler interface so it could be easily used outside, even in Javascript (via solc-js).

This is simple external tool linked with `libsolidity`, it no need `node`, `npm` and more, more deps for the run. So, when it's needlessly - just close.

There's this tool now, which probably is relevant to this PR: https://github.com/DigixGlobal/doxity (cc @hitchcott)

I have to admit, doxity looks really nice.

@axic Looks pretty, thanks.
