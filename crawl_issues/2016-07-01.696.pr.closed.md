msg.gas  (uint): remaining gas
It isn't remaining gas, it is estimated gas by sender.

Why do you think so? `msg.gas` maps to the `GAS` opcode which returns the remaining gas.

Because:
- If it is remaining gas it should be `block.remaininggas` or `block.gas`.
- I have tested on private net and is estimated gas by sender that why it's belong to `msg` (msg is an object contain information about incoming transaction, isn't right ?).

Ah, ok, now I see where you are going at. Yes, the naming could be better. The `msg` object, though, is the correct place: the `GAS` opcode neither concerns the transaction nor the block, because it is the amount of gas available to the current call, so its context is the same as e.g. `msg.sender` - it can change with every call.

Something like _remaining gas available_ may be better naming? I don't think _estimated gas_ truly reflects what's happening, though.

@chriseth @Denton-L @tad88dev what do we think would be a better name in this case?

I like the current name. I feel it's nice and concise and gives sufficient indication of what the variable represents.

Closing this pr as invalid - discussion about renaming can continue in an issue if desired.
