# [\#697 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/697) `closed`: Ensure addr.call.value() is invoked

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577353?u=04b67112d6f4b43f526da3cb9fd88aeb18223b22&v=4" width="50">[aakilfernandes](https://github.com/aakilfernandes) opened issue at [2016-07-01 16:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/697):

contract Test {
        function Test(){
            msg.sender.call.value(0);
            msg.sender.call.value(0)();
        }
    }

My understanding is the first call doesn't actually do anything. If so, it shouldn't compile

Are you recommending a warning? It is not a compiler error, because you could do things like:

```
contract Test {
  function test() {
    var x = msg.sender.call.value(0);
    x();
  }
}
```

I think this would be a good place for a warning, since we're ignoring a return value from a low-level function. Related: #677

@chriseth didn't realize you could store it as a variable. I think a warning would be apt.

Is it useful storing it is a variable, though?

@axic Solidity should not impose artificial restrictions. It is useful to store functions in variables and the ether amount and gas sent together with a function is part of it.

So if `msg.sender.call.value(0)` is not assigned to a variable and is not executed, then the compiler should emit a warning.

I don't think this is an issue anymore with the new syntax.
