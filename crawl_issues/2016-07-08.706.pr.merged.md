I feel like this is very rough, currently. Please let me know about what improvements I can make with this!

resolve #705

I have no idea why the build is failing right now.

@chriseth, do you have any suggestions on what kind of example might be a good one to use?

@Denton-L the auction example already has the withdrawal pattern, perhaps we could borrow a snippet from there?

@chriseth, I have included a modified version of the auction example.

Sorry, but I'm not really keen on just repeating the auction example here. If the pattern cannot be shown properly in isolation, then we should rather link to the auction example.

Sorry, I've been busy for the past little bit. I've updated it so that it uses a different example, the "store" example. This should be shorter and simpler than the auction example.

Thanks for the update. Sorry to say that, but I think that also this is not the best example. Examples where you really need the withdrawal patterns are those where the person triggering the action does not necessarily benefit from the transfer.

In the example here, you could just use `if(!x.send(y)) throw` - and in fact you should because otherwise this example will generate a compiler warning. Using `throw` does not harm here, because it does not stall a process. Where you cannot use throw and have to use withdraw is where the sending is part of another process that can then be stalled by the person receiving the funds.

Would a [King of the Ether](https://www.kingoftheether.com/)-type example work, then?

It acts as almost an Auction contract without as much complexity.

Yes, that's a good idea!

@chriseth, as in #913, I changed the example such that it does not throw anymore.
