### Description:

Consider a conract

```
contract FooFactory {
   event NewFoo(Foo foo);
    function createFoo() returns (Foo foo){
        foo = new Foo();
        NewFoo(foo);
    }
}
```

a call to `createFoo()` creates an entry in log like 

```
{ logIndex: '0x00',
  transactionIndex: '0x0',
  transactionHash: '0xfbfd11df8f5bdeda926b516485737caf139b0f3eff3a74b3dda50bf6147953fb',
  blockHash: '0x4fa25c52f80357761a8c491ff31c3c74b59dd7e9120cb0e1486cdee740a45742',
  blockNumber: '0x65',
  address: '0x667cbea674e29efcb90fd5938a61fc8b226a3722',
  data: '0x0000000000000000000000000194013ad981e20f9bb2cd6d4aecbdf95d4485cb',
  topics: [ '0x09cf5831812c5045f6913dec697b94aaf101ab015f2f3e56356ed092df26becd' ],
  type: 'mined' }
```

the event's topic is a result of computation `web3.sha3('NewFoo(address)')` an not `web3.sha3('NewFoo(Foo)')` as expected. You can also see other differences between these two log entries.

If I declare an even like `event NewFoo(address foo);` in the same contract, it produces a log entry as expected:

```
{ logIndex: 0,
  transactionIndex: 0,
  transactionHash: '0x820cb70909b81c536830e32db5fd70873cc481a2839f218bc818db3842e6b5eb',
  blockHash: '0xe5d61b1022acdc46ad99ab4ee63af96155121e68e84bc0b5f1c45c825746170a',
  blockNumber: 95,
  address: '0xe1ec40eccc040f9e48f34871e6f3c1d30b4cc9e5',
  type: 'mined',
  event: 'NewFoo',
  args: { foo: '0xb2dcf81abf338024afaf870f947d9c1716933e05' } }
```

### Use Case justification:

I would like to use contract declaration like `event NewFoo(Foo foo);` instead of `event NewFoo(address foo);` in order to generate an ABI for `event NewFoo(Foo foo);` and use the ABI to resolve a promise direct to Contract not to address.

The reason is that contracts are not part of the ABI types. The same transformation also applies to function signatures.

Adding custom types to the ABI might be a possibility to consider, but I am not sure if we want to go down that road. You only get (a mild version of) type safety if the full contract is known to web3.js, and I don't see a nice way to provide that in a general context.

What is a feature and what is a bug here? It is not quit clear to me.

I see the `Foo` type is already used in the ABI of the `FooFactory`, created by solidity compiler.
`[{"constant":false,"inputs":[],"name":"createFoo","outputs":[{"name":"foo","type":"address"}],"type":"function"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"name":"foo","type":"Foo"}],"name":"NewFoo","type":"event"}]`
is this a feature and not a bug?

The `FooFactory.createFoo()` call creates an log entry with the topic different from the event signature declared in the ABI. 
Is this a feature and not a bug too?

Even this behaviour is intentional, it contradicts at least to solidity documentation, stating that the topic is a sha3 of event signature (as defined in contract or exposed in ABI).

Additionally it is not quite clear why a json entry `event: 'NewFoo',` is missing. Is this an anonymous event? Does the event become anonymous due to ContractType usage in event's signature?

Personlly I find it usefull if ABI string contains ContractTypes. It makes easier for UI-Engine to render correct UI for address or for the contract at that address. If an event could have any string as a topic, I would prefer to have a topic calculated from the event signatur as defined in contract and exposed in ABI, i.e. as `web3.sha3(NewFoo(Foo))`.  If the topic could be any string, why solidity compiler needs to transform the event signature for the topic calculation?

This needs further investigation, I am actually not sure whether it is a bug or a feature. As far as datatypes are concerned, web3.js should not be able to know what `Foo` might be, at least it is not defined in the ABI, but I certainly see the benefit here. The main problem is that contract names are not globally unique as opposed to all the other type names in the ABI.

I see the problem. Thank you.
Let me know if I could contribute to find a solution.

Currently this uses `address` both for the event and `createFoo` and it seems to decode properly in remix ide:

```
[
  {
    "type":"function"
    "name":"createFoo",
    "payable":false,
    "constant":false,
    "inputs":[
    ],
    "outputs":[
      {
        "name":"foo",
        "type":"address"
      }
    ],
  },
  {
    "type":"event",
    "name":"NewFoo",
    "anonymous":false,
    "inputs":[
      {
        "indexed":false,
        "name":"foo",
        "type":"address"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Is this still a bug?

I don't think so. Closing.
