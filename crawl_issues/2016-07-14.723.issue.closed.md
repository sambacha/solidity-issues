I'm working on a relay scheme where relayers get paid if a transaction they are relayed is mined. one way to do this would pass 1) a transaction to relay 2) a contract which pays the relayer if and only if the transaction has been mined.

Afaik, 2) is not currently possible.

I don't think this is possible in Ethereum at the moment without hard-forking and making breaking changes to the EVM.

This is possible by providing Merkle proofs from the transaction hash to the block hash and actually not too complicated, but it is not in scope of a compiler feature.

@chriseth Sounds good. I'm investigating that approach. Would you be able to point me in the direction regarding a formula for proving that? I also opened up a stack exchange question here: http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/7147/given-a-blockhash-how-can-i-prove-a-transaction-with-a-given-hash-has-been-mine/7177#7177
