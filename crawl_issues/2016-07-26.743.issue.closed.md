# [\#743 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/743) `closed`: Log events do not fire inside functions with modifiers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7771080?u=53a491557a1d827ec5b73819759cb2622d6a71c5&v=4" width="50">[nisamson](https://github.com/nisamson) opened issue at [2016-07-26 22:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/743):

```
/**
 * Vault with notifications
 * 
 */
contract Vault{


    // only the owner can touch this contract
    address vaultOwner;


    /**
     * A modifier that ensures only the vault owner can execute function
     */
    modifier foo {

    }

    event FooEvent(string email);


    /**
     * Emits event log when user registered to receive notifications
     */
    function fooFunc(string email)  {
        FooEvent(email);
    }

    /**
     * Emits event log when user registered to receive notifications
     */
    function fooFuncWithModifier(string email)  foo {
        FooEvent(email);
    }


}
```

The above contract code will fire off the FooEvent event in the function without the modifier, but not the one with the modifier. 

Looking at the disassembly, LOG opcodes are not being produced at all when fooFunc is omitted. I can't find anything suggesting that this behavior is intentional.

An example of this contract demonstrating the bug is available on the test net at:
