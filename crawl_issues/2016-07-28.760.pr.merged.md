@bobsummerwill @chriseth Seems like the library feature I'm using is present since about the [0.7.0 release](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/releases/tag/0.7.0) of jsoncpp.

Travis on Linux is using this outdated version from 2011:

```
Setting up libjsoncpp-dev:amd64 (0.6.0~rc2-3ubuntu1) ...
```

The latest version is 1.7.4. Since [version 0.9.4](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/releases/tag/0.9.4) has "full UTF-8 support", maybe it would make sense recommending that version and having it available in Travis?

Travis on OSX has a newer version which compiles.

Right.   And we're using a newer version for Windows too:   https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-dependencies/releases/tag/vc140

Is there a simple "if jsoncpp version > x.x.x" conditional which you could put around this call as a stop-gap measure?

Then I can also update the `install_deps.sh` for Solidity as part of my pending "Solidity standalone" PR, where we would do an install-from-source to get a newer version, and could remove the conditional again at that point.

When Solidity standalone and cpp-ethereum-v1.3.1 "land", both the Travis/Appveyor and "building from source" instructions will switch to use `install_deps.sh`, where we still have manual per-distro instructions at the moment.

Please rebase.

Perhaps better to wait for the outcome of #789. That could simplify the above code.

Can be merged after #1252.

Actually this made me wondering. Every JSON output (ie. libevmasm) is passed as a `JsonValue`, except the interface, which outputs `string`.

It perhaps would make sense changing that to `JsonValue` too and keep every JSON serialisation call within the `jsonCompiler`.

Yes, makes sense. I think in the beginning we were reluctant to spill json across the codebase.
