# [\#762 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/762) `merged`: Optimizer

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-07-29 15:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/762):

Fixes #692 

The "combining knowledge" feature of the optimizer already caused a lot of trouble in the past because of invalid write sequences (i.e. the optimizer thought that some information has already been written to memory and thus does not write it anymore) especially connected to loops and jumps.

This change erases all knowledge about the state in case two control flow paths are merged (which is also the case if there is only a single unknown jump destination in the code).
