do {} while (); can avoid code duplication in some situations.

Hi there!  I'm new to the Solidity project, but I had a spare night and thought I'd try my hand at making a contribution on this front.  Casual testing suggests it's ok, but solc on the "development" branch crashes for asm and asm-json outputs on my Mac, so I need to switch over to my Linux machine in the morning to keep up the testing.  I also couldn't find a compiler test suite to add some appropriate tests to.

The PR is to hopefully get a conversation started so I can finish that up.

I think we can close this one now.
