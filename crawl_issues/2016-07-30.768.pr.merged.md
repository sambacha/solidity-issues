# [\#768 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/768) `merged`: Add support for do/while loops

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614752?u=1565826f2b2d74054639e6500236b073aa10f81a&v=4" width="50">[roadriverrail](https://github.com/roadriverrail) opened issue at [2016-07-30 07:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/768):

This commit adds support for a standard do <statement> while <expr>;
form of statement.  While loops were already being supported; supporting
a do/while loop mostly involves reusing code from while loops but putting
the conditional checking last.

This commit resolves issue #766

Thanks for the pull request and your interest in the project! We have to think about whether introducing do-while-loops is something we want to be part of the language or if they are an unnecessary complication. If you want to work on features that have already been agreed by the community, please talk to a team member in https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity

Will change this to re-use the existing while loop ast node.

Were you going to do that yourself in the next couple of days?  I have a road trip coming up tomorrow, and I might have the free evening or two to do that.

oh wow, even the better :-)
So the idea is to re-use the while loop ast node to reduce complexity and add a flag to it telling whether it is a do-while or a while-do-loop. It is important that this flag is also output for the two ast outputs.

Yeah, as soon as I saw your comment, I figured that's what you had in mind.  I haven't looked at solc since I wrote this (major life changes), but I assume you already have some sort of context variable that gets passed around that I could store the flag in.  Most compilers do.

At the point where the ast node is created in the parser, this flag should be stored inside the ast node as a regular class member.

Got it.  Makes perfect sense.

Okay; this appears to be functionally comparable code without the extra class.  Also, I saw that Why3 does not appear to support do-while, so I simulate a do-while loop for its output.  I'm going to have to look at a rebase next, since the commit from main that this branch is based on has a broken "ast" and "ast-json" output.

Thanks! The last thing that is missing now is an entry into the changelog file and some mention of this feature in the documentation. I can also do that after merging this PR if you want.
Oh and it seems we have a conflict in grammar.txt :-(

Yeah, I'll do the pickup merging on grammar.txt.  I can get the changelog
and docs updated, too.  Also, do you have some sort of testing framework I
should look into writing some tests for?

Oh of course, totally forgot about tests. I think it is enough to add an end to end test, so take a look at the file SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp. You can probably copy an example there. Running the tests is a bit tricky, because you need an `eth` node. Start it with `eth --test -d /tmp/test` and then run `soltest -- --ipcpath /tmp/test/geth.ipc` (or just run `scripts/test.sh`).

Since we're mostly done with the CR process, I squashed the commits, updated the Changelog, and added some mention of "do" to the docs, though documentation of the control structures is pretty light.

Okay.  I should be able to add a test.  Tonight's a pretty tight schedule, but Wednesday or Thursday should be a little bit better.

Okay.  I added a basic unit test modeled on the while loop test.  I see it runs the test repeatedly with different values of n and checks it against what you expect from C++, and that seems suitable enough.  I could get fancier, I suppose, with nesting and all that jazz, if there's a need.

Sincerely sorry about the style violations; I thought I checked every line for spaces last night, but it was late.  Fixed.

Thanks for the patience in the review process.  solc is pretty easy to work on, so I'm hoping this will not be the last time you'll be seeing a PR from me.

That's great to hear! The issues marked as "soon" and/or "up-for-grabs" are probably the best to work on. If in doubt, ask on http://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity or contact me at chris@ethereum.org
