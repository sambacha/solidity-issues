Replaces https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/739.

This commit is the culmination of several months of work to decouple Solidity from the webthree-umbrella so that it can be developed in parallel with cpp-ethereum (the Ethereum C++ runtime) and so that even for the Solidity unit-tests there is no hard-dependency onto the C++ runtime.

The Tests-over-IPC refactoring was a major step in the same process which was already committed.

This commit contains the following changes:
- A subset of the CMake functionality in webthree-helpers was extracted and tailored for Solidity into ./cmake.   Further cleanup is certainly possible.
- A subset of the libdevcore functionality in libweb3core was extracted and tailored for Solidity into ./libdevcore.   Further cleanup is certainly possible
- The gas price constants in EVMSchedule were orphaned into libevmasm.
- Some other refactorings and cleanups were made to sever unnecessary EVM dependencies in the Solidity unit-tests.
- TravisCI and Appveyor support was added, covering builds and running of the unit-tests (Linux and macOS only for now)
- A bug-fix was made to get the Tests-over-IPC running on macOS.
- There are still reliability issues in the unit-tests, which need immediate attention.    The Travis build has been flipped to run the unit-tests 5 times, to try to flush these out.
- The Emscripten automation which was previously in webthree-umbrella was merged into the TravisCI automation here.
- The development ZIP deployment step has been commented out, but we will want to read that ONLY for release branch.

Further iteration on these changes will definitely be needed, but I feel these have got to sufficient maturity than holding them back further isn't winning us anything.    It is go time :-)

Yeah, @VoR0220.   I know :-)
