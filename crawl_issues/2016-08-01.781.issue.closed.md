# [\#781 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/781) `closed`: Remove non-solidity exception types

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-08-01 10:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/781):

There are several macros that define exceptions (for example `DEV_SIMPLE_EXCEPTION`) that are leftovers from cpp-ethereum and are not relevant for Solidity. Most of the exceptions that are not defined in `libsolidity/interface/Exceptions.h` can be removed.
