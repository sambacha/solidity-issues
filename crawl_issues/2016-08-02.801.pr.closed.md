`after` was not documented on purpose because I think its syntax is grossly misleading, especially if used together with timestamps. Take for example `if (now > after deadline)` - it does not do what you would expect it to do.

On the other hand, the meaning of `now + 1 day` is much easier to understand.

Hmmm, should we just close this and leave it undocumented, then?

If the keyword is ambiguous, shouldn't it be removed from the language instead?
