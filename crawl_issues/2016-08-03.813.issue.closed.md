# [\#813 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/813) `closed`: I have a compile error on Ubuntu 16.04...

I was running

```
./webthree-helpers/scripts/ethbuild.sh --no-git --project solidity --cores 4 -DEVMJIT=0 -DETHASHCL=0
```

as suggested in http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html
I had followed the previous build instructions.

I hope this is the right place to raise the issue.

The error was:

```
In file included from ethereum/webthree-umbrella/solidity/libdevcore/Base64.h:32:0,
                 from ethereum/webthree-umbrella/solidity/libdevcore/Base64.cpp:29:
ethereum/webthree-umbrella/solidity/libdevcore/Common.h:61:67: fatal error:         boost_multiprecision_number_compare_bug_workaround.hpp: No such file or directory
```

My git repo is up to date.

Sorry, we are just migrating to a new build system. I updated the build instructions: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/816
Please check if they work for you, thanks!

Thanks for your response.

I've followed your changes, including installing `libjsoncpp-dev`, and still hit the same error.
