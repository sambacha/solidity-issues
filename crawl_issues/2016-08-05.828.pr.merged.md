:white_check_mark: [Build solidity 0.3.5.26 completed](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ethereum/solidity/build/0.3.5.26) (commit https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/c5c30b12c1 by @axic)

Currently Solidity over-stipends gas for the identity contract, except in the case of 0-length memory, where it doesn't sends enough.

Though it shouldn't use the identity contract for 0-length memory.
