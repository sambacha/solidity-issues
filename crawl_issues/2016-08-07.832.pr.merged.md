This would be fine, even though I don't see why the already-existing `0x` notation cannot be extended. Currently `0x000000ff` works for `uint32`s. If they would be allowed to be indefinitely long and also assignable to the `bytes` type, a new notation is not required.

This was debated in the issue #479.

Actually, `0x` is not. I will post my remark there.

`0x` was the initial suggestion, see the top of the issue.

When will this be available in browser solidity?

@stevenroose it already is. We recently changed browser-solidity to load the latest stable version by default instead of the latest nightly build (this is not yet too visible from the version string, but will be soon). You can change the version using the drop-down menu.

I was trying in the browser when I mailed that and it did not work. Even
though I indeed noticed that the latest build was shown..
