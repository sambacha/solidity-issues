# [\#833 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/833) `merged`: Reserved keywords update

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-08-07 17:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/833):

Add `abstract` and `interface` to the list of reserved keywords. Also add `payable`.

Move `as` and `using` from the reserved list as they're already used.

where are we including these keywords? What issues are these being talked about in? :) Sorry I feel a bit in the dark right here.

#665, #649 and #847 

I think it is good measure reserving those generic ones (such as `abstract` and `interface`), I'd go as far as also reserving `class`, `instance`, and `static`.

There is the idea of distinguishing between functions that are actual constants (i.e. do not read from state) and functions that do not modify state. Having `static` as a keyword there would be helpful.
