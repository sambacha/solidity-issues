ahhhhh....this old gem....it does work, but there's still the problem when it comes to being able to pass in a dup1 as being set to a variable...any chance we can get that here? Then I'll be able to merge my fixed point PR right up. 

EDIT: Upon actually looking at the code, there are some small differences from the sample code you gave me and upon implementing it...it would appear that it does indeed work.

nope...tried again....and it isn't working....I think we need to determine where m_context is getting passed to in terms of identifiers in a generic way, what do you think?
