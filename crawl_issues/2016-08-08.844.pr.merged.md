# [\#844 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/844) `merged`: BREAKING: Remove after

I would like to issue a compiler error stating that `after` is deprecated if someone attempts to use it but I'm not quite sure which file I should put that in. @chriseth, could I have a little bit of help?

Resolve #815

I don't think you necessarily need to add an error to it, it never was really in use, just was reserved in the token list. A simple removal should do. 

Edit: Okay it was in use...but a warning should suffice instead of an error.

Sorry, just noticed your comment.

I think @chriseth wanted `after` completely removed from the compiler in #815, though, so I don't think a warning would suffice.

@Denton-L just treat it as an identifier from now on. In order to throw an error for it, you'd have to reserve it as a keyword which is exactly what we're eliminating...so I'm not sure what the procedure would be for this unless you were to specify the identifier "after" in the context in which it was previously used and then throw an error for that.

Hmmm, it builds locally on my machine... Not sure why it's failing the CI.

HEAD is showing as broken in Appveyor, so all the PRs are broken too.

I am investigating right now, @Denton-L.

Broken was introduced at https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ethereum/solidity/build/0.3.5.88

Could you `git push --force` it, @Denton-L?
Or just merge/rebase your PR?   Should work now against current HEAD, I think.
