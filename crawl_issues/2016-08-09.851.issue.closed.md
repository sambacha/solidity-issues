Hey, @Hibryda,

Yes, Christian is in the process of switching our PPAs over, with cpp-ethereum and solidity being split apart.

What you can do in the short-term is uninstall cpp-ethereum and then the solidity install should work.

We will get the "shapes" right in the very near future!   Best wishes.

This is the issue I have too.

You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 solc : Depends: libethereum (= 1.2.9-SNAPSHOT--20160628-6a05dd7~trusty-0ubuntu1) but 1.2.9-SNAPSHOT--20160630-f09ff00~trusty-0ubuntu1 is to be installed
E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

It should be fixed now, can you test, please (apt-get update && apt-get upgrade)?

@bobsummerwill Yes, ultimately will purge cpp-eth. Just informed about the issue.

You will need to uninstall cpp-ethereum first.   Please could you try that, @Hibryda?

We'll get them all the right shape soon.    Just clashy during the transition, which is proving very painful.

@bobsummerwill I uninstalled cpp-ethereum, but this wasn't the total resolution. I also had to get rid of libethereum because it locked installation of solc. But without libethereum there was no candidate for update - an effect of split of these entities. So had to manually force solc to install from deb package at the end.
So the path was as follows:
sudo apt-get remove --purge cpp-ethereum
sudo apt-get remove --purge libethereum
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade #(no candidates)
sudo dpkg -i /path/to/solc_pack
sudo apt-get install -f
I did it this way (with success) and actually cannot see easier way, as these the libethereum and solc interlock. This should be fixed somehow.

Ah, and I could actually make it easier of course, just force installing without dependencies, but wanted a cleaner version to be sure. Now it works fine.

Thanks for the detailed report! We will improve the experience once we have new cpp-ethereum ppa packages.

the main problem is this;

trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/libsolidity.so', which is also in package solc:amd64 1:0.3.6-0ubuntu1~trusty

/usr/lib/libsolidity.so is contained inside two packages that both need to be installed together. it's impossible to do so otherwise, as apt-get checks this....

I'm sorry, yes, until we have new ppa packages for cpp-ethereum they cannot be both installed at the same time.

It can temporarily done by repacking one of packages: ar, edit control archive, pack again. Dirty, but should do the job.

I am still having the same issue, and my whole apt system broke, is there any way to fix this? I tried to the commands above, didn't work.
