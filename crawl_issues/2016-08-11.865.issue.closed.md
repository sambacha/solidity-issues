Please try if `sudo apt-get remove cpp-ethereum libethereum && sudo apt-get install solc`  helps

solc and libethereum have conflicting packages within them..... this needs to be fixed!

cannot install libethereum & solc at the same time. is impossible. it's either install one, or the other!

apt-get did not properly uninstall libethereum before installing solc. Please try

```
apt-get remove libethereum solc cpp-ethereum
```

and then

```
apt-get install solc
```

Yes, you cannot have both at the same time, at the moment, sorry for the inconvenience.

@chriseth @codati @simpletechnology

Hi,

Try to execute this to resolve the probleme.

  rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/ethkey*
  rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/eth:*
  rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/ethm*
  rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/libeth*
  apt-get -f install

We just created new packages for the PPA, solidity and lll are no longer part of cpp-ethereum and libethereum and thus should not create a conflict anymore.
