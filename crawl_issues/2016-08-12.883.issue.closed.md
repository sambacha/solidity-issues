# [\#883 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/883) `closed`: Warn about invalid utf8 sequences in strings
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Any literal that is a string should not contain invalid utf8 sequences.

The main problem in implementing is that contextual information is needed here. The literal itself does not yet "know" whether it will be used as a string or as a raw byte value. This means that such a check should be performed at the point of type conversion:

Literal strings with invalid utf8 sequences that are converted to an actual string will trigger a warning.
