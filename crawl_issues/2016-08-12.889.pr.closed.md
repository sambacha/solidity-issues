# [\#889 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/889) `closed`: Update and rename style-guide.rst to coding-standards.rst

Style Guide is misleading as title. For consistency, I propose "Coding Standards" - this is also used for the C++ coding standards -> ethereum/webthree-umbrella/CodingStandards.txt
It seems that "Standard" invites people to align more than "Guide".

I don't think that style guide is misleading. The term is used by e.g. Python: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
Also the term 'standard' somehow suggests that you can reject source code that does not adhere to the standard, which is neither the case nor something we would like to achieve.
