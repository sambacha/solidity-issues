# [\#922 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/922) `closed`: AST output: literal_string with non-UTF8 should have the "value" field escaped

Here is a minimal example that recreates the bug:

```
contract err {
    bytes constant example = hex"80";
}
```

Returns error:

```
Uncaught JavaScript exception:
SyntaxError: Unexpected token : in JSON at position 14716
```

Seems that hex strings beginning with digits higher than 8 throw this error

`hex"80"` seems to cause an invalid utf8 sequence in the compiler output.

AST output:

```
    Literal, token: [no token] value: ?
       Type: literal_string (contains invalid UTF-8 sequence at position 0)
       Source: "hex\"80\""
```

AST JSON output:

```
                            {
                                "string" : null,
                                "type" : "literal_string (contains invalid UTF-8 sequence at position 0)",
                                "value" : "?"
                            },
```

The character 0x80 is in the output where the question mark is. We should probably print a hex escaped version in the AST JSON and perhaps in the AST as well?
