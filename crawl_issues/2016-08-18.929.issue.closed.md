# [\#929 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/929) `closed`: When a function in a contract is called, if the gas limit is not enough, the out-of-gas exception occurs and the sender loses his gas. How to know in advance how much gas enough for any arguments values passed to the function?
