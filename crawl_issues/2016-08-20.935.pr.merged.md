# [\#935 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/935) `merged`: Version pragma

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-08-20 00:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/935):

Most important: This change will generate a warning for all source files that do not include a "version pragma".

It adds support for `pragma solidity ^0.3.6;`, where the match expression can be almost anything that is also supported by npm, so you can have fancy stuff like `pragma solidity 0.1.5 - 0.1.7 || ^0.3.0;`, although I think 99% of the people will just use the first example.

This PR contains changes to a lot of tests because that pragma had to be inserted everywhere. When we merge (and release) this, we have to insert such a statement also into all code examples if we do not want the warnings to appear.

I have some complains.
1. Why the char `^` is used? Is there any other system that uses it? I'd prefer something like in pip: `solidity >= 0.4.0`, `solidity>=0.2,<0.3` not because it looks better but because at least some group of developers will be familiar with.
2. Why keyword `pragma` has been used? Wouldn't `version solidity >= 0.4` be better?

It is npm's definition of semver-based matching: https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver

It is widely used within the JS community.

Wouldn't it make sense having those changes included in this  PR?

@chfast using `pragma` allows us to add similar statements without breaking the parser, i.e. without introducing new keywords. You actually can use `pragma solidity >=0.2 <0.3`, `^0.4.0` is just an abbreviation for `>=0.4.0 <0.5.0`.

Discussion about which keyword to use was here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/226

@chriseth So does the lexer extracts string after `pragma` until end of line and passes it to external pragma parser?

@axic not sure about already adding pragmas to the documentation. I think readthedocs is currently configured to show "latest" and not "stable". There is a separate story about going through the docs before the next release, I will do it as part of that. We can change the readthedocs config with the next release, too.

@chfast yes, the lexer consumes anything that is not `;` and stores it as a stream of lexer tokens inside the pragma ast node for further processing.

@axic @chfast thumbsup for this?

I'm still not a fan of pragma, but don't have a better suggestion :)
