**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

The Solidity docs can be simplified to use `scripts/install_deps.sh` and `scripts/install_deps.bat`, as we have already done for `cpp-ethereum`.

The current "long-form" instructions are no longer necessary, especially because the Solidity instructions only cover macOS and Ubuntu.
