We should follow TypeScript (and other popular languages) more closely and change variable declarations to `identifier: typename`, this also makes it much easier to distinguish the typename from the identifier.

We can keep the C-style notation as an alternative.

I think this makes sense if we can nicely encapsulate `constant` and `public` in this (and perhaps storage variables).

i.e.

```
// variables
var name:type;
let name:type;

// constants
const name:type;

// storage
storage name:type;
state name:type;
```

Not sure about public, memory and references?

Question:
- Where to put `constant`, `public`, etc?
- What about storage and memory reference types, will that still be part of the type?

From Pivotaltracker:
> `<identifier>: <type>` should be a possible variable declaration. If `: <type>` is omitted, this defaults to "inferred" for local variables and "uint" for everything else.
> This might be a problem in some places where the name of the variable may be omitted (parameter lists).
> For a certain time, this should be allowed in parallel to the old way to declare variables.
> We might also use `function x(): retType` for the returns declaration.
> In general, lean towards how TypeScript does it.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
