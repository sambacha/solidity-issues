Let's not do this, @chriseth.
The expressions are getting to be completely crazy.

It would be better to only do OS X Mavericks in all cases than to have these conditionals.    And if we can do more parallel builds, all the better.

We have built each of the OS X variants on a different machine, so that there is 1-1 between the bottles and local "build from source", but we could choose to push the same bottles for all of them, I think.
