Does the output from this expression come through the same?  ie. short-form commit?

I know that with some of my TravisCI and Appveyor efforts with commits, they come through as beast-hashes which you really wouldn't want in a filename.

ie.

7b9ba417bea0b1de785250429b4d062f9747aa10

when you want

7b9ba41

True, I hadn't even considered that. `$TRAVIS_COMMIT` returns the long hash which isn't desired.
