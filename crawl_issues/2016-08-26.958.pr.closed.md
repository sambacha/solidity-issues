# [\#958 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/958) `closed`: Require "payable" modifier if function wants to receive ether.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-08-26 17:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/958):

Work in progress

Replaces https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/665

Partially implements #500 and #563. Comments welcome.

Fixes #602.

todo:
- [ ] library function should not be payable
- [ ] `contract is payable` should create payable fallback function (and error if there already is one)
- [ ] calling a non-payable function with value set should report an error
- [ ] accessor functions should not be able to receive ether (-> callvalue check should probably move to dispatcher)
- [ ] internal functions should not allow payable modifier
- [ ] overwriting a base contract function should not change payable
