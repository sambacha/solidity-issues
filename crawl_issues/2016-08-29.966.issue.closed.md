# [\#966 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/966) `closed`: using input of `0` in sha3 function produces incorrect output 
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

I suspect this is a bug but wanted to report and confirm.
When passing `0` to `sha3` function in Solidity, instead of a predefined `uint` zero-value variable the produced output is incorrect. Sample below

```
contract MyContract
{
    bytes32 public sha3test1;
    bytes32 public sha3test2;
    uint256 zero = 0;

    function MyContract(){

       sha3test1 = sha3(0);
       sha3test2 = sha3(zero);
    }
}
```

produces:

```
sha3test1 = 0xbc36789e7a1e281436464229828f817d6612f7b477d66591ff96a9e064bcc98a
sha3test2 = 0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e563
```

@area has rightly pointed out that Solidity casts to the smallest type hence using a `uint8` for the supplied `0` value. Tests confirm this is the case so closing this.

I'm not sure that is the correct behaviour though for sha3.

In the above case you coerce with `sha3(uint256(0));`, but I would be include to say that constants for tight packing should either:
- be disallowed
- or taken as `uin256`.

If finer granularity is needed they can be typecasted or defined as variables.

The document [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=sha3#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions) could be made a tiny bit more explicit about how it behaves.

Ok, so `sha3(zero)` doesn't work... how does one get it to work as expected?  It would be quite helpful to show how to actually hash a f***ing uint256 somewhere. Tightly packed or not, I don't really care and just want it to work like any sane person would expect.

@beether how do you expect it to work? `sha3(0)` should be the same as `sha3(uint8(0))`, should be the same as
```
uint 8 x = 0;
sha3(x);
```

On the other hand, `sha3(uint(0))` is a different value which should be equal to `uint x = 0; sha3(x);`.
