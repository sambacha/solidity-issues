# [\#970 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/970) `closed`: JsonCompiler should catch exceptions
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-08-29 18:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/970):

[JsonCompiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/jsonCompiler.cpp) is the C binding between Emscripten and Solidity's C++ code: 

C++ exceptions should be caught before returning from the C wrapper. Compiler errors are already wrapped, but anything after for processing the result, doing formal analysis (why3) and building a JSON output is not. 

This will probably "fix" https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/issues/44 (or at least make the error easier to understand).
