# [\#975 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/975) `merged`: solc crashes without 'export LC_ALL=C'

This pull request fixes #674. The issue is that it is possible for the POSIX system environment to be invalid when the program starts, causing a runtime exception to be thrown. The solution is to call setlocale to test that setting the user defined default succeeds, only if the call fails then adjust the environment setting to a reasonable default (else the only viable course of action for the program would be to exit).

Wonderful, thanks!

Ok, I think I understand this better now, thanks! The documentation for `setlocale` tells that "During program startup, the equivalent of `std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "C");` is executed before any user code is run." - so the first call seems redundant, doesn't it?

Can you also explain the preprocessor macros? I guess they are more about the `setenv` call than the `setlocale` call, right? Do neither of the platforms that are specified have this problem?

Upon reviewing the documentation again I am also convinced that the first call to setlocale is redundant as you pointed out setlocale is called before any user code. I'll update the pull request after I've tested the modification.

The preprocessor macros prevent compilation on Windows, OSX and BSD as the change should not be required for those platforms. Any other (POSIX) compatible platform should require the code change. If the only platform that is supported is Linux this could be refactored.

@chriseth I have submitted the stylistic and functional changes you suggested ready for your review.

My recommendation on sticking with `__unix__` is just ease of maintenance.
The calls should be harmless on macOS, FreeBSD, etc.

We'll need this code for `soltest` too.   Sorry!

I've just fixed those ... https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/986

We had a weird bug related to non-ANSI characters in comments when I was working on FIFA.

We were using IncrediBuild (https://www.incredibuild.com/) which does a grid-engine thing to use spare desktop capacity to do massively parallel builds.    That does a transparent virtualization thing, where the submitting PC's environment is replicated elsewhere.    Very clever.   So you don't need Visual Studio installed, or same versions of anything.   It "just works".

Except for this scenario.    Building C++ on a machine with Japanese locale would fall over on non-ANSI characters only if it ran on that node.

It was a horror show to track down.

But yes - non-ANSI in source code is not good!
