For OS X Yosemite, OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra.
All of them are build-only.

Elapsed time: 40 minutes, total time: 1h 20m - retriggered to see how the timing is

Compare-and-contrast with the last few timings on `develop` (https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity/branches)

Elapsed times (total time obviously scales up by the number of configs)
- 28 min 13 sec
- 30 min 56 sec
- 28 min 52 sec
- 27 min 49 sec
- 44 min 25 sec 

So I **think** that as long as TravisCI isn't broken, we're not looking at a significant slowdown (presumably because our paid level support means that most of these targets usually run in parallel).

I think you still have to look at the "total time" and not the "elapsed time". Admitted, this probably depends on the time of day, but almost two hours waiting time is not acceptable for a PR.

Note that we are not yet on paid levels here.

I **think** that the total time is just the sum of all the build steps, and takes no account of whether that work is happening in parallel, or how long you actually waited for a worker to be available for that work.    Adding more projects will obviously increase the total time, but if that is mainly occurring in parallel then it won't make the turnaround slower.

I **think** that the elapsed time is the only really meaningful metric here, if it corresponds to the full end-to-end experience between creating the PR and when all the automation steps complete.

Turnaround is really bad, btw.   I totally agree on that.   Much worse than we had with Jenkins, but without the stability issues.    The stability issues are now all on us - for the tests!

Looks like elapsed time is around 45min-60min at the moment.

This PR shows ...

 Elapsed time 1 hr 3 min 44 sec
 Total time 1 hr 40 min 48 sec

I will just re-run that now to get another datapoint.

I would like to wait at least until after the release and until after we are on a paid plan. I would prefer running all the parallel mac runs only for the develop and release branches, not for the PRs. We have to compare delays due to build errors on develop and delays due to having to wait for the CI to finish.
