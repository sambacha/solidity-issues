# [\#1014 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1014) `merged`: Reject constant modifier on the fallback function

Same as #963, but Github won't allow to reopen it due to the push.

@chriseth see my reasoning in #963. Close if still not convinced.

While I also don't see much sense in having a constant fallback function, I don't see why a v0.4.0 fallback function like `function() {}` shouldn't be constant.

That is the pretty much the only case which is a valid `constant`. Doing anything within (such as `uint x = 1 + 2;`) is still valid, but there's no way to return.
