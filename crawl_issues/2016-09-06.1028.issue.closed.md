# [\#1028 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1028) `closed`: formal verification: model balance changes for a contract with one empty interface function
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

A contract with one empty interface function (like the one below) has at least three kind of balance changes:
1. the interface function (or the fallback function) is called with some value
2. an account calls `SUICIDE` and sends all balance to our account
3. somebody obtains PoW or PoS rewards to our account
This issue is about making the Why3 translation aware of these balance changes.

The contract being considered:

```
contract C
{
        function f() {}
}
```

is currently translated to

```
======= C =======
Formal version:


module UInt256
        use import mach.int.Unsigned
        type uint256
        constant max_uint256: int = 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
        clone export mach.int.Unsigned with
                type t = uint256,
                constant max = max_uint256
end

module Contract_C
        use import int.Int
        use import ref.Ref
        use import map.Map
        use import array.Array
        use import int.ComputerDivision
        use import mach.int.Unsigned
        use import UInt256
        exception Revert
        exception Return
        type state = ()
        type account = {
                mutable balance: uint256;
                storage: state
        }
        val external_call (this: account): bool
                ensures { result = false -> this = (old this) }
                writes { this }
        let rec _f (this: account):
                        ()
                writes { this }
                =
                let prestate = {balance = this.balance; storage = ()} in 
                try
                begin
                end;
                raise Return
                with Return -> () |
                     Revert -> this.balance <- prestate.balance; ()
        end
end
```

whose balance never changes.
- [ ] modeling the balance change by sent values
- [ ] modeling the balance change by other accounts executing `selfdestruct` etc.

Why3 will be removed, so closing this.
