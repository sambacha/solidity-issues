# [\#1029 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1029) `closed`: warn about using msg.value in non-payable function

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-09-06 16:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1029):

The file `SyntaxChecker.cpp` is usually used for such checks. It is a simple AST walker that scans for errors. The way to implement this would be to record in a member when a non-payable public (or external) function is visited and then again when `msg.value` is encountered (or more specifically, an identifier that references the respective magic global).

Using `msg.value` inside non-payable library functions is fine, though.

The question is whether this check should also include an analysis of the call graph, but I think that can be left for a later issue.
