# [\#1034 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1034) `merged`: Shift constants (<< and >>)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-09-06 23:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1034):

Split out of #527, this only handles constants, e.g.

```
contract A {
  uint a = 1 << 128;
}
```

@chriseth @pirapira Any more test cases we could add for this?

<del>Now I'm wondering if SHR is being implemented or SAR is being implemented.</del> From the comments I believe SHR is being implemented, and I'm thinking about padding zeros always.

The documentation should mention this new notation.  Maybe in `Expressions and Control Structures`, but not necessarily in this PR (I'm looking for a place we explain `+`, `-` etc, if there is none I'll create an issue).

@pirapira the only thing we have in documentation is operator precedence.

The documentation thing is deferred to #1166.  I still want to see
- a check against `-20 >> _`
- or, if you choose to implement `SAR`, a test case around it, like `-32 >> 3`.

@pirapira the idea is not to implement shr or sar. The idea is to make `x >> b` a short hand for `x / 2**b`.

@chriseth in that case, there is [a misleading comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1034#discussion_r82175937) and a test is missing about shifting a negative number to the left.

@pirapira @chriseth I think the motivation is clear now, based on http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#rational-and-integer-literals:

> All number literals retain arbitrary precision until they are converted to a non-literal type (i.e. by using them together with a non-literal type). This means that computations do not overflow but also divisions do not truncate.

Note to self: should read the docs more frequently.

@axic @chriseth Then `1 >> 2` should be `1/4`.

@chriseth @pirapira can you review this now? It has more tests and everything passes.
