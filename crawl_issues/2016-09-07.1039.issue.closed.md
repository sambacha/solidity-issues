# [\#1039 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1039) `closed`: formal verification: make readonly Solidity functions available in the specification

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44281?u=19789513178700ad73a6cf535a40fbbfdc1ad615&v=4" width="50">[pirapira](https://github.com/pirapira) opened issue at [2016-09-07 09:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1039):

Currently in the specification (like `///@why3 invariant { ... }`), it's impossible to use contract functions even when they are write-effect-free.   This issue keeps track of allowing it.

Which kind of functions are you referring to? Smart contract methods or pure why3 functions?

Smart contract methods.  I'll change the description.

Why3 will be removed, so closing this.
