# [\#1042 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1042) `closed`: Update solAsserts with a message

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-09-07 12:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1042):

Currently there are 184 `solAsserts` with a message and 171 without. They don't really provide any meaningful output.

I understand that in many cases it would be useless, but there are many where they are. At least when finding a bug, one doesn't need to run a debugger to know where it stopped, but could grep for the message.

solAssert throws a boost exception and should report the line number. Nobody should be forced to grep for a message ;-)

Didn't notice, that should help :)

Nonetheless, in many cases a message could be added. I agree that in some cases it could be superfluous.

Now we have 568 cases in `libsolidity` alone. Quite a bit more than the 171 back in 2016.

I still don't see the real need...

I also don't see the real need since the exception should not happen and it shows the line and file anyway.
@chriseth @axic can we close this?
