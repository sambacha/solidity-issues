# [\#1045 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1045) `merged`: formal verification: Why3 translation of mapping types

Solves #1025 .

After this PR, a state variable `mapping (address => uint256) balance;` is translated into

```
        type state = {
                mutable _balance: array uint256
        }
```

Since the Why3 `array` allows negative indices, the translation works for any `IntegerType`, including signed integers.

While doing that, I wanted an assertion over a shared pointer, so the `assertThrow` macro is also changed.

mappings to mappings do not work currently.  They will be dealt in #1053.

I've addressed the comments and the tests have passed.

The change in error condition looks more verbose now, but should be more concise once we have better coverage of the types, so good change :-)
