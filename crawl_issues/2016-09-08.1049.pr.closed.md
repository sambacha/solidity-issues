# [\#1049 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1049) `closed`: [WIP] Replace the constant keyword with pure and view for functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-09-08 01:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1049):

- [ ] `view` and `pure` cannot use `SSTORE`
- [x] `view` and `pure` cannot be payable
- [ ] `view` and `pure` cannot send ether
- [ ] `view` cannot call functions not declared `view` or `pure`
- [ ] `pure` cannot call functions not declared `pure`
- [ ] `pure` cannot use `SLOAD`
- [ ] `pure` cannot use `msg.*` and `block.*`
- [x] `view` and `pure` are mutually exclusive
- [x] constructor cannot be `view` or `pure`
- [x] fallback cannot be `view` or `pure`
- [x] include `constant` as an alias for `view` in the parser
- [x] include `constant` as an alias for `view` in the JSON ABI
- [x] update grammar.txt

Further things to be sorted: `selfdestruct`, `log` (events), `this.balance`, `address.balance`, `tx.*`, `new` 

Related: #992.

I was wondering how much effort is it to change `constant` to `view` / `pure`. This PR can be closed if we think it is too early (as the design is not finalised yet).

We should wait a bit until we introduce the next breaking changes. We can keep `constant` as an alias for `view` for now.

@chriseth actually the code was like that, supports the `constant` keyword as an alias for `view`. I'll add back the JSON ABI field too.

Internally though I think it makes sense just moving to view / pure.

Please reduce the number of items to be done for this issue - they are a hell of a lot of work. There already is an issue about "enforcing the constant keyword", so please move some of this stuff there, potentially create new issues and interlink them.

I will, the plan for this PR here is only be the non-breaking change.

With the possible addition of `PURE_CALL` to metropolis, this issue will need to be revisited.

Agreed...it does make this issue much easier if that is implemented.

Rebased for good measure.

I think once tests are fixed, this could be merged as is (it just introduces the keywords).

We could change it to an enum as agreed, though we never could settle on a naming:
- `Mutability`: `pure`, `view`, `regular`/`nonpayable`, `payable`.
- `StateAccess`: `none`, `read-only`, `non-payable`, `full`/`payable`.

Split out first step as #2722.

Closing this in favour of the new smaller PRs: #2745 and #2762.
