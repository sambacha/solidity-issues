# [\#1051 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1051) `closed`: formal verification: reconsider `mutable` in `mutable var : array T`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44281?u=19789513178700ad73a6cf535a40fbbfdc1ad615&v=4" width="50">[pirapira](https://github.com/pirapira) opened issue at [2016-09-08 08:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1051):

In Why3, `array` contents are already mutable without the `mutable` keyword, so `mutable var : array T` makes sense only when the length of the array is changed at runtime.  If the array contents are changed but the array length is not changed, `var : array T` is enough.

This issue keeps track of cleaning the `mutable` keyword when the length is known (when the Why3 array appears as a translation of `mapping (address => _)` in Solidity; or deciding not to do that.

There's no keyword in Solidity yet to disallow the extension of an array. Unless we introduce one (`immutable` / `constant` / `fixed` arrays), Why3 always needs the `mutable` keyword.

@axic When I translate a `mapping (address => X)` (in Solidity) into an `array X` (in Why3), the length of the array can be fixed at `2 ** 160`.

I realized I didn't mention the `mapping` thing in the description.  I updated it.

@pirapira well in that case, regular arrays should have the upper limit of `uint256` `(2 ** 256)`.

@axic If we do that, Why3 will not check out-of-bounds access for regular arrays.  For regular arrays, I want to keep the same array length in Solidity and in Why3.

@pirapira do you maintain the length field in a similar way as in the EVM bytecode?

@axic I think yes.  A Why3 array maintains a length field before the array contents.  The array contents are by default declared mutable, but the length field is not.

@pirapira yes, actually we do have fixed arrays, where the length is defined upfront and is immutable. I wonder if the Why3 code works properly for dynamic arrays too (where the length field is mutable)?

@axic Yes, in Why3, if you say `mutable arr : array byte`, the length of `arr` can be changed during execution.  If you drop `mutable` and say  `arr : array byte`, the length is fixed, but the array content can still be changed during execution.

Currently array types like `uint []` cannot be translated into WhyML, so I created #1054 about it.

memory arrays (the only ones implemented for why3) cannot change their lengths in solidity after they have been constructed.

storage arrays cannot be translated to why3 yet.

Thank you for the information.

Why3 will be removed, so closing this.
