Since `this` is 0 in the constructor, there's little point using it. It should be a straight error condition.

`this` is the address of the contract, it is usable, especially to set up callbacks. We should report an error if someone attempts to call a function of the contract being created, but there is an issue for that.

True, even with the new address generation it should be available upfront.

The warning issue is this: #583.
