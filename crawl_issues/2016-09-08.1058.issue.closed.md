# [\#1058 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1058) `closed`: Trying to modify constant variables should have a better error message

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-09-08 10:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1058):

```
contract A {
    uint constant x = 1;
    function A() {
        x = 2;
    }
}
```

will result in

```
Untitled4:4:9: Error: Expression has to be an lvalue.
        x = 2;
        ^
```

This could be improved to state the reason.
