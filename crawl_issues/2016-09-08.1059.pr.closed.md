# [\#1059 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1059) `closed`: formal verification: Move the `invariant { ... }` clause to the `type account` declaration

Before this commit, when an invariant is specified for a contract, the invariant was copied to the declaration of `external_call` function that models reentrancy.  Unfortunately, WhyML function declarations do not take `invariant` keyword.  This caused a syntax error in Why3 (#1054).

After this PR, the invariant specification moves to `type account` that keeps the whole state of the account, including the storage and the balance.

This PR fixes #1054 .

The failing test is for mining timeout.

The initial proposal was to use `invariant`, but it did not work out. You have to use `ensures` at the contract level and then the `ensures` also has to be added to `external_call`, otherwise it is useless.

There is an open issue about making sure that contract-level conditions are transitive, this is actually what has to be checked (invariant is also too restrictive).

`invariant` on the `type state` works as can be seen in the handwritten [WhyML](https://github.com/pirapira/token_why3/blob/34cbdd14bdcd8f827facb86cc76b71874305aeba/why3-by-hand/token.mlw#L168).

The invariant is then enforced on all functions that modify `state`.  Also it is enforced in a nice way, allowing the functions to break the invariant temporally in the middle of functions.

So this means we should move contract-level annotations like `/// @why3 invariant` as a suffix of the state type and `/// @why3 ensures` as a condition of the external call function. If we can do everything with only invariants, I'm also fine with that.

And then, I realized this organization would anyway change in #1064 . So, I close this.
