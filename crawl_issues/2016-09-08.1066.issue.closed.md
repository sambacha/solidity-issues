# [\#1066 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1066) `closed`: formal verification: allow write access to mapping[idx]

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44281?u=19789513178700ad73a6cf535a40fbbfdc1ad615&v=4" width="50">[pirapira](https://github.com/pirapira) opened issue at [2016-09-08 14:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1066):

After PRs #1045, #1047 and #1063, when a Solidity program writes into a mapping by index notation, --formal option fails. This issue keeps track of translating the mapping access in a reasonable way so that it works on the following example.

Example:

```
$ cat index_write.sol 
contract IndexAccess
{
        mapping (address => uint256) balance;

        function write(address _addr)
        {
                balance[_addr] = 4;
        }
}
$ ./build-develop/solc/solc --formal index_access.sol 
index_access.sol:7:10: Error: Index access only supported for arrays.
                return balance[_addr];
                       ^------------^
```

This is working in a [branch](https://github.com/pirapira/solidity/tree/token_head), but the PR for this will not appear until #1045 and so on is merged.

I'm not following this path personally.  Removing my assignment.

I think those stories can all be closed.
