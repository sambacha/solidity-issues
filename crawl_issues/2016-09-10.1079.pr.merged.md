# [\#1079 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1079) `merged`: Solidity helper function for testing fixed points

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7756785?u=2893ea91743ac89ee3846d1f5c7209720e834129&v=4" width="50">[VoR0220](https://github.com/VoR0220) opened issue at [2016-09-10 02:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1079):

One issue on this PR: As you will see in the upcoming PR, there is a test that will fail involving a passing in of a fixed point argument. Do we need to do something about getting the signature of a (u)fixed parameter? Shouldn't it be simply aliased to u256? (I believe that this is the problem)

I think that would be useful, to have`ufixed(M,N)` in the tests for clarity.

@VoR0220 @chriseth can we finish and merge this?

@axic not yet. We need to get the inputs working properly. The outputs work. Just can't seem to figure out why the inputs won't take.

Inputs? Outputs? Are you sure we're talking about the same PR? :)

Yes, we are. So, when checking against the output, this fixed function works, but when trying to send arguments into the function call, this fails. I still don't know why this is.

@VoR0220 please explain what is not working in this pull request

@chriseth @axic So here is the problem in a nutshell. And it's a simple one. 

This does not work:

`BOOST_CHECK(callContractFunction("f(fixed,fixed)", u256(fixed(1, 3, 128)), u256(fixed(1, 2, 128))) == encodeArgs(fixed(1, 3, 128), fixed(1, 2, 128)));`

But this does:

`BOOST_CHECK(callContractFunction("f()") == encodeArgs(fixed(1, 32, 128)));`

I think that before merging this, the top should be confirmed working. I can't seem to get the top function to pass in the encoded fixed argument. Any and all suggestions are more than welcome.

@VoR0220 have you tried a simple one:

`BOOST_CHECK(callContractFunction("f(uint256)", u256(fixed(1, 32, 128)) == encodeArgs(u256(fixed(1, 32, 128))));`

where `function f(uint256 a) returns (uint) { return a; }`?

@axic no I haven't...but still...shouldn't it be set to the signature of fixed? Am I completely wrong here? I think as a hack this could work, but I really think this should be correct all out....I can try that approach though (and I bet it will work), but still...

@VoR0220 I think the point of this PR is not to implement `fixed`, but to add the helper method. I wouldn't be worried if those signatures are not working yet?

I suppose you're right. If @chriseth agrees, lets get this merged up.

@VoR0220 sorry for hijacking this pull request, but I really think we should keep this uniform.

I think the make_pair is a horrible syntax C++ has, but since there's nothing better and the overloading matches the rest, it should be better this way.
