This will probably fail in the portion where we try to pass in an argument. I reference this in the brother issue #1079 . Going to tack on the operators in the next PR.

Seems like all tests are failing with something similar:

```

@axic So I've rebased and come to this conclusion...fundamentally these boolean tests will not work due to the way binary operations are structured and the way fixed points are determined for implicit conversion. We COULD change the way binary expressions work for fixed points but something tells me @chriseth would not prefer this route. We could also instead run an explicit conversion to the same type (since they search for a common type between them) and this could be doable. The other option is that we use smaller types and have them convert from there. Would love to hear some input and requests for clarification as I'm sure this paragraph could use some.

@VoR0220 can you push your rebase?

@axic !!! I figured out why my function signature was screwing up! I wasn't implementing it fully. Was sending in `fixed` when I should have been sending in `fixed128x128`. Also I fixed boolean tests.

@chriseth @axic this one is all fixed up. Some of the suggestions that I had tried out I had to switch back to the old way because it didn't work for reasons I'm unsure of (minor simplifications). Either way. Happy this part is out of the way. Now I just need to update the addition PR, figure out how to get multiplication knocked out and this baby will be good to merge.

@axic added the changelog entry and the assert in the other fixed point operations PR.

Rebased.

We should first have a quick chat about decimal fractions.

@chriseth when is a good time for you to talk about it?

I attended @VoR0220 and @chriseth's chat about this.  The agreement seemed like a word `0xff` represents `25.5` when we have one decimal point.  This pull-request seems needing a change.
