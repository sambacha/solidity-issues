# [\#1081 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1081) `closed`: Fixed point operations

This contains all operations EXCEPT for multiplication and exponentiation (which have been marked as unusable for the time being). I think it would be best to view this as the last to merge if anything (fix up #1079 and make sure #1080 passes) then merge this in. In the meantime, work will be continued on the multiplication assembly.

For the same reason as #1080, this pull-request seems to need changing.
