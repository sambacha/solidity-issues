# [\#1082 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1082) `closed`: Fixed point multiplication

This is the last and probably hardest piece of the puzzle. Currently, if we were to uncomment the opcodes, it does indeed work. However...it is not optimizable in terms of the multiplication in its current state, hence why we are looking to turn it into inline assembly and feed it to the compiler (I may be wrong, but I think this will be the first feature to do that). Furthermore we are running into problems that tend to naturally occur in fixed points, that being that they lose resolution the larger and larger you make them. This could also do for some help in terms of helping to design a rounding system to try to get as much accuracy as possible when multiplying fractional fields larger than 128.

I'm beginning to think that either (or both)

a) Inline assembly is too immature at this point to make this happen
b) The difficulty of this will be greatly reduced with shift operations

So far I am having great difficulty reproducing what I've already gotten working with pure opcodes in normal assembly, mostly because I cannot retain as fine of control on the operations.

For the same reason as #1080, this pull-request seems to need changing.
