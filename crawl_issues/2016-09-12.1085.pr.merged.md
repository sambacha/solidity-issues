Added steps to obtain solidity dependencies in CentOS. Tested those steps
on a CentOS 6.8 machine, but the instructions are from memory. May need
some tweaking.

OK - Because of my broken permissions, I cannot merge.

Other than the HTTPS issue which @chriseth mentions above, it looks good to me.

No doubt we will be iterating on this many times in the future (CentOS 7 support), copying to cpp-ethereum and augmenting with the extra packages, etc.    Also looking at how RHEL fits into this picture.

But it's a great starting point - thanks, Lefteris.

Sorry, but I don't really think this looks good. This script severely modifies the system environment. Changing the global compiler version is a big deal. It also adds external repositories and uninstalls packages - something I would not expect from such a script. We should at least put a warning at the beginning and ask for consent.

I can do that. But the fact is if you have Centos, there is no other way to compile solidity. CentOS is a very different system.

Same with ArchLinux or most of the other distros. Linux users don't just run scripts randomly. We install packages. If there is no package we simply build from source.

I think this script can much better serve as a good guide of how to install dependencies on each system.

Yes, the script is just intended to codify the steps required to build Solidity (or cpp-ethereum in this script's other form) on a given distro.    If horrible hacks are required, then we should at least all being running the same form of those hacks.

So yeah, I think the warning up-front is good in cases where something really nasty is required, but not really for anything which is just updating your packages, building some of them from source, etc.

Thanks, @LefterisJP.    I cannot merge because of a permissions issue, so will need to wait on @chriseth to approve and merge.

@chriseth Do the "Required" tags above reflect some "branch protection" which you have just enabled for this repo?

@bobsummerwill yes, I increased the branch protection, but somehow appveyor does not report back, will force-merge.
