# [\#1088 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1088) `closed`: docs/conf.py should get the version from `../CMakeList.txt`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44281?u=19789513178700ad73a6cf535a40fbbfdc1ad615&v=4" width="50">[pirapira](https://github.com/pirapira) opened issue at [2016-09-12 20:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1088):

The file `docs/conf.py` contains a hardcoded version used to version the documentation. As this is an actual python file, it should be possible to extract the version number from the file `CMakeLists.txt` with a simple regular expression. Better yet, it could even create the full semver version string which is constructed in the following way:

VER is the PROJECT_VERSION string found in the CMakeLists.txt file.

If the root source directory contains an empty file called `prerelease.txt`, the version only consists of "VER".

Otherwise, the version is VER plus a suffix appended after a `-`. This suffix is either the contents of the file (if the file exists) or `nightly.<year>.<month>.<day>` (where the date components do not have leading zeros).
