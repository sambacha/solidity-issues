I cannot even merge PRs or commit, let alone access Settings (though I don't think I need to do anything with keys which would required that access right now).    Might be needed for PPAs, though.

Yep.   @chriseth had a quick look, and tried to add me manually, but it didn't help.

My issue is **only** for the solidity repo, as far as I can see.    You, @axic?

@bobsummerwill well I cannot merge anything now (not that I did that before), and occasionally I cannot even add labels or push to PRs.

Just for this one repo, right?   `evmjit` works just fine for you?

`evmjit`, `browser-solidity`, `solc-js` seem to work.

@bobsummerwill is this fixed?

I can't tell, because the Merge button on all the PRs for Solidity is greyed out because of the new protected-branch "automation must pass" blocker.   I don't have an override option.

So ... I don't know, because there is nothing in a state where I am would have the option to merge.

If any of the Solidity PRs get to the stage where they go green, I will check there.
