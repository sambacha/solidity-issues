This is a script that takes the ABI and generates contract interfaces from it:

This should be useful as a standalone commandline tool and as a "refactoring tool" inside browser-solidity.

@chriseth I tested the script, and it seems to still work and be valid, might be nice in the long run to break this out into a repo with basic docs etc. In the meantime, I'll create a PR.
