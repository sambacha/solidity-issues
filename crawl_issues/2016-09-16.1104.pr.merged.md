# [\#1104 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1104) `merged`: Fix memory resize costs during call

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-09-16 10:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1104):

If the output size of a call is larger than the input size, we have to pay for the memory resize as part of the call opcode. If we want to send all gas along with the call, we have to subtract the exact costs of the call opcode from the current gas value. As this is a quite complex calculation (and we also have to take the cost of the calculation itself into account), this is currently not done. Instead, we resize the memory before the call.

A tricky part in this change is to make the resize in a way that is not removed by the optimized.

Fixes #1083
