# [\#1119 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1119) `closed`: Inline assembly: rename non-function-style instructions to upper case

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-09-26 03:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1119):

Right now it can get confusing to mix both styles of instructions. I think it makes sense keeping function-style instructions lower case (with parentheses), while having non-function-style instructions match the usual assembly representation (i.e. uppercase only).

```
assembly {
  let a := add(3, 2)
}
```

```
assembly {
  3
  2
  ADD
}
```

What is the problem you are trying to solve here? functional-style and instruction-style opcodes can already be easily distinguished by the parentheses. It might be that there is a more fundamental problem below that you are trying to tackle.

The problem was making a harsh distinction between `Instruction` and `FunctionalInstruction` (now `FunctionCall`).

With recent changes, such as replacing instructions with builtins in Julia this can be considered sorted.
