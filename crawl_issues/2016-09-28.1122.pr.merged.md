# [\#1122 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1122) `merged`: Functions as first-class types.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-09-28 17:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1122):

This adds function types to the types available to the user. There are internal and external functions, the former of which cannot be used in external function calls (one of the reasons is that it would not be possible to evaluate them).

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/910, #1353.

Still to do:
- [x] documentation
- [x] discussion if this is the syntax we want
- [x] discussion if `internal` should be the default for function types
- [x] discussion if that is the encoding we want (left aligned `<function id><address>`)
- [x] special case in parser for function types for storage variables (distinguish from fallback function)
- [x] storing function types in storage (and tests for that)
- [x] arrays of functions (also in external function calls)
- [x] squash the commits
- [x] check that delete works on function types (in storage and on stack)
- [x] internal functions should survive the transition from constructor to runtime context in storage.
- [x] zero value for storage function should throw (for internal function, this is a problem because zero is actually a valid jumpdest) solution: invert the value (better than e.g. adding 1 because it can be equally applied to construction and runtime value)
- [x] modify the grammar file
- [x] use new proper ABI type for functions

This PR already provides basic functionality, you can pass along internal functions in internal function calls and evaluate them and you can pass along external functions in external function calls.

One suggestion concerning notation: TypeScript would use `(uint, uint) => (uint)` for a function type. It would not be too obvious where to place the `external` / `internal` keyword, but it would be much shorter.

agreed with the above suggestion as it also makes it more readable and able to discern which function is the "root" function and which are the parameters or in scope functions.

I think we should come up with a better way of representing this, maybe requiring parentheses around could work: `(function(uint) external returns (uint)) x`

I think `function eval(function(uint) external => (uint) x, uint a) returns (uint) {` would be better....the arrow makes it much more readable...perhaps some enforcement by the compiler that function types go at the end of the args? Or at the very least put that in the style guide...

@VoR0220 ,  @chriseth and I were discussing if the keywords `external` `internal` `pure` or `view` should come before/after the arrow `=>`.  Things before the arrow should talk about the input, and things after the arrow should talk about the output, but `external` talks about neither.  Maybe `external` and `internal` should come before `function`, so:

```
function eval(external function(uint) => (uint) x, uint a) returns (uint) {
              ^^^^^^^^
```

`(function())` and `(function()) x`

I don't think it looks that horrible. (Could be better.) The aim is to have the same syntax as current function definitions.

> so I would not force the requirement.

Even if it is not enforced, but is accepted by the parser, it could go into the style guide.

I like this as a future change, which applies to actual function definitions too. However, where do you put `payable`, `view`, `pure` and the modifiers?

@axic `payable` `view` and `pure` can be in the same position as `external` `internal` i.e. before `function`.  I doubt we should include general modifiers in the type of functions.

I'm thinking about using the same notation (whatever we come up with) for both declarations and variables.

@pirapira sorry, the quote was misleading. I don't think modifiers apply to function types. However I would like to use the same notation in general (with the exception that modifiers, `public` and `private` are not valid for types).

In the meantime, I assume that we at least settled for the basic notation for function types with the option to also introduce a short notation in the future. I also think that the default value of "internal" for function types is fine.

During testing, I found an unfortunate situation I would like to get opinions on:

```
contract c {
  function (uint) internal returns (uint) x = a;
  function a(uint) internal returns (uint) { return 2; }
}
```

The assignment `x=a` will be done at construction time, but the value of the identifier `a` is different at construction time than it is at runtime (because the code is different). I don't see a real language-based solution that this problem, so we should find a way to access internal functions at construction time that are also valid at runtime. We know which of the internal functions are accessed, so it might make sense to create a "trampoline" at a fixed point which has a special flag so it will not be moved by the optimizer.

@chriseth you can use `CODESIZE - 100` to access the same function at the construction time and at runtime in a uniform way.

@pirapira proposed to represent internal functions as a pair of `(construction_time_label, runtime_label)`. Both can be limited to 4 bytes. If a function is accessed at runtime, it is fine to leave hte first part as zero. If it is accessed at construction time, both are filled. If a function is called at runtime, the upper bits are zeroed out, if it is called at construction time, the lower bits are zeroed out.

Will we also add conversion from `function` type to `address` since that seems natural? A recipient of a function type could decide not to call it if it refers to a third party address for example.

One shortcoming I see is a limitation we have in the ABI in general: return types are not part of the signature. I would like that to be addressed in the future.

This reminds me: it should be right aligned (left padded) to support conversion by masking (and not shifting).

That would also change its output type from `bytes24` to `uint192`.

@axic the main reason I changed it to `bytes24` was that it is much closer to a `bytes24` than it is to `uint192`. Furthermore, conversion by masking does not help much, you always have to shift, too.

As an example, if it is right aligned: `Test(0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c).confirm(bytes32)` becomes: `00000000797af627ca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c`.

Typecasting that to `address` (`uint160`) should gives us the address.

Simple typecasting to address is exactly one danger I would like to avoid. How the higher order bits are handled for address is unspecified, so if you pass an external function to a function that assumes an address, it will perform the conversion without warning and just ignore the function signature part.

Discussion about the ABI resulted in:
- we will use `<address><function id>` (left aligned) as encoding type, potentially using the zero bytes after that as runtime type information at a later point in time
- the ABI type will be `function` (new type name). We do not encode the parameter types because the ABI is only used to disambiguate overloaded functions and specify the encoding. Encoding the full type information of the function is too detailed - we also do not do that for a lot of other things (Contract, for example).
