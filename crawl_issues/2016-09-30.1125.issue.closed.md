# [\#1125 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1125) `closed`: fuzz test the compiler

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-09-30 10:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1125):

Set up a server to continuously fuzz test the compiler with the goal to find crashes.

There are two kinds of crashes:
1. Actual crashes (segmentation fault and others)
2. internal compiler errors

For the second kind, it is hard to find "unanticipated" crashes because some internal compiler errors correctly signal non-implemented features. We might split this exception class into two different classes in the future to be able to detect "real" errors.

Very similar project [CSmith](https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/).

Some months ago I was running `solc` under American Fuzzy Lop, but didn't find a crash back then.

I think this should be done in any case.

I am using libfuzzer (from the llvm project) manually now and it detects quite a lot of crashes. The problem is that it exits for the first crash, not sure if that is intended use.

Yes that is the intended use.

I am running an AFL-fuzz now, found it pretty straight-forward to set up. 

Build and install AFL 

```
[~/tools/afl/afl-2.35b]
#make
[~/tools/afl/afl-2.35b]
#sudo make install
```

Instrument the solidity source:

```
[~/workspace/solidity/build]
#cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=afl-g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=afl-gcc .. && make
```

Create a sample input file, and an output directory, then do fuzzing

```
#afl-fuzz -i /home/martin/workspace/solidity/testcases/input -o /home/martin/workspace/solidity/testcases/output /home/martin/workspace/solidity/build/solc/solc
```

It's running, no crashes yet.

@holiman we do not only want to detect segmentation faults but also InternalCompilerErrors. The problem with the latter is that this is still blocked by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1133

Furthermore, if you want to get better example input, you can use https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/isolateTests.py to extract the end to end test cases from the .cpp file.

Closing this as we have the necessary infrastructure in place now.
