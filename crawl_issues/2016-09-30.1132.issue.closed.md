# [\#1132 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1132) `closed`: Implement rotate (and define syntax)
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

(Split off #33.)

We have a well defined syntax for shifts (<< and >>), but not many languages define a syntax for rotation.

One simple approach is to use an inline function `rotate_left(value, n)`, where `n` is the number of bits to rotate. The type of `value` would determine the width for rotation.

Naming proposal:
- `rotate_left` and `rotate_right`
- `rotl` and `rotr`

Usual implementation in C: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2835469/how-to-perform-rotate-shift-in-c#answer-2835503

Any ideas for a better syntax?

I strongly disagree. The usual smart contract has no use for this and you can very easily write an internal function for a library to do this. The reason we included shifts was just that we already have operands for shifts and there is an accepted notation for them.

@chriseth I agree it is not used widely.

It could become a library function, but for that we really need inline functions. Internal still produces a jump. With jumps the overhead is just too big - consider the rotations part of internal loops of hashing functions. It is really suboptimal jumping out of the loop constantly.

I agree, and that is a job for the optimizer. It is for better to have this efficiency for all small snippets and not only manually optimize those we think are more or less widely used.

Depends on #1256 if we want to implement this as a library.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
