@cdetrio can you please rebase?

@cdetrio can we also have a test for this please?

@cdetrio as discussed, the test doesn't yet nicely fit into the testing infrastructure as the number of `SSTORE` depends on the runtime and the number of them must be counted. I think possible checking for gas usage is one way doing it:

```
BOOST_CHECK(m_gasUsed == x);
```

Or even checking for a range could be a way.

Sorry for taking so long on this, but I would actually propose to close it and rewrite these things in the new intermediate language. In order to make this PR proper, I think a distinction between byte arrays and other types should be made and I would actually prefer not to touch this code here.
