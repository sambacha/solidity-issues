# [\#1140 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1140) `closed`: Provide variable annotation to receive outside information whenever variable is accessed

This is a very vague idea, but its essence is to allow outside actors to provide additional information to be used together when storing / accessing a variable. This information is usually hard to compute on chain but easy to verify (array index to insert at, encrypted value, ...).

@chriseth can you expand on this a bit?

I think this is too vague. It was related to witnesses etc, i.e. finding an element in a sorted array.
