Yep - sensible interim step.

I think it is worth my while getting the macOS builds back in a healthy state for both cpp-ethereum and solidity (which will be the same fix).

While we can arguably afford to drop macOS for cpp-ethereum we certainly cannot do that for solidity, but the issues will be the same, so we might as well fix both, I think.   Ditto for getting Homebrew bottles back.
