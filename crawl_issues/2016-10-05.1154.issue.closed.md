# [\#1154 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1154) `closed`: Exception on overflow in signed->unsigned conversion

When a signed integer is converted to an unsigned integer of the same size, the negative numbers cannot be represented in the target type.  This is a form of overflow, and should throw an exception following the discussion in #796.

(Note: C treats "unsigned->signed" and "signed->unsigned" differently.  "signed->unsigned" is always defined while "unsigned->signed" is sometimes undefined.  I don't know the reason.)

Delegated back to #796.
