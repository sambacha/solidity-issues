# [\#1155 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1155) `merged`: Suggest correct version for pragma.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-10-05 09:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1155):

Previously, the _current_ version was suggested for a missing version pragma, which does not work if the current version is a prerelease.

I don't think this is fully compatible with the versioning behaviour we have described in the docs.

@axic not sure I understand, why do you think this is not compatible? It is just a suggestion, since the prerelease can include arbitrary changes, we should assume that people know what they are doing.

This is just to change the compiler so that it does not suggest a pragma that does not compile.

Not sure what is the best way, but as the prerelease could contain breaking changes, going back a version might be actually breaking the compilation.

The real fix would be for the compiler to know what was the last release and figure out an appropriate version based on that.

@axic the real fix would be to take the prerelease into account in the semver matcher, but I think this is a pretty well working workaround. You don't release source code that relies on features in prerelease versions anyway.

When the user is using a prerelease version, the user is developing a code for the next release, not the previous one.  The suggested previous version will stay in the user's code base, but the version is not the intended target.

What about prerelease compilers not giving this warning at all (if you feel unsafe, you can add a warning saying "this is a prerelease and the version pragmas are ignored")?

I would still check for version pragmas to be present and to match the current compiler version.
For prerelease compilers, we can remove the suggestion and perhaps even add a warning "Warning: You are using a prerelease compiler that might be unstable."

@axic what do you think?

This sounds like a good idea.
