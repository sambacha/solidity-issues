# [\#1157 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1157) `closed`: Rename assembly instruction suicide to selfdestruct

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-05 11:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1157):

Since EIP6 is accepted, it probably makes sense renaming the instruction internally in libevmasm.

This means any internal usage is affected as well as the _opcodes_ and _assembly_ output of Solidity.
