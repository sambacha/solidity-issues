# [\#1160 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1160) `closed`: Add workaround to support pop() in inline assembly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-05 12:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1160):

Fixes #1118.

I'm a bit torn whether we should have it this way or not.

I think it's clear what `pop()` means.

(Perhaps, we can even think about a generalization where `add(3)` adds 3 to the topmost stack element...?)

I'm leaning towards that we don't need this, because every functional instruction should be balanced. Either assigned or popped:

```
let a := div(1, 2)
let b = call(...)
pop(call(...)) // don't care about the return value
```

@axic That's a sane judgment.  (I saw strange behavior when I left stack elements after inline assembly....)  Close?

This change looks strange, why does pop need special handling? How is it different from `sstore(x,y)`? In the documentation, pop is marked by `*`, where sstore is marked by `-`, that should also be fixed.

I agree that we should not allow a non-zero number of items on the stack for functional style notation, but I would actually prefer to have an explicit `pop` in that case and create a warning if that is not the case.

Ok, it might be that I misunderstood the PR :-)

`pop()` should not be allowed, because it takes an argument. On the other hand, things like `pop(sload(2))` should be allowed, and also `2 sload pop`, but not `2 sload pop()`.

Nobody really wants this one.  I'm closing this.
