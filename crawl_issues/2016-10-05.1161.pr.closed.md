Reserve keyword for #1130.

I don't see much point in this pull request, it is actually quite dangerous and will stay open for some time.

Depends on how #1130 is implemented - do we allow contracts to overwrite the `assert` keyword/function.

Sorry, the comment was not referring to the pull request per se, but making the pull request at this point in time.

The documentation has a list of reserved keywords.  Please add `assert` there as well.

But `assert` is currently not a reserved keyword.

@chriseth This pull-request only changes the code but not the documentation.  The current status in `develop` is fine because neither the code nor the documentation says `assert` is reserved.  This pull-request is in a lesser state because only the code says `assert` is reserved while the documentation does not.

@pirapira oh I'm sorry, I did not see that this is a pull request, I thought it was just an issue. In this case, yes, the pull request should update the documentation and the code at the same time.

Closing this for the moment. Let us reopen when the time comes.
