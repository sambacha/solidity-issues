Weird bug. Base errors is a simple errors contract. What's interesting is in DefaultDocument. Owned is the standard owned contract. For whatever reason, the recently instantiated contract will not return the string with which was used to construct it. Any ideas why this might be? 

```
contract DocumentTest is BaseErrors {

    function testDocumentCreation() returns (string) {

        DefaultDocument doc1 = new DefaultDocument("doc1");

        if (doc1.getName() != "doc1") { return "Doc1 name not set."; }

        if (doc1.getNumberOfVersions() != 0) { return "There should be no versions for a freshly created document."; }
        return "success";
    }
}
```

```
contract DefaultDocument is BaseErrors, Owned {

    string name;

    function DefaultDocument(string _name) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        name = _name;
    }

    function getName() returns (string) {
        return name;
    }

}
```

This produces the error 

```
DocumentTest.sol:12:13: Error: Operator != not compatible with types inaccessible dynamic type and literal_string "doc1"
        if (doc1.getName() != "doc1") { return "Doc1 name not set."; }
```

The error message is a bit convoluted, but the core issue is that you cannot compare strings :)

@VoR0220 it is a feature as opposed to a bug.

I'm not sure why basic support strings is not included in the base language.

I echo your sentiment here.
