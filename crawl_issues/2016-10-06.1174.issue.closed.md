# [\#1174 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1174) `closed`: Inline assembly: throw keyword or ErrorTag as a jump label (new feature)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-06 20:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1174):

Option 1: introduce a new keyword, which is a jump to the errortag:

```
assembly {
  throw
}
```

Option 2: expose the `ErrorTag` as a jump label to inline assembly:

```
assembly {
  jump(ErrorTag)
}
```

`define throw() { jump(invalidLabel) }`

As we will have functions soon, this can be closed. Inline assembly should have as few built-in features as possible to remain as flexible as possible.
