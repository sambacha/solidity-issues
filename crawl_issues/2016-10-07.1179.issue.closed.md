# [\#1179 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1179) `closed`: Assembly output: use ;; to separate comments

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-07 12:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1179):

Current assembly output:

```
    PUSH1 0x60      contract A {...
    PUSH1 0x40      contract A {...
    MSTORE          contract A {...
    CALLDATASIZE            contract A {...
    ISZERO          contract A {...
    PUSH [tag1]     contract A {...
    JUMPI           contract A {...
    PUSH1 0x0       contract A {...
    CALLDATALOAD            contract A {...
    PUSH29 0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000      contract A {...
```

Proposed:

```
    PUSH1 0x60      ;; contract A {...
    PUSH1 0x40      ;; contract A {...
    MSTORE          ;; contract A {...
    CALLDATASIZE            ;; contract A {...
    ISZERO          ;; contract A {...
    PUSH [tag1]     ;; contract A {...
    JUMPI           ;; contract A {...
    PUSH1 0x0       ;; contract A {...
    CALLDATALOAD            ;; contract A {...
    PUSH29 0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000      ;; contract A {...
```

It should help potential parsers to skip the comments.

This output is neither standardized nor made to being parsed. Furthermore, tabs / spaces are enough to separate the "instructions" from the comments.

@chriseth It is not yet, but this could be a good, painless first step at that.
