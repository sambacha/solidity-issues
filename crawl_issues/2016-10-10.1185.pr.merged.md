Should we also include a link to the unofficial peg.js: https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-parser/blob/master/solidity.pegjs?

I think we should move grammar.txt into the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html

@chriseth the python one to me seems (based on the comments in the file) to be kept as a regular file and copied into the documentation through a build script.

@axic the python file is used by the parser, but I actually don't see a single reason why `grammar.txt` should be its own file for solidity.

As long as it can be placed in a `<pre>` which still allows it to be copy pasted without changes I'm fine. However I do not see a problem having it as a link only as in this PR.

`grammar.txt` is the only part of the documentation that is not part of the documentation.

The move of `grammar.txt` is tracked in #1206.

The addition of the link is currently a good change.

`grammar.txt` is now at: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/grammar.txt

The grammar is actually inlined in the documentation.
