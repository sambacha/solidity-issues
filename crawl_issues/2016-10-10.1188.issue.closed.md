# [\#1188 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1188) `closed`: LLL: support symbols in the LIT keyword

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102482?v=4" width="50">[zigguratt](https://github.com/zigguratt) opened issue at [2016-10-10 13:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1188):

The `lit` keyword works as expected when used inline:

```
(sha3 0x00 (lit 0x00 "Initialized(bool)"))
```

As with any LLL keyword, `lit` should be usable in a macro:

```
(def 'keccak (input)
  (sha3 0x00 (lit 0x00 input)))
```

However, when the `keccak` macro is subsequently invoked:

```
(keccak "Initialized(bool)")
```

the compiler produces this error:

```
Parse error.

Is it happening in every case or certain cases only? Do you need some help tracking it down?

The error happens in all cases where `lit` is executed in a `def` and a string literal is expected. I haven't tested other input types. The `lit` [docs](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/LLL-PoC-6/04fae9e627ac84d771faddcf60098ad09230ab58#literals--code) describe three possible input literal types. This fails in a `def` macro because I believe the `lit` handler doesn't expect the type of input provided to it by `def`. 

I'm not yet familiar enough with the `liblll` C++ source to be able to follow the trail effectively so yes, help tracking it down would be greatly appreciated. The `lit` handler is at line [274](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/liblll/CodeFragment.cpp#L274) of `CodeFragment.cpp`, and `def` is at line [225](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/liblll/CodeFragment.cpp#L225). I'll continue to try to figure it out as well.

Thanks, @axic!

I would normally look through the assembly code produced by the compiler to see what `lit` is getting, but the error prevents the assembly code from being generated.

A quick update: I just tested the other two types of input to `lit` in a macro and they both fail in the same way. So it's not specific to string literals.

Actually, I'd like to try to figure this out myself for a bit longer. There's no huge hurry and it would be good for me to get more familiar with the code anyway. I appreciate the offer of help and I'll probably take you up on it in the near future.

Thanks again, @axic!

It's not looking good for being able to fix this bug. @axic and I have looked in-depth at the `lit` code in the compiler. Having to look up symbols at compile time is a problem because, according to @axic, "the whole compiler works on the assumption that everything is evaluated runtime and no instructions are there to be evaluated an compile time".

That makes sense. Sadly, it introduces a situation where a legitimate LLL keyword can't be used in a macro because in that context it gets a symbol as input, which would require a compile-time evaluation.
