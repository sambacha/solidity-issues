1. accepted external identifiers
   `identifiers (externals, labels or assembly-local variables), e.g. jump(name), 3 x add` should explain that functions and libraries can also be pushed to the stack.
2. mention that `assembly "evmasm" { }` is a valid syntax
3. at the end of the assembly block, the stack should be balanced (unless intentionally required otherwise)

I don't want to mention 2 until we have a second value for that string and 3 is already done, right?

I don't think any of this is documented, but there's a warning for 3.

Hey, current documentation says that you can access external function in inline assembly, can you add some examples?

Sorry, but I fear this is being phased out.
