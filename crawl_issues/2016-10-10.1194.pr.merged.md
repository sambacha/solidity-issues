# [\#1194 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1194) `merged`: Proper type checking for bound functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-10 23:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1194):

Fixes #561 and #1216.

The reason this is becoming increasingly complex is that when a `FunctionType` is bound, `parameterTypes()`, `parameterNames()`, etc. will skip the first argument without validation.

To me the changes made sense.

This was updated to refuse creating bound functions without a self type. This feels like the proper fix, with a downside: error reporting is negatively impacted.
