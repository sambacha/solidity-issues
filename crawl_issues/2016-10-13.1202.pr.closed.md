Thanks for the pull request! We are actually planning to make a big overhaul of the json output. We'll think about whether it makes sense to include this at this point - especially given that you can see from the error description whether it is an error or a warning.

Ah, got it, thanks. The reason I wanted this is that when I use it as a library, it felt wrong to find warnings by looking for "Warning:", especially since we have a rich output mechanism.
