# [\#1205 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1205) `closed`: Fix the documentation around the inline assembly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44281?u=19789513178700ad73a6cf535a40fbbfdc1ad615&v=4" width="50">[pirapira](https://github.com/pirapira) opened issue at [2016-10-13 14:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1205):

In `./docs/control-structures.rst`, there is a table of mnemonics available in the inline assembly.
- `pop` is marked `*` for no good reasons
- `sload` is marked `-` though it pushes the result to the stack
- `pop` should be `pop(x)` and the description should be updated.

There's already an issue for inline assembly: #1190.

Yes, the titles look very similar.  Now I can close this one because its contents are already captured in #1217.
