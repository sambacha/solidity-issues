# [\#1210 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1210) `closed`: doc: making the index appear in the table-of-contents in the top page
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`, `easy difficulty`

The rST source of the documentation contains some indexing related tags like `index::` or `:ref:`, but I don't see the resulting index [online](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/index.html) on the left pane of the web pages.  This issue keeps track of adding a link to the index on the left pane of these pages.

An index exists at http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/genindex.html, but it is hard to find it.

Please make sure that this does not only works locally or in the CI but also on readthedocs (they have a slightly different way of compiling the documentation, it seems).
