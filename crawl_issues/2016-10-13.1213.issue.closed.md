# [\#1213 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1213) `closed`: doc: clarify the scope of `using A for B`
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`

```
The using A for B; directive is active for the current scope, which is limited to a contract for now but will be lifted to the global scope later, so that by including a module, its data types including library functions are available without having to add further code.
```
- How big is "the current scope"?  It can be understood from the document that not all `{ ... }` pairs delimit the scopes.  Also, it can be understood that a function forms a scope.  I guess a contract forms a scope as well.  In this case for `using A for B` directive, it is unclear to me if "the current scope" can be a function scope.
- "will be lifted to the global scope later", does this happen after a planned feature of Solidity is implemented, or just later in this document?

`using a for b` can only be used at the contract level (i.e. inside contracts but outside functions) for now. It is a planned feature to make it available everywhere. Currently, `var` scopes are functions and contracts, but we plan to also add let-scopes which are all `{` `}` pairs. I think it makes sense to apply the scoping rules for `using A for B` to let-scopes.

**1) [mikro2nd](https://gitcoin.co/profile/mikro2nd) has started work.**

Having looked through the issue on github, along with the clarification provided by @chriseth, I'm confident I can reword the relevant section in contracts.rst to reflect current reality and planned changes. In my experience with developing tutorials and teaching material it is best to *omit* mention of future plans completely and stick only to the current facts. (The docs will naturally have to be upgraded when the software changes, but that's a yagni for now) but please do give guidance on whether you feel the planned upgrade /should/  be discussed or not.

Enough: this note is already longer than the text needed!
