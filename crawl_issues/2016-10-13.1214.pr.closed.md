# [\#1214 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1214) `closed`: doc: remove "prior to Homestead" descriptions

In the documentation there were two sidenotes about "prior to Homestead" era.   I think these notes are no longer necessary.

The other change is just a clarification about when the function overload resolution is performed.

If we get #1117 implemented, this may become useful?

After #1117, in my opinion, EVM version differences should be explained in a special section about the differences.  The other parts of the documentation can always talk about the "current" one.

I think we should still leave that in, people might ask about old rules and opcodes.

I thought these phrases are leftovers from the era when people remembered things before Homestead, but from the comments here, I guess that's not the case.

My main concern was about undefined names like "Homestead" appearing in the middle of a text.
