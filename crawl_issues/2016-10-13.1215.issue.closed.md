# [\#1215 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1215) `closed`: Allow multiple events with the same name (aka event overloading)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/824194?v=4" width="50">[pipermerriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam) opened issue at [2016-10-13 16:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1215):

``` javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;


contract TestIt {
    event A();
    event A(uint i);
}
```

Trying to compile this contract produces the following error.

``` shell
$ solc tmp/EventTest.sol --bin
tmp/EventTest.sol:6:5: Error: Identifier already declared.
    event A(uint i);
    ^--------------^
The previous declaration is here: tmp/EventTest.sol:5:5:
    event A();
    ^--------^
```

While these two events share a name, their topics are different and I believe should be allowed (the same way that duplicate function names are allowed as long as their argument types differ).

Solidity properly encodes the signature whether the argument is present or not, so it should definitely work.

Is this still working in 0.5.0? I seem to be getting some errors related to this, where the wrong overloaded event is being emitted... ðŸ¤”

@mrdavey please create a new issue with example code.
