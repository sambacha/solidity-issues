Do you mean the warning produced would be invalid in that case? Because as above, warnings are not treated as errors anymore, so it should compile.

Ok, actually we need a way to modify the deposit from within inline assembly. The problem is that this value for deposit is used for the code that follows the inline assembly code. If it is wrong, then access to local variables is broken.

As a medium-term solution, let's always put this warning but perhaps add a comment that jumps may cause the value of deposit to be incorrect which also means that local variables access and other things will be broken in the code that follows the inline assembly.
