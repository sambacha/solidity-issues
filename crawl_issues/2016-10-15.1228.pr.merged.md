# [\#1228 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1228) `merged`: LLL: move broken parsing of Ethereum subunits to macros

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-15 13:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1228):

Fixes #1197.

This is a breaking change. Current parser zealously will replace all `<number> szabo` occurences (even replacing `1 szabounit` with `1000000000000 unit`).

The new syntax with macros is `(* 1 szabo)`.

Damn. Meant to approve only one of the commits. Didn't know it was going to approve both at once.

Please check that this does not break any of the tests in https://github.com/ethereum/tests

I don't see anywhere LLL is being used in the tests. Do you have any pointers?

@chriseth thanks. I did a search on the repos for `wei`, `szabo`, `finney`, `ether` without any results.
