# [\#1237 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1237) `closed`: Resolving overloaded functions with implicitly convertible parameters

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6081701?u=1f6e1161dba35bee194be50da9203e3c56ac4d66&v=4" width="50">[codywatts](https://github.com/codywatts) opened issue at [2016-10-16 20:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1237):

Given the following Solidity code:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.2;

contract OverloadedFunctionTest
{
    function overloadedFunction(bytes16 input) public constant returns(bool)
    {
        return true;
    }

    function overloadedFunction(bytes32 input) public constant returns(address)
    {
        return address(0x0);
    }
}
```

The following calls to `overloadedFunction` produce these compiler errors:

```
// Error: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
overloadedFunction("hello world");
```

This error was expected, as it's ambiguous how the literal string `"hello world"` should converted.

```
// Error: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
overloadedFunction(bytes16("hello world"));
```

This error was somewhat unexpected, because I am being explicit about the type I am passing in. But `bytes16` is still implicitly convertible to `bytes32`, so I can see how there may still be room for ambiguity.

```
// Error: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
bool returnValue = overloadedFunction(bytes16("hello world"));
```

This error surprised me, because between the assignment and the explicit input, I expected that Solidity would have enough contextual information to deduce what function I was calling.

This code was tested using the online Solidity compiler, version `0.4.3-nightly.2016.10.12+commit.def3f3ea.Emscripten.clang`.

@codywatts nice catch!

(As the return parameters are not part of the ABI, I would assume they are not part of the internal overload resolution either.)

This is a missing planned feature I just copied from pivotal tracker: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1256

Closing as duplicate.
