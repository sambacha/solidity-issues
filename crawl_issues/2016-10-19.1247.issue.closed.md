# [\#1247 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1247) `closed`: Update gas costs in gas cost estimator

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-10-19 10:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1247):

The gas costs in the estimator do not reflect the latest hard fork changes. At best, it should be possible to select which "ruleset" to use for the estimation.

See #1117.

@pirapira would you like to do this task? We should provide an option to select which rules apply. For now, we do not need to expose that option to the commandline interface, instead, we just select the latest rules in effect in the real world.

OK.  I also noticed the `nextrelease` label.

This comes in two steps.
* [ ] update the gas table, without supporting multiple versions (this should solve the problems for the current users)
* [ ] support multiple versions of gas table
    * [ ] the test cases in `GasMeter.cpp` need to specify fee schedules

There are some tests that check the gas usage against cpp-ethereum, so I think with this story, we also have to update the cpp-ethereum we use as testing backend. We might want to switch to the docker image for that.

@chriseth I'll figure out what interface I need from `eth/eth`.

I just ran the tests for the pull request and there are failures, so it will be postponed for the next release.

Will be completed in #2220
