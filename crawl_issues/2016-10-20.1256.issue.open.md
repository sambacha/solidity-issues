Currently, functions are selected as overload candidates if all arguments can be implicitly converted to the expected types. If there is not exactly one candidate, resolution fails.
This makes it impossible to call different functions depending on whether one argument is a storage or a memory array, because storage arrays can be implicitly converted to both storage and memory arrays.
We should add a ranking of candidates depending on which conversions have to take place.
For this, a conversion from e.g. storage to memory should be "worse" than a widening of an integer type which in turn is worse than no conversion at all.

This is needed so much!

The case when there's an exact match with other convertible types should be fixed very soon. I've this problem `uint`s:

```
contract A {
  function a(uint32 x) {}
  function a(uint x) {}
  function b() {
    uint32 c = 1;
    a(c);
  }
}
```

Hi, I just encountered this issue and was wondering what the plan is for incorporating a fix?

We have to define the order of resolution for every possible conversion.

Just bumped into this issue, with `function foo(uint152 x)` and `function foo(address x)`.

Is this issue still unresolved?

I'll add it to 0.6.0.

What is the current thinking around this issue ?

I think this could be done in a non-breaking way (because after this change, I think more code compiles than before) - can someone please check?

My proposal for a simple implementation is: If there is a unique function where the argument types are equal (including storage location), use this one. Otherwise do overload resolution as we currently do it.

I have an idea. What if, instead of adding implicit rules on overload resolution we added a way to clarify the type of an argument?

My proposal would be to introduce a special conversion operator, let's call it `exact()`, that would make its argument not implicitly convertible to anything. Example:

```solidity
function foo(uint256 x) {}
function foo(uint32 x) {}
function foo(address x) {}
function foo(string memory x) {}
function foo(string storage x) {}

function test() {
    uint32 x;
    foo(exact(x));          // calls foo(uint32)
    foo(exact(uint(x)));    // calls foo(uint256)
    foo(x);                 // ERROR: ambiguous

    address a;
    foo(a);                 // calls foo(address) directly
    foo(payable(a));        // calls foo(address) through implicit conversion
    foo(exact(payable(a))); // ERROR: foo(payable) does not exist; implicit conversion to address not allowed

    string storage s;
    foo(s);                 // ERROR: ambiguous
    foo(exact(s));          // calls foo(string storage)

    // If we introduce the copyof operator:
    foo(copyof s);          // ERROR: ambiguous
    foo(exact(copyof s));   // calls foo(string memory)
    foo(exact(memory(s));   // calls foo(string memory) - possible alternative if we don't
}
```

The operator would affect the expression rather than "stick" to the value. When you copy/assign a value, it does not preserve the "exactness". I.e. after `uint32 y = exact(uint32(x))`, `y` is again implicitly convertible to `uint`.

Some alternative syntax ideas:
```solidity
foo(x, exact payable(a), y);
foo(x, exact<payable>(a), y);
foo(x, exact|payable(a)|, y);
foo(x, |payable(a)|, y);

foo(x, only(payable(a)), y);
foo(x, explicit(payable(a)), y);
foo(x, noconv(payable(a)), y);
foo(x, asIs(payable(a)), y);

// We could also allow making variables permanently exact:
address payable exact constant b;
foo(x, b, y);
```

I would actually say we can relax this even more radically.
Implicit conversions induce an ordering of types, e.g. ``uint8 < uint16 < uint64 < uint256``.
We can actually use this order for this.
So in
```
function f(uint64) {}
function f(uint256) {}
f(uint8(0));
```
we can just disregard ``f(uint256)``, since ``uint64`` is implicitly convertible to ``uint256`` and thereby ``uint64`` is strictly more specialized than ``uint256``.

So in general, if I have two overload choices ``f(A)`` and ``f(B)``, I can disregard ``f(B)`` exactly if ``A`` is implicitly convertible to ``B``, but ``B`` is not implicitly convertible to ``A``. That works even if the argument type that triggered the overload resolution is merely implicitly convertible to ``A``, but not identical to ``A``.

Chiming in to cast my support for this.

As I explained [here](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/no-unique-declaration-found-when-overloading-functions-with-integers-of-different-sizes/1308), I find it a bit confusing that the compiler cannot disambiguate between two functions `f(uint64)` and `f(uint256)`.

Overloading functions with different integer width is super common when writing tests with Foundry.

Just wanted to note that when solving this we should remember that integers are not the only case here. For example #13879 brought up a related case with function pointers.
