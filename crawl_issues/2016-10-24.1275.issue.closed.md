**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `optimizer`

This should have test cases written assembly, testing also the special codes for codesize, .data sections, etc.

Certain optimisations could be tested also, especially once #887 is implemented.

There already are some tests for the optimizer, but yes, the suite could be extended. The problem is that those tests are hard to get stable.

Peephole optimiser tests would be stable enough (assuming the tests address single optimisation cases and maybe some combined ones).

Indeed, but we do not have such an optimizer yet.

This was achieved, we do have tests for the optimiser, including the peephole. It can always be improved though.
