# [\#1288 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1288) `closed`: LLL: support the Serpent dialect of LLL

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-10-26 09:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1288):

The basic keywords supported Serpent are:
- `ref`
- `get`
- `set`
- `comment` - not supported here
- `ops` - not supported here (seems to be equivalent to `(asm ..)`)
- `lll`
- `with` - not supported here
- `seq`
- `unless` 
- `if`
- `until` - ~~not supported here~~ added by #1294
- `alloc`
- and every EVM assembly opcode - ~~not supported here~~

`with` defines a context where a variable is forced to be on the stack:

```
(with '__funid (div ...) (seq ...))
```

Where the variable called `__funid` will be on the stack, its value is defined by the first parameter, and the scope of its lifetime is the second parameter.

@zigguratt can any of the missing ones by implemented via a built-in?

At a glance, it doesn't look like any of the Serpent-only LLL keywords would be easily implemented in a built-in macro. We have:

```
comment
ops
with
until
```

`comment` doesn't seem very useful, IMHO. `ops` does look like it's an `asm` equivalent. From Serpent's `compiler.cpp` for `ops`:

```
// Custom operation sequence
// eg. (ops bytez id msize swap1 msize add 0 swap1 mstore) == alloc
```

That leaves `with` and `until`, I'm pretty sure `with` would need compiler support. `until` is the inverse of `while`, so we can probably treat it the same way in `CodeFragment.cpp` as `when`/`unless` - an easy and somewhat natural addition to the compiler.

Both `with` and `until` would be good additions to the language, I think.

the Solidity LLL compiler supports some EVM opcodes. Are there any missing?

EDIT: I found this in the old [POC 6 LLL documentation](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/LLL-PoC-6/04fae9e627ac84d771faddcf60098ad09230ab58#basic-syntax):

> All instructions of the EVM-code 1 spec are valid, though you generally shouldn't need to use the stack manipulation and jump operations.

`until` has now been added to the Solidity LLL compiler: #1294

Consider the merits of reviewing `clll` as well: https://github.com/drcode/clll

@zigguratt @benjaminion I think we could close this issue given Serpent is deprecated by its authors.

I agree. I haven't looked into it yet, but does Viper have an LLL dialect?

It had, but they've changed it from s-expressions.

Then we're good to go! I never liked that there were different dialects in the first place. At least we got `with` and `until` out of the exercise.

I'm fine for this to be closed.
