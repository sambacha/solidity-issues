- [ ] The dispatcher has to check through all ABI signatures. The later the requested method is in the list, the more it will cost.
- [ ] Mention the order of gas cost differences (~20 gas for each additional step - as of EIP150).
- [ ] The signatures are sorted by value
- [ ] Fallback, if present, gets to be first (special case)

Do we really want that deep level of documentation? Keep in mind that we have to keep it updated. Perhaps it would be better to tell people to look at the gas estimation for their functions. Furthermore, we should really use binary search for large contracts. And last but not least: Tell people that gas costs are subject to change with any hard fork and they should never rely on them.

The dispatched now has a binary search, if enough functions are present.

There has been other requests to sort it by state mutability or by a supplied list. Since this comes up rather frequently, I'd say it would make sense documenting it.

@chriseth @ChrisChinchilla what do you think?

Sounds good!

Sure, I will add it to the list, people like to know how things work :)

Since we have the binary search option, this question comes up ever so often, and we may change the dispatcher with new functionality (#11102), I think it makes sense to really document this.

[This is the codegen function generating the dispatcher.](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.3/libsolidity/codegen/ContractCompiler.cpp#L318)

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
