Due to the fact that every prerelease version of a compiler emits a warning for every input, the tests that check for the existing of some warning are now ineffective. We should change these tests to check the actual warning text.

This should be done for the errors too - we want to check for specific errors and not "it's fine if any error has happened".

@pirapira your PR only said "trying to fix". Do you want this to be reopened?

Yes.  The PR started to fix the problem in only one file.  I knew the comment would close the issue, but I was too optimistic.
