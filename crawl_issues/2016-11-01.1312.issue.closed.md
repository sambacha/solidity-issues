Moved from #1351:

> I was wondering if we should just perform cleanup on calldata inputs or throw in case of invalid data received?
>
> I see the most common use cases for invalid calldata being an attempt to exploit a bug as opposed to be for a genuine optimisation.

---

> > we really need to make sure that Solidity-generated external calls do not send garbage

> It would be really bad if it wouldn't be the case as compiler cannot assume the recipient is always a Solidity contract. By throwing on invalid input we could easily verify if any of our tests fail at least.

#1318 is related (for booleans only).
