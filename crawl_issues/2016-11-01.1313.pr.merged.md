Split out off #1298.

@zigguratt can you please review the changes?

The three changes are:
1. do not accept `0x` as 0, but require at least one digit
2. `()` requires at least one parameter
3. an invalid symbol will not be translated to `PUSH <stacksize>`

For 3. not even @zigguratt can recall the reason.

Need to verify the problems discovered in https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/3387.

The reason for 3. is that undefined variables become defined at first access and have a value.

`(for [i]:0 (< @i 10) [i](+ @i 1) [j](+ @i @j))`

The undefined variables `i` and `j` will become `0x80` and `0xA0` in the above snippet.

So 3 should be reverted?

I guess for now it should be reverted. A lot of old LLL code uses auto-defined variables, including the [POC-5 examples](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki/LLL-Examples-for-PoC-5/04fae9e627ac84d771faddcf60098ad09230ab58). But this dubious feature has pretty severe side effects: any typo will auto-assign a variable and no error will be produced. It makes debugging that much more difficult.

But I'll let @axic have the last word regarding reverting 3.

With regard to @axic's `for` loop example, it would require a simple `(def 'i 0x80) (def 'j 0xa0)` before the `for` loop and then auto-definition is unnecessary and the code becomes clearer.

We've discussed with @zigguratt that it define-on-use variables potentially cause more harm than benefit, even more so that they exist in the global context.

They can be simply replaced by `def` as written above. Eventually, we should support the `with` keyword from Serpent's LLL to define variables only valid for limited context.

Before merging this change, the cpp-ethereum tests need to be amended to use the def keyword.

@zigguratt can you please double check again this PR against all your LLL source codes?

@axic I'm out for the day today. I'll have to check tomorrow morning.

All of my current LLL source compiles on this branch. I think it's ok to go ahead and merge.

I think we should merge #1442 first.

@chriseth can this be merged? The cpp-ethereum change was merged.
