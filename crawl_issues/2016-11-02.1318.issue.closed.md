# [\#1318 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1318) `closed`: Convert boolean values to one bit

Currently when a boolean value is loaded from the storage, they are masked against 255 but this leaves 8 bits.  Boolean values should be truncated to one bit.

This has to happen
- before storing a boolean into storage (test added in #1381)
- before storing a boolean into the memory (test added in #1381)
- before being used as an event argument (test added in #1381).

I guess #1381 already adds these cleanups, so I'll add tests on top of it.
