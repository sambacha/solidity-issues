Might be trivial, but makes more sense to be able to directly return the name of the winner for the election. If the position of the winner on the proposal[] array is returned, then people still don't know the name of the person who won.

Removed all the duplicate code as suggested and simply called the winningProposal() function. Added some comments to help explain the function to new users. Thanks pirapira for the suggestions

@chriseth is there a particular reason why we do not allow returning structs?  Or shall I create an issue about that?

@pirapira there is an issue for this, but basically the capability currently does not exist due to the ABI needing to be defined for structs.

@pirapira Are there any further changes to be made by me before this can be merged? Or is the change too trivial for a merge with dev branch.

Thanks

@varunagarwal315 no, no, this was just a pause to hear people.
