This is still work in progress.

To me one natural way to write assembly is:
```
// JUMPI needs two arguments
failure, error_tag := JUMPI()

// ISZERO satisfies the need of 'failure' but produces the need of 'success'
success =: ISZERO(failure)

// CALL satisfies the need of 'success' but produces the need of its seven arguments
gas, to, value, in_offset, in_size, out_offset, out_size =: CALL(success)

// A constant '3000' satisfies the need of 'gas'
3000(gas)
offset =: calldata(to)
4(offset)

// 'dup' satisifies the need of two numbers and produces one need, which is satisfied by '0' 
0(dup(dup(in_offset, in_size), dup(out_size, out_offset)))
```

The bytecode generation is quite simple bottom to up.
I think here it makes sense to request explicit `swap`s.

I am working on a document here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Sk60_gVhav6ReOJdve6TheYvJlKU4n-IYqF-3az5Bo/edit

I'm not sure if the "reverse" way of e.g. call is easy to understand in your example.

The reverse example was for mind stretching. 

For formal verification, forward or reverse does not matter.  One thing that matters is the hidden DUP and SWAP instructions.  I will need explicit DUP and SWAP instructions in the interface language between Solidity and the theorem provers (otherwise I will be verifying the code before optimization; I need to verify the code after the optimization).

The current assembly language is a too thick abstraction for that purpose because local variables can be used many times in arbitrary ordering (then DUP or SWAP would be hidden).  I think I will need a thinner abstraction.  The thinner assembly would have no if-statements, and no for-loops.  The thinner assembly has macros but the macros arguments only represent immediate values in PUSH instructions.  Macros cannot be defined in macro bodies (to avoid scoping problems).

Local variables are acceptable but they can be used only once, and a newly defined local variable needs to be used sooner than older local variables.  At JUMPDEST, all possible control flows need the same sequence of local variables.  If this is not very useful, I would go without local variables.

But, if the assembly specification is clear enough, I might be willing to believe that the cpp implementation and the theorem provers interpret the assembly code in the same way.   So I will check the draft for ambiguity.

Addressed some comments and added new sections about switch, loops and functions.
