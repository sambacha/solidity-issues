@pirapira probably this could be fixed by #1334 easily?

On #1334, I added a test that sees `ActionChoices(-1)` throw an exception.

I'm actually concerned a bit why is the value different on those two cases above.

There was no cleanup for enums previously.

@axic The difference comes from storage access.  When an enum is stored into the storage, the value is truncated.

Oh right, that's storage. And enum's are stored as the shortest int type they fit in. I would argue the same should apply to when they are a variable in memory / stack.

@pirapira @chriseth Even though the sympton is fixed now by not allowing negative values, the cleanup isn't yet performed. I wonder if there's any other way to trigger the above after the latest changes. If there is, we should definitely perform the cleanup.

Let's keep this open till the doubt is gone.

When I remember what @chriseth was saying about cleanups, we need
- [x] cleanups before sending an enum value as external function argument (#1371)
- [x] cleanups before returning an enum value from a function (#1372)
- [ ] cleanups before enum equality comparison
- [ ] cleanups before storing an enum value into memory
- [ ] cleanups before using an enum value for looking up a mapping
- [ ] cleanups before using an enum value as an event argument
- [ ] cleanups before storing an enum value into storage.

Test cases would involve inserting invalid enum values using some inline assembly.  I think invalid values should cause exceptions.

Most of the items above are redundant because they involve copying the enum value to memory.

When #1381 is merged the remaining points should be solved.
