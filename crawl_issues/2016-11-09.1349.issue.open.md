Function types require quite a lot of keystrokes. The obvious shorthand is
`(uint) -> (uint)`, but our function types are more complicated than javascript's - we also need to specify internal / external, constant, payable (view, pure). Is there a good notation for these?

We could distinguish internal and external by `->` and `=>` and then something like this:

`(uint) [pure,payable]=> (uint)`

This seems like it adds complication without a lot of real value.
- Pros:
  - Fewer keystrokes
  - Function definitions get shorter
- Cons:
  - Anything that parses source code has to now account for this notation and the old.
  - Mental overhead.  People have to understand that there are two ways to define functions.

I think the mental overhead is actually reduced:
```js
library ArrayUtils {
  // internal functions can be used in internal library functions because
  // they will be part of the same code context
  function map(uint[] memory self, function (uint) returns (uint) f)
    returns (uint[] memory r)
  {
    r = new uint[](self.length);
    for (uint i = 0; i < self.length; i++) {
      r[i] = f(self[i]);
    }
  }
```
vs.
```js
library ArrayUtils {
  // internal functions can be used in internal library functions because
  // they will be part of the same code context
  function map(uint[] memory self, (uint) -> (uint) f)
    returns (uint[] memory r)
  {
    r = new uint[](self.length);
    for (uint i = 0; i < self.length; i++) {
      r[i] = f(self[i]);
    }
  }
```
and this is only a simple example, one of the more complex being
```js
contract C {
  function f3() internal returns (function() returns (function () returns (function () returns (uint))));
```
vs
```js
contract C {
  function f3() internal returns (() -> (() -> (() -> (uint))));
```
 

Note that this is ONLY about function types, not about function declarations.

I completely misunderstood the intent of this. Disregard my injections. I'm
+1 on this notation.

Staging this for 0.8.19, but as "discussion only" - we'll need to see if whatever we come up with is breaking or not and don't need it urgently, but we'll need this this year.

What's the reason this is needed?

The current function type syntax quickly becomes unreadable, which will especially be a problem once we'd allow compile-time constant expression evaluation and later generics, which is likely to make passing internal functions around more common. It's not crucial, but it's a good time for checking if we can find a nicer syntactic solution here.
