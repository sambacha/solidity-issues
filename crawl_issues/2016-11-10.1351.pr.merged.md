# [\#1351 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1351) `merged`: Truncate a boolean from calldata into one bit

When a boolean is loaded from the calldata, the value is truncated to one bit.

This fixes #1318 
Fixes #1312

After discussion with @chriseth, we realized `ISZERO ISZERO` behaves better than taking the least significant bit.  Double-`ISZERO` can be omitted before `JUMPI` but "taking the least significant bit" cannot.

I was wondering if we should just perform cleanup on calldata inputs or throw in case of invalid data received?

I see the most common use cases for invalid calldata being an attempt to exploit a bug as opposed to be for a genuine optimisation.

@axic I think it makes sense to be generous upon receiving data and be strict upon sending data.  If we throw here, we really need to make sure that Solidity-generated external calls do not send garbage.  Otherwise we risk Solidity contracts being unable to call other Solidity contracts.

On the other hand, generous transformation makes it a bit harder to search for a transaction from calldata.

It would be really bad if it wouldn't be the case as compiler cannot assume the recipient is always a Solidity contract. By throwing on invalid input we could easily verify if any of our tests fail at least.

I agree this change very likely a breaking change.

@axic If we choose double-`ISZERO` as the cleanup, we can omit the cleanup before `JUMPI`s because `JUMPI` treats all non-zero values in the same way.   If we choose to throw exceptions for invalid boolean values, we cannot omit the checks before `JUMPI`s.

The same point can be made for `AND` as well (for comparison `OR` is fine, because `OR` translates any invalid input into an invalid output, so we can defer the check).  This is the reason with which @chriseth convinced me to use double-`ISZERO` as the cleanup.

I think we should work on the documentation a bit as currently it feels like a journal paper excerpt. It is nice, but probably not the language intended for easy to read documentation :)

@axic I replaced the whole two paragraphs.

@pirapira can you add a test which takes a bool calldata and returns bool?

```
function test(bool in) returns (bool out) {
  out = in;
}
```

How can I rerun appveyor?  The errors there seem unrelated.

The test failure is about finding PPA

```
Cannot add PPA: 'ppa:ethereum/ethereum'.

Please check that the PPA name or format is correct.

Renamed the section to "cleanup" as opposed to "overflow".

@chriseth @pirapira are there any outstanding issues on this PR?

@pirapira my commut changing overflow to cleanup in the docs was removed. Is that intentional?
