Ok, there are some issues with `eth` installed from Homebrew, but not with the compiled `solc`. I will investigate further and see what can I do.

@federicobond since cpp-ethereum and solidity have their separate trees (and separate brews?) this shouldn't be a reason not to merge this?

@axic eth is installed together with solidity for testing

Can we merge this in yet? Or no?

Solidity compiles and runs tests just fine with macOS Sierra. `cpp-ethereum` installed via Homebrew still has problems, but you can use a precompiled binary easily.

I am happy to merge this change if others agree.
