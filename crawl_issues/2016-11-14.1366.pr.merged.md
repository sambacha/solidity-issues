LGTM mod assert <4k
Note that the hash will probably change with POC 0.4

Unfortunately this is the main problem with including Swarm/IPFS hashes in Solidity output.

@axic I think it is still fine, as long as it is the hash of _something_.

@axic This should now respect the strict specification.
@zeilig do you have any test vectors I could use?

I think this would belong into its own file (or common), but not in SHA3.

Sure, only so much we can do. Better to have some support now than no support at all.
