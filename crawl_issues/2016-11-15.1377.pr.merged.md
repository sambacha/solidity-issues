# [\#1377 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1377) `merged`: Keep internal results in JSON

Split out of #760.

The real benefit I can see is that we don't need to return stringified JSON's after the overhaul of the input/output JSON. We can just keep everything as an object and serialise once. By doing that, the compact vs. pretty print serialisation can be removed too.

The current PR doesn't change external behaviour though.
