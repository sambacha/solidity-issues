By the time the compiler is able to enforce `view` and `pure` modifiers, it should be possible to detect expressions without side-effects.   This issue proposes a warning for expression statements without side-effects.

For instance, there would be a warning on the statement `3;`
```
Warning: a statement without side-effects.
function f() { 3; }
               ^^
```

This should also catch the case of `var a = 0; a;`

This should also catch `msg;`.

This should also catch expressions that are not pure but reads states.

The `isPure` annotation on expression already goes into the right direction, but we can implement a little more, actually. We should add a `sideEffectFree` annotation that is true for e.g. referencing any variable (`isPure` is only true for constants).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
