# [\#1385 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1385) `closed`: Export keyword for creating contract modules

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7756785?u=2893ea91743ac89ee3846d1f5c7209720e834129&v=4" width="50">[VoR0220](https://github.com/VoR0220) opened issue at [2016-11-15 19:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1385):

This is something that is needed/highly desired for our efforts in package management. A simple keyword not unlike `using for` but instead made for exporting a package of contracts. What this keyword will do is drop all symbols that are not currently in an `export` field of the module being passed up through the compiler, so that names can be reused in packages further up the import tree.

What you can already do for now is importing some selected symbols from several other files into one file - similar to how this is generally handled in Python. Would that already help?

Not really. Atleast I don't think so based on how you're describing it. The thing is that file is still going to be passed up, symbols and all. 

Lets say I have a package, and inside this package are the contracts: 

```
contract A{}

contract B{}

contract C{}
```

These are fairly common names. Someone decides to use my package. They also want to create a package that might have fairly common names `contract A{}`. When we try to compile them, we will get a duplicate name error. To resolve this, I am proposing that we enable users to determine what is the main `module` of their contract package set that will be the main one for reuse. This can be defined either/or as such:

```
export C; //export contract C

//or 

export * for C; //exports all inherited symbols 

// or

export C as foo; //exports it under a different name

// or 

export * as foo; //exports all symbols in file under the name foo
```

This could probably use some brainstorming but I think the idea is fairly clear now of what I'm trying to get at.

I think this is a sensible suggestion. It also sounds similar to ES6 methodologies for handling modules, or am i mistaken? https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export

@VoR0220 Let's say you have the following file x.sol:
```
contract A{}

contract B{}

contract C{}
```

You can use `import "x.sol" as X;` which will only create the symbol `X` and you can access the contrats via `X.A`, `X.B`, etc.
You can also choose to only import some symbols from `x.sol` directly:
`import {A, B} from "x.sol";`

Interesting. Okay. I think that solves my problems.
