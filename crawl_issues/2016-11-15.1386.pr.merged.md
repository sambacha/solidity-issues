# [\#1386 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1386) `merged`: Metadata stamp

This PR adds a swarm hash of the compilation metadata (which also includes swarm hashes for the source files) to the runtime bytecode of each contract.

Fixes #611.

I think the settings part is so much Solidity specific that either we should move them under a `solidity` node or remove the `language` node.

Concerning the layout of the settings option: Of course it is solidity specific. The keys that are not solidity specific are `version`, `language` and some parts of `output`. The specification would say that `settings` is optional, but if it is present, its structure depends on the language. Also the `compiler` key is language-specific, but I don't see a reason to introduce an extra hierarchy level for the language-specific parts.

The `compiler` key is used to retrieve a compiler for source verification. Combined with `settings` it is possible to reproduce the compilation process.

We might want to move `compilationTarget` (which is also solidity-specific) into `settings`, but it is probably better for it to be a bit more prominent.

Are there any other items we want to include?

The idea here is that we include everything that is required for recompiling and also some things that are useful without recompiling.

I did not include the source mappings and the AST for example, because if you want to use that, you usually also have a compiler to just re-generate them.

Agreed to use `userdoc` and `devdoc` instead of `natspec`

Proposal: add magic number that specifies the encoding of the metadata hash. Options include `bzzr0` - should ask swarm people about how they want to version their hash. We could also cbor-encode the magic number and the hash.

@axic CBOR encoding of `["bzzr","abtttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhtttttttttttc"]` and `{"bzzr","abtttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhtttttttttttc"}` both need 40 bytes, so 4 bytes more than the actual payload. The problem with cbor is also that we need to find the start of the cbor encoding - not sure if that is doable at all. So I think we have to find our own modified encoding anyway.

If we want to stay flexible, I see some options:

 - reverse CBOR
 - last byte is length (where values larger than 127 are reselved), up to that, cbor encoded
 - last byte is length (...), up to that magic-number prefix plus data

That is a valid concern and I would agree the easiest is to leave a trailing fixed-length size field. I would argue to make it 16 bit wide.

Regarding the actual CBOR content I was thinking about an array, starting with a flag byte (integer):
- bit 0 could mean "Swarm hash of metadata"
- bit 1 could mean "keccak256 hash of metadata"

As discussed, a good solution currently seems to:
- place CBOR encoded data immediately following the bytecode
- use a CBOR hashmap
- the `bzzr0` key has the current Swarm hash as the value
- the CBOR is followed by a 16 bit big endian length field, representing the total size of the CBOR encoded data, excluding this length field

Result of investigation on my local machine: I can reproduce the test failure with clang, but if I compile the contract manually with optimization with clang and gcc, I get the same result.
This could mean that the bug is in the test framework.

Since a `STOP` is emitted before the aux data, should we mention that in the hash description? e.g. the CBOR data should be preceded by `0`.

Concerning the STOP: We cannot rely on the fact that there is no other data before the metadata cbor.
