@chriseth @VoR0220 @pirapira we should have another call to clarify the remaining points. Anyone free tomorrow?

(Also postponed updating this until #1386 is merged as it replaces some parts.)

Rebased to include the new metadata description.

I think the input source list should support the same `urls` field which is present in the metadata. The urls then can be copied over to the metadata too.

The way the import callback works is for each source entry, try to retrieve the url  in sorted order, and stop when one of them returns successfully. If all them fail, the file is not found.
