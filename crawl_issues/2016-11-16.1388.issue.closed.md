Hi,

I tried installing solidity on FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE-p2, after installing all dependencies by hand with the commands [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html).
I get the error : 
```[  7%] Built target jsoncpp-project
[  7%] Built target solidity_BuildInfo.h
[  8%] Building CXX object libdevcore/CMakeFiles/soldevcore.dir/CommonData.cpp.o
c++: error: argument unused during compilation: '-fuse-ld=gold'

@louisabraham is this still a problem?

I don't know, since it did not worked with BSD and it was a critical requirement, I installed Arch and pacman did the job perfectly :)

On FreeBSD I get the following error when trying to compile solidity:
```
libevmasm/Instruction.h:102:2: error: expected identifier
        MSIZE,                          ///< get the size of active memory
        ^
/usr/include/sys/param.h:166:16: note: expanded from macro 'MSIZE'
#define MSIZE           256             /* size of an mbuf */
```

Seems like `MSIZE` is already defined somewhere else.
