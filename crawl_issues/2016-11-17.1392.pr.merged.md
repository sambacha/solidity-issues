I would propose to use macros in the actual tests (so that the boost failure references the correct line) which check: error type, error message.

Please also check that there is exactly one warning / exactly one error. If we have tests that report multiple errors, we might be able to fix them - if not, we can add another option to the macro.

@chriseth "exactly one error" is split out to #1412 because this involves fixing 33 tests.

@chriseth @axic I think this one is ready now.

Looks great! We should also add expected error texts in a later PR wherever it fits.
