# [\#1394 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1394) `merged`: styleguide: Order of Functions

Ordering would help readers identify which functions they can call, and to find the "specials" (constructor and fallback function).  Mixing the "specials" in the middle of the code, as well as internal functions between external and public functions, don't help readers

Based on ConsenSys/MultiSigWallet#19

Looks good to me. Any other opinions?

Also can you please double check that the contracts in the `std` directory all satisfy the new style guide? They should be kept up to date with the style guide changes.

Actually, the contracts in `std` raise a good question: where to place modifiers, events, state variables? Probably we need a new section for "contract layout".

@axic is this fine to be merged for now?

Thanks, I checked contracts in std and they are currently fine (eg they basically all just use the `public` default)

>  where to place modifiers, events, state variables? Probably we need a new section for "contract layout".

We can do this in another (additional) PR.  I'll propose the order should be 1) events  2) state variables 3) modifiers
