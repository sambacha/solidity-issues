# [\#1397 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1397) `merged`: Error out when contracts collide on name

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614752?u=1565826f2b2d74054639e6500236b073aa10f81a&v=4" width="50">[roadriverrail](https://github.com/roadriverrail) opened issue at [2016-11-18 15:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1397):

The previous behavior, courtesy of the [] operator in std::map, would
uncritically store a new ContractDefinition in m_contracts even when a
ContractDefinition already existed.  This "resolved" collissions on contract
names by clobbering the original one with the new one, and could lead to
scenarios where the clobber would only be discovered when the original
ContractDefinition could not be found or referred to, which was an unhelpful
InternalCompilerError.

This change checks the m_contracts map for a collision first and will not let
the ContractDefinition be changed to a new one once it's set, throwing a
CompilerError with information about the conflict.

Fixes issue #1120

Some things to consider before merging--
1) This "breaks" four tests.  Two of them are broken because there appears to be a presumption that CompilerStack::compile() will casually return a boolean showing if the code will compile or not.  To show good error messages, I throw a CompilerError, which means that, for two of these tests, we're "passing" but by throwing an exception and not by returning false.  This should be an easy thing to correct.

2) At least one of the other two tests broken by this change are broken because the test presumes that libraries and contracts don't collide when they have the same name.  I'm not sure if this is really desirable behavior.  See also conversation on issue #1120

The planned proper fix would be to disambiguate such cases through the file name - this should also help in the case of libraries. Do you think that this would fix all the cases you have seen?

Could you explain in more detail what you mean by "disambiguate such cases through the file name"?  Maybe offer a small example?

If you want to refer to a contract, you should be able to do it by `FileName:ContractName`. Contracts and libraries with the same name should only be disallowed in the same file.

Did a stylistic cleanup and incorporated all the proposed changes, with the exception of the ones from @chriseth regarding my guard code to prevent double-adding a contract in CompilerStack.cpp (see conversation above).

I'm also going to fix up the tests so they use fully qualified names for looking up contracts.

I coded up the library stuff already and it feels right to be in this PR.
I also think I made the library clash test case a hair more useful.  Will
push in a few minutes.

Apologies on the delay; transition in my day job to blame.  Fixed the most critical parts of this.  Will look at the query process tomorrow to add a fallback like you asked.

No worries! Do you still plan to make it backwards-compatible?

I'm not a huge fan of having fallback behaviors like that, but I'm going to
do it.  There isn't really a query "function" being used in those places.
It's really just hash lookup, so I wanted to refactor the code into a
function.  That's when I also noticed it looks like there's a function in
CompilerStack called contract( ) that might already do this sort of thing,
so I just needed a little more peeking in on doing it right.

Rebased, added, the fallback, and reverted the changes to the tests.  I'm not super stoked about the fallback, mostly because somone may have really meant "A:B," but the lookup is for just "B," and the lookup could return "C:B" instead.  Again, though, that might live in a world of theory that exists mostly in my head.

Nice, thanks a lot! There are some tiny things, which I will just do after merging
