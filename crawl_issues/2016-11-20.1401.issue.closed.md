Related to #719, #973, #708.  Grouping the examples here.

These behaviours can be confusing for people who are starting out with the language.  Solidity has been criticized as a language that hasn't been designed with safety in mind, and this is one feature where safety was overlooked imo.

```
contract Example {
    uint n = 2;

    function test() constant returns (uint n) {
        return n; // Will return 0
    }
}
```

And another:
```
contract Example {
    uint n = 2;

    function test() constant returns (uint n) {
        n = 1;
        return n; // Will return 1
    }
}
```

One more:
```
contract Example {
    uint n = 2;
    uint x = 3;

    function test() constant returns (uint x) {
        uint n = 4;
        return n+x; // Will return 4
    }
}
```

A case where the explicit return statement is "overshadowed" by the named return.

    function foo() returns (uint r) {
        r = 1;
        if (somethingComplexThatReturnsFalse()) {
            return 2;
        }
    }

Instead of `somethingComplexThatReturnsFalse` imagine a bunch of other code and loops.

I've always really liked the named returns feature of Solidity. If anything `return` should be changed to not be able to take a value.

I would love to see us drop named returns altogether. I think it improves code readability to be explicit about returns.

We already have https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/973#issuecomment-261755730 for the first three examples. I think named returns in general are a great idea for readability - it will tell the user the meaning of the return value.

 - If you are talking about being able to assign to the return value, this is a different topic. 
 - If you are talking about being able to use a non-explicit return in a function returning a value, it is also a different topic.

For readability, can the meaning of the return value be expressed as a code comment?

"being able to assign to the return value" is that this example?
```
function foo() returns (uint r) {
    r = 1;
    if (somethingComplexThatReturnsFalse()) {
        return 2;
    }
}
```
Or is the example a case of "non-explicit return in a function returning a value"?


Here's another "bad" one (0 will be returned):
```
function foo() returns (uint r) {
    if (somethingComplexThatReturnsTrue()) {
        return;
    }
    r = 1;
}
```

The "named" returns feature is another quirky one that gets burdened on Solidity writers and reviewers to get correct.

```
contract C {
    address[] public authorities;

    function foo() constant returns(uint count) {
        count = 2;
        return authorities.length;  // "Overrides" the "named" return. returns 0, the default for all EVM values
    }

}
```
```
contract C {
    address[] public authorities;

    function foo() constant returns(uint count) {
       return;  // return 0. It can appear that the default value (of 0) is returned.
    }

}
```
```
contract C {
    address[] public authorities;

    function foo() constant returns(uint count) {
        count = 2;
        return;  // returns 2. Here return doesn't return the default value (of 0) but acts like a "break".
    }

}
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
