# [\#1423 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1423) `closed`: Compile from source failing

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/824194?v=4" width="50">[pipermerriam](https://github.com/pipermerriam) opened issue at [2016-11-23 02:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1423):

I'm running into an error when compiling from source.

The error occurs during execution of the `./scripts/install_deps.sh` script.

* Error: https://travis-ci.org/pipermerriam/py-solc/jobs/178072066#L1583
* Full Script being used to build: https://github.com/pipermerriam/py-solc/blob/9caabbc9debfe744848df1b834a99228706b8053/bin/install_solc-0.4.6.sh

This has been working for all previous released versions down to `0.3.6`

```
 CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (include):
  include could not find load file:
    deps/jsoncpp.cmake
```

You need to ensure the `deps` submodule is properly updated.

I'm pulling the source from the zip file from the releases on github so I'm
not working in a repository. Is this potentially something that is missing
from the script that is supposed to install all dependencies?

Yes, please only compile using git. The zip auto-generated by github does not work because it does not contain the submodule, and there is no way to modify the generation to include submodules.

The hash matching the newly signed file is incorrect. Per alpine problems.
