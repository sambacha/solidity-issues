# [\#1436 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1436) `closed`: segmentation fault on self-referential constant
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following input causes a segmentation fault in `solc`.

```
contract C {
  uint constant x = x;
  function f() returns (uint) {
     return x;
  }
}
```

Circular references also cause a segmentation fault:
````
contract C {
  uint constant x = y;
  uint constant y = x;
  function f() returns (uint) {
     return x;
  }
}
````

The crash is triggered by an infinite recursion in the `ExpressionCompiler::appendVariable` method, which causes a stack overflow.

@federicobond thank you for digging down.  I'm thinking of keeping track of the set of "currently being expanded constants" so that we can catch this.

Is there a standard solution for solving this problem in compilers? It's a pretty common case so I assume there is a tried-and-tested method somewhere.

I just tested self-referential and circular non-constant state variable declarations and the compiler accepts and compiles the code without throwing an error. I have no idea what the output means, though.
