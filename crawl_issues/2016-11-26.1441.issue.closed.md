# [\#1441 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1441) `closed`: Shouldn't using `now` to define a constant variable fail at compile time?

Doing this:
```
uint public constant expiration = now + 10 days;
```
works and makes `expiration == 10 days`. This was confusing to me. Would it be better if `solc` failed and said something like "Can't use `now` to define constant variable"?.

No because at run time is when `now` would be defined.

Aren't `constant` variables defined at compile time?

not currently...currently they are not enforced by the compiler (there's an issue discussing what to do with `constant` in the future [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/992))
