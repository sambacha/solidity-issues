# [\#1451 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1451) `merged`: Accept any kind of whitespace after natspec tags

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1658405?v=4" width="50">[LefterisJP](https://github.com/LefterisJP) opened issue at [2016-11-30 14:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1451):

If you added two spaces after `@param` then the compilation failed since it could not properly parse the param name. Fixed that particular parsing error and also made it resistant to either tabs or spaces.

Fine apart from test failures.

Test seem to fail only for clang. Will take a look a bit later and try to fix it.

Any progress on this? :-)

@axic @chriseth Done. Apologies for the delay.

Is it possible to include tests for the failure cases?

@LefterisJP:

> The failure cases?

For example this one: `appendError("End of param name not found" `

@axic Added tests for the failure cases touched by this PR. A better natspec error checking system where we can actually compare the error message emitted with the one we think we are causing would also be nice but perhaps part of a different overhaul/PR.

Agreed, added #1617. As long as we include tests for everything this PR touches that should be good.

@axic Thanks for making the issue! Seems like a low-hanging fruit .. may touch it at some point :)
