This PR strengthens an assertion so that it makes sure that a pointer is not null.
Moreover, `isLocalVariable(variable)` is now positively asserted, following the error message.

This was found by the Clang Static Analyzer.

Can you add a test for this?

Yes, now I'm on it.

It turns out it's hard (or impossible) to touch this case.  State variables are removed from the scope already.  So it's hard to make `isLocalVariable` false.

There was a test case for this already, and I've specified the expected error message.
