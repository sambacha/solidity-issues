@chriseth I moved everything to a new `StaticAnalyzer`. I have a couple of questions:

 * Static analyzer works on each separate contract right now, just like the type checker. Perhaps it's more useful to run it on the whole source, like the SyntaxChecker, but after all contracts have been typechecked.
 * I haven't pushed any tests yet, but I am working on them. I wanted to get feedback on the code as early as possible.

Thanks!

I added the tests in `SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp` because it had the right helper functions and macros for asserting presence and absence of warnings, but we should either rename it or split the tests and move the common code to another file.
