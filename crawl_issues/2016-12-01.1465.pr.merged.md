# [\#1465 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1465) `merged`: document missing keywords

I added `null` and `default` as reserved keywords.  I added `assembly` in `grammar.txt` together with the inline assembly grammar.

This fixes #1403.

I think we should only declare the syntax for assembly instructions, i.e. keywords and parenthesis.

Having the list there opens up a bigger problem when we have macros available in inline assembly - do we need to define every single one of them in the grammar?

@axic I have a secret plan of following these definitions to generate inline assembly code randomly.  For macros I would just say `Identifier` followed by some arguments.

The instructions aren't different from that though.

@axic That's a fair point.  I searched for `send` `call` and `deletetecall` but these don't get special treatments in `grammar.txt` either.  I'll just say `Identifier` followed by parameter list.

@axic done.

It must be noted though there three exceptions in our parser: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/inlineasm/AsmParser.cpp#L156

`return`, `byte`, `address` is parsed as a keyword and not as an identifier as it needs to be amended for inline assembly.

@axic `grammar.txt` does not exclude keywords from the possible identifier.

I think it is quite normal that a grammar specification does not explicitly specify that the use of keywords as an identifier is not allowed.
