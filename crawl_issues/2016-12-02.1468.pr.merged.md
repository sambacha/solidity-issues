# [\#1468 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1468) `merged`: Implement memcpy without the identity precompile

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-12-02 09:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1468):

Fixes #1248.

However, it costs more than the identity, so I'm not sure it should be turned on.

See a testing toolkit: https://gist.github.com/axic/3746cb1228ced4345ae882d8ec9773b9

< 32 bytes:
Identity: 1011gas
Assembly: 1001gas
Solidity: 1021gas

194 bytes:
Identity: 1762 gas
Assembly: 2262 gas
Solidity: 2324 gas

Very likely we'd better off having memcpy and memcpy32, the latter only copies <= 32 bytes, and use them appropriately where we know the limits.

Yes, makes sense (memcopy and memcpy32), most of the time, we should know whether it is a multiple of 32.

@chriseth is `appendInlineAssembly` doing local variable cleanup (popping)? It seems like it doesn't.

It only removes locals you define as part of the inline assembly. Variables that you reference externally have to be popped manually, so you have to append `m_context << Instruction::POP` three times. Any other way would trigger a warning / error. The macros feature will of course fix that.

I've realised this since after debugging. Meanwhile added a lot of useful code to aid using `appendInlineAssembly`.

Working on this now.

This is ready for review.

The new implementation uses 173 gas to copy 64 bytes and 644 gas to copy 210 bytes, which is around 3 gas per byte. The precompile uses 3 gas per word, but has an initial cost of at least 900.

I'm not requesting changes actually, I just canceled the approval so that I can continue reviewing.

I guess my review would finish in five hours: (number of items in my queue till the point everything related #1468 is related /  my usual speed of consuming my queue) = `18 / 4 (/h)`.

I added checkboxes on my requests.
