`CompilerUtils::memoryCopy()` is used for copying arrays (string, bytes, arrays, etc.)

Currently it uses the identity precompile to accomplish this (it might change, see #1248), but it won't check if the actual call succeeded: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp#L315

Shouldn't it throw if it couldn't copy?

The only way it might fail is due to gas problems. Let's just remove it.

And if it is run on chain without the precompile.
