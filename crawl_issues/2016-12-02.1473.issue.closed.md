# [\#1473 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1473) `closed`: docker build is not automatically triggered

docker hub https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/solc/ does not automatically generate a new build on a push to develop. This might  be due to the way I created the repository. We have to find someone with admin permissions for the ethereum org on docker hub to fix this.

I think this was fixed by #1616.
