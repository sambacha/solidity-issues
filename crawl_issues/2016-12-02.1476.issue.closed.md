The preferred way is to use `keccak256` instead of `sha3` and `suicide` was renamed to `selfdestruct` by an EIP.

Could you make `sha3` a reserved word that no one could use?
Otherwise, one could fool others with a call to dummy `sha3` implementation.

We should probably just warn about these.

I think it may be better to start issuing warnings instead to avoid the problem of libraries starting to define those functions.

If we're just issuing deprecation warnings for calling these functions, put it on my queue.
