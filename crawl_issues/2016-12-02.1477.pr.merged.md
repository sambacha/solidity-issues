There is a pending pull request to make it work, so I would not remove it from the documentation.

That sounds fine, but let me maintain zero tolerance against inconsistencies (this means I take a note whenever I notice differences between the documentation and the implementation).

The removed paragraphs assume the binary representation, so these paragraphs will be wrong when the fixed point types are implemented.

Since the fixed point PRs were closed, is there any timeline in getting them done?

Meanwhile, since we have a couple of places in the documentation mentioning fixed point types, I think we could either:
a) remove all references
b) keep all references, but with a comment / warning stating they are not supported yet

The existing descriptions assume the binary representation.  The implementation is going to be decimal.  So I guess "a) removing all references" causes less confusion.
