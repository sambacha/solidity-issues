# [\#1490 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1490) `merged`: Option to show messages in tests.

If you use `soltest -- --show-messages` it will print the call and return data of each transaction during testing.

Restarted the tests, but they've failed in different locations in each of the three runs under clang (under gcc it worked):
```
/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp(5180): error in "return_multiple_strings_of_various_sizes": check callContractFunction("s1()") == encodeArgs(0x20) + dyn1 failed

/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp(1131): error in "structs": check callContractFunction("check()") == encodeArgs(true) failed

/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/test/contracts/Wallet.cpp(598): fatal error in "revoke_addOwner": critical check callContractFunction("isOwner(address)", h256(0x33)) == encodeArgs(false) failed
```

Do we potentially have some bug with clang build?

@axic are you sure this is not a problem in the backend? Do you get "mining" errors?

There were no mining errors this time. `eth` has its own problems as frequently there are mining errors or "Account not found".

Just tried clang-3.5, but I did not get any failures.

Merging since I cannot reproduce the errors you mentioned. Also note that travis has a clang run which is also passing.

It was failing on travis as you see the logs above, I've restarted it after it failed.
