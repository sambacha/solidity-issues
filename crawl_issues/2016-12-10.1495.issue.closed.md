I am not sure I understood the question, but if you access the name of a memory array variable in inline assembly, the memory position of that variable is "returned". Note that the data in memory starts with the length of the array (one word, 32 bytes) and then only the actual data starts.

In general, such questions are much better suited for ethereum.stackexchange.org - this is only an issue tracker. Because of that, I will close this issue.
