# [\#1512 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1512) `closed`: Metadata - decide/document sorting/ordering of fields

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-12-14 16:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1512):

The ordering of the fields in the metadata output should be deterministic for each compiler version as it should reproduce the same output file.

We need to test/review and ensure that it is definitely the case.

(Pulled from #1508.)

jsoncpp sorts keys in objects alphabetically. Are you talking about that?
