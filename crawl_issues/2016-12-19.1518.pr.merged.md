# [\#1518 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1518) `merged`: Corrected explanation of recursive contract creation

"now possible" should instead read "not possible."

Nope. That's definitely correct phrasing.

Recommend closing.

Then maybe the rest of the sentence could be clearer. "now" is only relevant from a historical perspective, but can only be understood with historical information that is not present. And I don't understand how the second part follows from the first. The first clause introduces a constraint and the second negates a different constraint — what is the relationship there? I was thinking of the case of mutual recursion: if the code of B must be known to instantiate it, and B precedes A, then A can make a new B, but B cannot make a new A unless there is special code in the compiler to tie the knot, right?

What the docs are saying is that in order for you to create a new instance of a contract from within a contract, that creating contract has to be aware of the source code of the instance of the contract you are trying to create.

Ah, I see. According to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html: "If a contract wants to create another contract, the source code (and the binary) of the created contract has to be known to the creator. This means that cyclic creation dependencies are impossible." This matches what you just wrote in the comment. I've revised the patch accordingly.

I don't know why this restriction still exists, but for now the following code does not compile.

```
contract C {
  function f(){
    new D();
  }
}

contract D {
   function d() {
     new C();
  }
}
```

@pirapira: interesting. I see this code also does not compile:

```
contract D {
   function d() {
     new D();
  }
}
```

@mcoblenz confirmed.  Now I don't know what are the "recursive" contract creation which is possible.

@pirapira @VoR0220 So was my initial suggestion the right one?

Yes, it was.
