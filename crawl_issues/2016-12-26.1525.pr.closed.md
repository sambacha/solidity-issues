# [\#1525 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1525) `closed`: Remappings reference and fixes

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7756785?u=2893ea91743ac89ee3846d1f5c7209720e834129&v=4" width="50">[VoR0220](https://github.com/VoR0220) opened issue at [2016-12-26 22:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1525):

This provides something of an upgrade to remappings. It resolves problems laid out in #1520 . 

WHAT DOES IT DO?:

Remappings now come with a reference handler ('@') that will allow you to resolve context in a far easier way by referencing a previous remapping. 

Example: 

`solc foo=/usr/Foo/ @foo:bar=/usr/Bar-1.0/ main.sol` is the same as 
`solc foo=/usr/Foo/ /usr/Foo/:bar=/usr/Bar-1.0/ main.sol`. 

Furthermore, the previous version of remappings did not do a good job checking to make sure that we were getting the exact context we were looking for. For instance, if I passed in a global remapping of `foo=/usr/Foo-1.0` but also passed in a context clue for a certain module, it would default to the global no matter what. This resolves that.

Let me know if there are any concerns (please before the winter's end).

I don't understand the comment by @chriseth in issue #1520.  Does this PR already take [that comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1520#issuecomment-268972832) into account?

@pirapira yes the PR takes @chriseth s comment into account.

Definitely need to add another test tho...fully agree there.

And the source definitely is a useful clarification.

This is a useful feature for the user interface, but I think it unnecessarily complicates the internal functionality. I would like to hold off on this until we have the json interface. If you use automated tools (like package managers), those will generate the remappings for you anyway, so the only benefit is that the list of remappings will be shorter, but it is not necessary for the package manager. Is that correct?

Well...no...it actually is very necessary for a default remapping to a module remapping. Id argue that the current functionality contains a bug whereby if you define a global remapping it overwrites all module remappings which makes package management design an absolute and utter pain.
