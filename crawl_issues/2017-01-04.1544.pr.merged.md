This begins redoing the type resolution to prepare for a decimal type.

Will this PR only including changing the current `decimalBits` to `decimalDigits`? If so, what is left to do?

It needs some cleanup at least.

@VoR0220 will you have some time to look into this?

I will try to change this PR so that the type information is changed to decimals but will not cause any danger.

If the tests pass, this should be ready to merge in its current state. I just brought this pull request into a state where it does not cause any harm to the compiler. Documentation and lexer are not updated.

@axic this is ready from my side (windows CI cannot turn green on this branch).

Will this PR update the following?
- documentation (the types section is currently empty)
- ABI
- `docs/grammar.txt`
- `docs/utils/SolidityLexer.py`

No, this is not about completing the feature, it is about getting this dangling PR into a state where it can be merged and closed so that someone else can pick up the work at a later time without having to rebase all the time.

A change those three should follow shortly anyway because those are rendered invalid by this PR. The ABI and grammar at least.
