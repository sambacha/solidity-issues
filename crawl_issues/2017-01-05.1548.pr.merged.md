# [\#1548 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1548) `merged`: Remapping bug fix

This solves the bug whereby a remapping could overwrite a module context remapping. This fix maintains a default remapping unless a module context declares otherwise. Taken from #1525 .

Notes on why we should use isClosestContext function: 

We need a compare between the reference context and the current closest context and the tried against context. This gives us cleaner and stricter resolution of path remappings.

Actually, with this change, there needs to be an error thrown if a remappings context and prefix are the exact same but with different targets. Warning thrown if there are duplicates. Will add.

@chriseth whenever you get the chance can we merge this up? I'll throw a log in the changelog.

@chriseth I think you may be overthinking this. In the case above, I think `a/b` should simply map from `x` for target `e`, otherwise it makes for complicated usage that could mess things up moreso than it would help things.

@chriseth should be ready to go now.
