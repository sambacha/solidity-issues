# [\#1549 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1549) `merged`: Optimize optimizer

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-01-06 16:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1549):

Some performance optimizations are done to AssemblyItem and parts of the optimizer. It seems that this does not impact regular running times much, but it speeds up the optimizer more than five times.

Benchmark is the liquid democracy test suite of boardroom.

Numbers:
```
Compilation time before this change:
without optimizer: .17 seconds
with optimizer: 10.8 seconds

After this change:
without optimizer: .16 seconds
with optimizer: 1.9 seconds
```

I think I fixed the bug. Performance has to be re-evaluated, it might have degraded slightly due to the fix.

Re-evaluated performance and updated description of this pull request accordingly. The numbers did not change significantly.

All clear from me.
