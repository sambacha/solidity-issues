# [\#1576 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1576) `merged`: Type identifiers.

The purpose of this PR is to generate unique names for all types that compare different to each other, so that these names can later be used for assembly function names.

This probably has to be improved, currently it is possible to game the system by using specially crafted names for structs and contracts. Furthermore, I'm not 100% sure that this system actually provide unique identifiers, especially since most types are composed by prefixing, but arrays are composed by suffixing.

My proposal would be to escape or specially mark user-supplied names (e.g. `$UserSuppliedName$`, where `$`-symbols in `UserSuppliedName` are replaced by some escape sequence), but I don't have a good proposal how to reflect the associative structure of e.g. tuple types.

I think a unified format like `t#333_whatever_333#t` would avoid ambiguity, where 333 is the AST node ID.  Or, we can include the length of the following identifier.  Or, even going lispy

```
(mapping (address) (mapping (address) (contract "C" 334)))
```

I agree that parentheses would help a lot, the problem is that we cannot use parentheses, because the string has to be a valid identifier. We have to perform some kind of escaping. What about using

`$_` as "opening parenthesis", `_$` as "closing parenthesis", `_$_` as "comma" and any `$` that appears as part of a user-supplied identifier is escaped as `_$$$_`.

Then the type of `mapping(address => mapping(address => $C$))` would be translated in two steps to:
```
t_mapping(t_address,mapping(t_address,t_contract(_$$$_C_$$$_,123)))
```
and then to
```
t_mapping$_t_address_$_mapping$_t_address_$_t_contract$__$$$_C_$$$__$_123_$_$_$
```

@chriseth Something like that works.  Or, maybe we don't need `$`s.  We might just need to escape `_`s in the user-supplied identifiers.

but I guess parentheses are still really useful, otherwise `tuple(tuple(uint),uint)` and `tuple(tuple(uint,uint))` cannot be distinguished.

@chriseth alternatively you can specify the number of elements of tuples, but it's up to you to choose.

Now I think the identifiers are unique.  I made a comment about a trailing `_` but it's not a big problem.
