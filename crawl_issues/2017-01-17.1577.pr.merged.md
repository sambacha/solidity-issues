# [\#1577 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1577) `merged`: Gas table update

This might fix or not #1247 (hope Github does not catch this).

It's not testable until https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/3504 is solved.  It might be proper software engineering if we solve that first.

I think it suffices to use a recent ethereum version (i.e. if you want to run it on travis, you need to change something there) and then change `RPCSession::test_setChainParams` to include:

```
"params": {
...
		"homsteadForkBlock": "0x00",
		"EIP150ForkBlock": "0x00",
		"EIP158ForkBlock": "0x00",
...
}
```

@chriseth that might work.  So I'm making the tests fail.

https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/3514 needs to be solved before tests succeed.

This might need #1664.

I cannot reproduce the test failure locally using soltest against `cpp-ethereum` `develop` 50fcad3c22149cea5c28ed07b73efebde820f8af

Currently, the Travis error is not about the gas costs, but about `eth` killing blockchain.

The message about killing the blockchain is normal, the timeout is the actual error. "failed_create" is a transaction that takes very long to mine - perhaps we have to adjust the maximum time we wait for a mining response.

`failed_create` tries to recurse 1023 times and then create a contract. Maybe the docker on travis is that slow. Increased timeout to 2mins for a test.

I'm getting interested.

Perhaps it is better to use a specific binary instead of docker. We only need to run the end to end tests on a single platform now, because we do bytecode comparison. We can use this binary here (I created it from cpp-ethereum/develop right now):

Many tests fail for some reason.

Many tests still fail for some reason.

Must be rebased after JSON I/O was merged.
