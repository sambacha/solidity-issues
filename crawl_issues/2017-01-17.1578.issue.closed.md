I have tried:

running the `install_deps.sh` script.

running `cmake ..` again. 

running `make -j 2` again.

And each time I'm getting this strange error:

```

Any ideas for a quick fix?

I have not. Thanks for the tip. Probably a problem with xcode when upgrading to Sierra.

Thanks @federicobond the link worked for me. Specifically on macOS Mojave I needed to run:

```
open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
```
