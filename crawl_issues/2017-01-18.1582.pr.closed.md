I'm going to update the whole "Security Consideration" documentation part with respect to new research papers and new vulnerabilities. Also outdated issues will be modified.
Reference papers: http://alunnicollegioborromeo.it/tmp/tmp/tyding-vulnerabilities-ethereum.pdf 
(check the lists in this presentation, it's the most up-to-date and comprehensive)
