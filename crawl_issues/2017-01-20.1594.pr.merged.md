Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1480

Why cannot we make public accessor fulfil the method signature requirement? I.e. `Token` defines `function balanceOf(address)` and `mapping (address => uint) balanceOf` should match that signature.

@axic the interface requires an external and an internal implementation. The accessor function only provides the external implementation.

I guess now it's between @axic and @chriseth .

@axic can this be merged?

I would have assumed it provides both the internal and the external interface. Isn't that a bug in that case?

No, internally, you get a storage variable and not a function that returns the value of the storage variable.

@axic Please note that this particular PR just fixes the token so that it compiles again. This is unrelated to the decision about whether or not public storage variables are considered implementors of public functions.
