# [\#1598 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1598) `merged`: Change translation of implicit throws

Fixes #1589.

DO NOT MERGE, depensd on https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/141

@chriseth @pirapira  This adds a new invalid instruction that is used for encoding implicit throws that are emitted by the compiler. This makes it possible to distinguish such runtime errors from user-provided, explicit throws.

For some reason there seem to be three failing tests: `SolidityEndToEndTest/function_delete_stack`, `SolidityEndToEndTest/call_function_returning_function`, and `SolidityEndToEndTest/conditional_expression_functions`. The failures are due to a failing assertion in `CompilerUtils::moveToStackVariable`. However, it's not really clear to me why these changes should affect that assertion. It would be great if someone could have a look.

Thanks! Please don't forget to change the documentation, too.

@chriseth Thank you very much for the feedback. I pushed changes that should address it.

Did you have chance to look into why those three tests might be failing now? It it possible that my changes somehow uncovered a separate issue?

Can you allow me access to your pull request branch (this is a new github feature, I think)? Then I will make the required adjustments.

@chriseth Thanks! That's fine with me. I believe I checked some box about allowing this when I created the PR. I have also added you as a collaborator just in case.

This is still not fixed, but I think we are getting closer.

Ok, found the problem: Zero-initialized variables of internal function type have to be a tag. I found a solution above that is not the best yet, will submit a new version shortly.

@axic / @pirapira please review.

It is missing an entry in the changelog.

Updated.

Is the idea for `catch` to insert `tags` for the jumps? If so, using `invalid` for non-user exceptions is the right way.

@axic I don't think catch can really work in a consistent way (it has to roll back changes inside a single call), but if we do something like that, then `throw` will be changed from `jump(nonExistingTag)` to `jump(mload(mload(0x80)))` and catch will push an address onto the stack pointed to at address `0x80`.
