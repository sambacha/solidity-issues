@axic excellent! and it looks like it was a pretty easy fix. of course, the hard part is usually finding _where_ to fix it, not the fix itself. well done, sir!

Funny enough I had a very similar change in my branch:
```
-               if (i.type() == Tag || i.type() == PushTag)
+               if ((i.type() == Tag || i.type() == PushTag))// && i.data() != 0)
```

Just wasn't sure it is the right one. It was, almost ðŸ˜‰
