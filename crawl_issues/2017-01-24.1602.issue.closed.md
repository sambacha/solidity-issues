- [ ] modify the type system to support enums as they are, not as integers
- [ ] modify the signatures

Note that if the function signature changes, this might break new contracts interacting with old contracts.

We could just change the json-abi but keep the function signature.

Attack vector:

```solidity
contract MarketOffer {
    enum {Buy, Sell} type;
    ...
}
```

Somebody deploys that contract.

Somebody ELSE swaps buy/sell and uploads source code and contract metadata to etherscan.

Now your metadata on etherscan is deceptive. 

Why did this happen? Because this adds information to the ABI (again, I hate this word choice) which cannot be validated.

We have many of these examples already. The ABI is always a condensed version of the external interface.

I would argue that this is not a possible attack, though, since it should not be possible to verify the compilation - the hash of the source code is part of the deployed bytecode.

^^ This. Were this 2016 I would agree with you @fulldecent but as it currently stands this particular attack has been covered up. 

Either way...is it still on the roadmap to make structs "rust like" ?

I think #2899 will solve this.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
