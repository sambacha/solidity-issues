It's needed for testing, since we need to have the `eth` client installed

Update: on https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ethereum:
> I'm tired of pushing new releases as upstream does not really work on the client anymore and solidity has it's own package. I recommend everyone who really wishes to work with the C++ ethereum bindings, should use the **ethereum-git** package that serves the latest cpp-ethereum repository (that unfortunately has no release tagged yet).

@axic I also saw this comment. But regardless it's updated and its last update is yesterday. With this change, I can finally run the solidity tests on my machine.

@5chdn What do you think? We need a package that contains the `eth` client for testing. Is this the best option?

Yeah, I updated both packages yesterday, they are functional. The ethereum-git package is in good shape, using the latest HEAD from cpp-ethereum. The ethereum package, however, is still waiting for the 1.3.1 tag, or any meaningful tag, in the cpp-ethereum repository, and therefore still using the latest release from webthree-umbrella monster. users complain it takes 1-2 hours to build on some hardware :p

When I wrote I will discontinue the packages, it was back then when you guys had the big plans to separate everything into stand-alone repositories. this only happened with solidity so far. also, the name is misleading. would be better to have cpp-ethereum or eth/ethminer/solidity and whatever else important is included.

_tl;dr_ yes, ethereum-git is the best option to include eth right now.

Thanks @5chdn!

@5chdn we will improve the packaging experience with the next release which happens as soon as we hit HEAD on the mainnet...
