I found a couple of things hard to understand while trying to work on the CI, so I changed a couple of things. Included are:

* I added a build.sh script that works from wherever you are in the repo and added documentation to note this.
* I editted the install_deps.sh script to not include sphinx (as this should only be a concern of the CI document job)
* I made it so that the only time ./install_deps.sh installs cpp-ethereum client is when it is in the CI (for Travis atleast)...I suppose you also would get that with Arch as well. 
* I moved global envs to the top of .travis.yml and changed the names because they were confusing me when looking through Travis documentation.
* No longer do we test three times for the end to end tests because...that's been pretty well taken care of by now.
