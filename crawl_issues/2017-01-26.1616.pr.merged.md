# [\#1616 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1616) `merged`: Docker release automation

This makes automated dockerfile deployment a reality. Also reorganizes the CI with better environmental names, more sensible organization in terms of the travis.yml, sensible installation dependencies (not installing things that are not solidity related unless they are for the purpose of the CI), and the creation of a build script for solidity and updating the docs to reflect its existence.

@chriseth looks like everything is passing properly. One last review of the docker_deploy script?

@VoR0220 reviewing this is a bit beyond me (never used docker before), but splitting out the regular build script is a PR I could review / approve. That is kind of separate to the other changes too.

Indeed I could probably split that out and get that approved...along with maybe the other travis.yml bits?

I think the build script (+ the changelog and documentation bit) is good on its own. Travis could be separate to docker if you think that makes sense.

fair enough. Let me cut it out and push with a fresh branch.
