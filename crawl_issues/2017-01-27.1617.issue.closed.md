And include tests for all failure cases.

@hrkrshnn do you know if we check for error messages now?

There are some asserts in `libsolidity/interface/Natspec.cpp` for `@return`. In `libsolidity/parsing/DocStringParser.cpp` there are some parsing errors that are reported using `appendError()` function.

But I don't think there are parsing errors when a tag is repeated.

This https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8247 might be relevant for this.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
