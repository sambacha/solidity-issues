# [\#1621 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1621) `merged`: fix for linker wrt binaries generated with import statements

I ran into a problem and found out that it was actually a bug with how we've set up our linker. I also am not quite sure how we should test for this, so any ideas for that are also welcome. The problem can be outlined like this:

suppose that I have an import statement in one of my contracts that leads to a library. Suppose I also use the `-o` option to get `.bin` files (solc -o binaries --bin myfile.sol). Currently, that will generate a placeholder in the `.bin` file in the form of `__theFileThisLibraryIsFrom.sol:LibraryName______`. Couple this with the way linking CURRENTLY works (we search for the first `:`) and you can see that this leads to a problem when coming into linking as no matter what you do, you are bound to hit that first `:` and thus your library name gets included as your address along with an additional `:`. This fixes that by looking for `:` in reverse. Very simple fix. But not very sure how it should be tested. Any suggestions and I will write them up.

((facepalm)) Good catch.  I was 90% sure that I'd tested out the scenario you're describing, but it might have slipped through in one of the final tweaks that got made.

I thought we had stronger linker tests than we appear to, too.  Even just grepping the tests for "link" shows there isn't very much; I suspect this is because what linking gets done is done while the test is running.  I'm not sure there's a good way to test this in the future without writing a test that does exactly what you did to find the bug...that is, to emit output binary files with the symbols in them and then try a final linking.  I might have missed something, though.

I was thinking perhaps we could better structure the CLI tests but it seems those could get nasty very quickly. Hence why I'm looking for a bit of guidance here as to wth to do.

another potential fix would be that we just don't include filenames in the library linking for binaries...that could also be a potential fix. This one is easier for now, but I know for a fact of usecases where the the filename needn't be shared and where it would be preferable for it not to be.

I'll link the previous PR's conversation here for posterity, because really, that sort of decision is above my pay grade and maybe should involve @chriseth : https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1397

Dropping filenames trades one issue off for another; namely, you can now have a link-level collision on name.  I don't know which is more or less preferable an issue to have, which is why I won't comment.  The most logical thing I could think, off the top of my head, is that if filenames should be hidden, then it's more appropriate to obfuscate them, turning the linker symbol from `<filename>:<contract>` into, say, `<filename-hash>:<contract>`.

As for the testing framework, I'll also confess that I'm not really clear on how to achieve what we'd be looking for.

perhaps we could have both or rather than filename-hash, just be `<contract-code-hash>`...that's more legit imo, because I agree collision is something that ought to be avoided. Could maybe add it to the compilation output options...that'd be something I'd be interested in doing.

Seems pretty legit to me.  Again, I'm mostly a roving janitor grabbing
stuff marked "soon" in this project, but it looks like valid work to me.

The main issue is that we use a non-structured encoding for the libraries option. Using something like
```
libraries = {'my/file/name.sol': {'MyLibrary': '0x123'}}
```
would not have this problem. But it's coming!
