Discussion with @axic resulted in the following decision:

Snippets should be compiled via json-io (i.e. the snippet is not given using a special syntactical construct in the source file but rather as a full source file given in a special way via json-io) and they are required to be a full function.

Code was stale, but issue is still in scope.
