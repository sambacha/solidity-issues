Status: tests fail on Linux, but succeed on Windows.

No idea why the original `vector<Declarations>` didn't work on linux/mac, replaced with a `vector<string>` and now including `this` and `super`. Note: we could use the `currentThis()` and `currentSuper()` but that seems like an overkill.

Did you consider adding this code into `NameAndTypeResolver.cpp`? While perhaps conceptually less clean, it is much less error prone to add it there. We have the scopes, see what is visible where and so on. If we keep it as it is now and add a new declaration, we have to think about also adding it to the visitor here. As an example, you forgot to check for names of events :-)
Oh and what about `import x as msg from "y.sol";`?

Fixed the event and import case.

@chriseth Why should `StaticAnalyzer` exists in that case? :)

@axic it is not about static analyzer. The main design problem is that the scopes are not persisted in the AST annotations.

I'm not sure what is going on, for me it works on mac and linux (ubuntu), but travis fails at without any message:
```
Compiling ./scripts/../test/../std/StandardToken.sol...
```

I think the scope issue which could affect this is members of a struct.

I think it is better to add this change to `NameAndTypeResolver.cpp`, basically to anything that calls`DeclarationContainer::registerDeclaration()`. It would be good to perhaps add it to that function itself, but it does not have access to the error list. At that point, we could also check for any shadowing. One thing we have to check there is whether overriding a function is implemented as shadowing.

Rebased for good measure.

@roadriverrail would you be interested in looking into this?

@axic Yes, I'll look into this soon.

Similarly, I've gone ahead and done a rebase of this one, but I can't push to the repository.  Once we get that sorted, I can take on the comments @chriseth left.

Just a quick ping before the weekly meeting...I had a rebase of this set up a couple weeks ago so that I could finish the work on it, but I can't push to the main solidity repo on this branch.  If someone can please help me out with this, I can get this done. @chriseth @axic

@roadriverrail what is your progress on this? I would like to include this feature in the next version which can hopefully happen on monday.

We cannot really test imports inside this testing framework.
