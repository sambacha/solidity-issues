# [\#1651 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1651) `merged`: Add address.transfer(value)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-02-05 20:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1651):

Implements #610.

Throws if the CALL failed and doesn't has `bool` as a return value. Always provides the default gas stipend irrelevant to the transfer value.

As with `send` - do you remove the member if the target does not have a payable fallback? Also, I would say that zero value transfers should not fail. It is weird to send zero value, but I guess it is less surprising if they do not fail.

I've added `Transfer` to all places where `Send` was (and made sense), but need to double check if this is covered.

> Also, I would say that zero value transfers should not fail.

There's no check for that in this PR, but if I'd reject it that would be in the TypeChecker, e.g. shown to the user during compilation time.

```
contract A {
}
contract B {
  function B() {
      A a;
      a.send(1);
  }
}
```

The member doesn't seem to be removed for  `send` either. The above compiles without errors/warnings.

For supplying a custom gas value, which syntax to take:
```
addr.transfer.gas(1234)(1);
```

or 

```
addr.transfer(1, 1234);
```

The first matches what other `call` methods do, but the latter is clearer especially if we want `transfer` to be more widely used, while the others are for more delicate use cases.

By the way, what happens to contracts that define a `transfer` function like the ERC20 token?

The same as with `send`. The definition shadows (:wink:) it, and `transfer` can only be used with typecasting to `address`.

Though we should add a test to verify this.

Please remove the ability to set gas for transfer.
