# [\#1658 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1658) `closed`: Fine grained control of the optimiser

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-02-06 18:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1658):

Currently there are only 2 options:
- turn on/off optimisation
- number of constant optimiser runs

We do have a number of optimisations steps. It would be nice to have some of them switchable.

Eventually I would like to have a way to only run the peephole optimiser and nothing else if I wanted to.

In the current version, there is no way to turn off peephole optimization (it runs even if you do not specify `--optimize`), so we should probably provide a switch for that.

This can no be more easily achieved via json i/o.

Does it make sense to define multiple optimization levels?

 * 0 would do no optimizations
 * 1 would do block deduplication and peephole optimizations
 * 2 would do all optimizations in level 1 plus constant optimizations

Note that many people get confused about the runs parameter, which does not define how many "passes" the constant optimizer does, but the expected number of times a constant will be resolved to a value once deployed. We may want to find a better name.

I have a changeset which introduced flags for to turn on/off each optimiser step.

Postponed to 0.5.0

We should specify how to combine the IULIA optimizer settings with the legacy optimizer settings.

To support yul optimisations steps some options were proposed today:
```
optimiser: [ “peephole”, “yul”, “constants:runs=200"…]
```

```
optimiser: {peephole: true, stack: true, ..., yul: true, yulOptions: { ...}}
```

where `yulOptions` could be a string `cse,ssa,join,inline(weight:8)`

All options should allow some "default" settings.

I'd like to keep support for "presets" aka what we have today, the only two presets: none vs. all optimisations.

There should also be presets for the yul optimizer (we might not even implement the fine-grained control of the yul optimizer in the first release because the structure could change). Should "all" enable the yul optimizer or not? If not, can we change "all" to enable the yul optimizer at some point by default?

Another option that should be configurable: stack optimization in the code generator.

note that also the binary search in the dispatcher depends on the number of expected executions.

This was implemented via #5959.
