I guess it makes sense to make the reversion explicit (in contrast to `throw`), but we should probably also change throw to use the revert opcode.

I didn't intend to change `throw`, but I guess this is what users want and not a total consumption of gas.

As per the weekly meeting: `throw` would be *soft deprecated*. It would internally use the `REVERT` opcode, without any return value. We may in the future issue a warning advising the use of `revert()`.

This is actually not a breaking change, since `REVERT` will be an invalid instruction, effectively the behaviour is the same. Assuming that the opcode for `REVERT` is agreed on and no other instruction takes its place.

Haha, you are right! Can you change the documentation about throw and about exceptions (we just modified that some days ago...)?

Work for future PR:
- mention that revert won't consume all gas
- support string parameter: `revert("Something went wrong")`

I'd prefer to merge #1678 first and then update this PR.
