# [\#1665 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1665) `closed`: If a contract is not payable, `address(C).send()` should not be available.

Hm, perhaps we could change it to:
the `send` member is available on all addresses and all contracts, but if it is used for a contract that does not have a payable fallback, an error is generated.
And `address(c).send()` does _not_ generate an error, because you can send to any address.

we could also still provide the member but create an error inside the TypeChecker.

I'm not sure I agree with this...going to have to elaborate for rules that you have in mind. Just because a function itself is not payable doesn't necessarily mean that it shouldn't be allowed to release funds from the contract.

If the recipient is not payable, the send will result in a throw. (The discussion was moved from #1651.)

That part is true, but how far do we take this? How do we examine all external contracts for whether or not they are payable?

We send mobs to anyone trying to call it ðŸ˜‰ 

In my opinion, if we add this, it could be a warning too, which the user can ignore.

And again we settle for the warning *sigh* :)

^I like that.

I think I like the warning/error in the typechecker the most as that seems to be most valuable output to a user.
