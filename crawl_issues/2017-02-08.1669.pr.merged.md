@VoR0220 It seems that 0 bytes are returned (note the other lines have a new line because that is not cut off). That suggests `eth` crashed in the docker instance.

@axic perhaps it needs more time to boot? Or maybe it needs to be initialized with more memory in travis....not sure either way.

I think this can be merged once Appveyor passes again.
