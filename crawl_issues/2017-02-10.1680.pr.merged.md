This is run inside a docker container. How was this error introduced?

Not positive. Ive just noticed that deploy is erroring out on this line. Or...maybe not?

Changed...it's not related to that at all. It's literally something we missed when merging I believe the docker PR for the script deploy for emscripten...hence why every deploy is clouded with js.

```
-      script: test $TRAVIS_EMSCRIPTEN != On || scripts/release_emscripten.sh
+      script: test $SOLC_EMSCRIPTEN == On || scripts/release_emscripten.sh
```

Seems to be correct, it was introduced with 503cf4ea.
