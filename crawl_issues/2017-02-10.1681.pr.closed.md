# [\#1681 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1681) `closed`: [WIP] Desugar asm functions (aka. EVM codegen from Julia)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-02-10 16:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1681):

Issues:

 - [x] function definitions should be jumped across (also have to update documentation there)
 - [ ] Tests for: existence of new identifiers has to be checked also in subscopes
 - [ ] we have to specify that the stack height is reset to just the variables after a function definition.
 - [ ] check docs that function arguments are "reversed"
 - [ ] (probably general bug) if undeclared variables are used, they are simply skipped, example (this was an example at the time where argument and return variables were not yet registered):

```js
{
  function f(a, b) -> (c) {
    c := add(a, b)
  }
  let g := f(1, 2)
}
```
 - [ ] the assembler still generates some "unbalanced block" warnings for e.g.
```js
{
    function ack(x, y) -> (z)
    {
        jumpi(first, eq(x, 0))
        jumpi(second, eq(y, 0))
        z := ack(sub(x, 1), ack(x, sub(y, 1)))
        jump(ret)
        first:
        z := add(y, 1)
        jump(ret)
        second:
        z := ack(sub(x, 1), 1)
        ret:
    }
}
```

@chriseth what part, if any, can be reused and merged of this? I think it should be fine merging into the current directory, practically this adds support to EVM1.0 for functions.

Closing this in favour of a direct translation to EVM bytecode.
