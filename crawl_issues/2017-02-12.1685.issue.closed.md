# [\#1685 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1685) `closed`: Dont issue "Warning: This looks like an address but has an invalid checksum" when numerical operations are involved

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19823963?v=4" width="50">[yaronvel](https://github.com/yaronvel) opened issue at [2017-02-12 08:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1685):

In version 0.4.9 I get this warning
```
Warning: This looks like an address but has an invalid checksum
```
on the code
```
publicKeyHash & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
```
Would be nice if you can deduce that a number involved in numerical calculation is unlikely to be an address.


(for future readers a work around is to use `0x00FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`)

This warning is triggered by the all-caps of the constant and the fact that it has 20 bytes. Another workaround would be to use lowercase. We could remove the checksum check for all caps, though.

I was wrong, the warning is present for both all-upper- and all-lowercase. Modified the warning message to mention the way to silence the message. I think it is better to warn even if the constant is used in calculations.

I guess it would be nice if the warning could state that adding (e.g.) a leading zero will prevent the warning.

@yaronvel that's what I did: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1746/files#diff-9f2a45efaa7b75ab7ec620d3177cf01aR1586
