For some reason the StructDefinition visitor in TypeChecker is called twice:

```
interface Token {
^
Spanning multiple lines.
interface2.sol:2:3: Error: Structs cannot be defined in interfaces.
  struct A {
  ^
Spanning multiple lines.

Can you clarify please? You mean that enums and structs cannot be properly conveyed?

Need to decide what to do with `enum`s. Since it is not supported in the ABI yet, I'd just reject them now and enable them once the ABI support is added.

Contract types for example are converted to plain `address` in the ABI. Basically any named type is deleted in the conversion. Yes, please disallow enums.

@chriseth is there anything else needed in this PR? (apart from documentation wording)

@axic question. What is the plan for libraries WRT to this feature?

Suppose I want to create an interface from my contract to a far off library that operates externally. Could I do something like this?

```
library L {
     function f() {
          //do stuff
     }
}

interface I {
    function f();
}

contract C is I {
     function C() {
         f();
     }
}

```

Furthermore, could we extend it to maybe include internal functions in the future? I get the strict part for now and I suppose we could have a loose interface down the road.

How is `L` connected to anything in your example?

> Furthermore, could we extend it to maybe include internal functions in the future?

I'm up for extending it later, once we know all the bits and details. Much easier to extend then to restrict.

@axic what this needs is a couple of endToEnd tests. Can never be too careful.

This is still a problem and results in test failure.

That's kind of what I'm getting at...would there be a way to "link" based upon the interface? Could this feature be fleshed out further to be the placeholder for all linking? 

Perhaps I'm blowing it out of scope for right now, but that's something that could be incredibly useful for us at Monax atm, especially as we push libraries to their limits in Solidity.

@VoR0220 this is how you can use an interface:

```
interface I {
    function f();
}

contract C {
    function f() {
        I i = I(0x1234);
        i.f();
    }
}
```

@chriseth also @VoR0220 was concerned that libraries cannot inherit and whether it would make sense to allow them inherit interfaces.

I guess if we model the interface to be the external interface, it should disallow declaring `internal` functions.

@axic I don't think we should limit interfaces to the external interface. Disallowing private functions would make sense, though. Oh and note that internal has a different meaning for libraries.

That is a thing I've never quite agreed with :)

> I don't think we should limit interfaces to the external interface.

Why would we need an internal method in an interface though? To have an interface for libraries?

Ok, you are right, interfaces are only concerned with the external interface, because they are only meaningful when you use "pointers" to contracts. Interfaces for libraries do not work except when you only access external functions of those libraries, but even then, interfaces do not yet work like that because the `interface` keyword itself makes it a contract and not a library.

Test failure should be fixed now.

Just mining error on windows.
