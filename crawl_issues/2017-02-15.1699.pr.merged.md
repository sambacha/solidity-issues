Some refactoring around labels and identifiers.

This should be manually tested with some inline-assembly-heavy contracts like https://github.com/Arachnid/solidity-stringutils/blob/master/strings.sol and https://github.com/Giveth/milestonetracker/blob/master/contracts/RLP.sol

@pirapira please review again.

@chriseth that's in my queue (not so far away; 8th item now).

I do not believe this less-safe assembly language has much use out of code-generation from the safer core of the assembly.  (The safer core of the language makes sense as a common source before EVM and eWASM).

The main problem is the assumed layout of managed local variables and unmanaged excess elements is not enforced.

Also, the assumed layout is not explicit, requiring some mental (or side-note) calculation.  The side note calculations should be made explicit.  The source of the side-note calculation is the fact that stack heights change freely inside blocks.  If we disallow stack height changes without opening/closing blocks, we can get a language that requires no side-note calculations.

A block would have a format `element_producer '{' element_consumer '}'` or `element_producer '{' ':=' identifier  element_consumer '}'`.  In the latter case, `element_consumer` needs to use `identifier` once.

Both `element_consumer` and `element_producer` can be blocks.

```
2 { =: a  3 { =: b add(b, a) } } { =: sum pop(sum)}
```

To sum up: if the programmer needs to think about the stack at all, one can always program in EVM anyway.  The label with stack height adjustments shows that the programmer needs to think about the stack.

I showed a way to hide stacks but still stay low-level.  Instead of the stack, one can only think about blocks:
```
2 { =: a  3 { =: b add(b, a) } } { =: sum pop(sum)}
```
Here the programmer can forget about the stack.

If introduction of local variables, blocks and functional notations do not let one forget about stacks, the introduction just adds complexity over the original complexity.

I am having hard time reviewing this because there are related but different entities:
* stack height
* stack offset
* number of local variables
* excess elements,
none of which appears in the program explicitly, which can be changed by various ways
* instructions that change stack heights
* label with resetting
* label with symbols
* label with numbers
* block closure
* identifier access (read)
that needs some consistency in order to allow variable access.  I think now I'm figuring out the assumed EVM stack layout.

My suggestion collided with the notion of blocks being namespace-delimiting for labels too.  Translations of function calls hit cases where labels need to be found from outside of blocks.  My suggestions:

*  punch-holing: a label is visible from out of the scope when it is exported like this  `{ jump(label) [label]{  label: }   }`
* forward-declaration: `{ let l := label()     jump(l)  { l: something        } }`

Now I prefer the forward-declaration.

By the way, is it the case
```
label[a, b, c]:
```
can always be replaced with
```
a := 0
b := 0
c := 0
label:
```
?

Also,
```
label[-3]:
```
can be replaced with
```
pop
pop
pop
label:
```
?

Just note that I cannot answer these two yes/no questions.  That is the peril of adding a language feature.

At the same time, I also realize I don't understand this PR enough to request a change.

The result of a discussion was that we found a way to express the effects of the label annotations on the stack height without using label annotations. The idea was to add appropriate `pop` and `let x := 0` instructions inside unreachable code. This way, desugaring can be done without requiring new features in the low-level language.

A test is failing in two builds.

Found the test failure - invalid capitalization of the error string. It will hopefully work now.
