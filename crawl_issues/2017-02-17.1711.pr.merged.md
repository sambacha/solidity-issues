@pirapira this is ready to review. Sorry about it being quite large, but I split the single analysis-and-code-generation phase properly into two phases.

Now we have:

1. Parsing
2. Register declarations in scopes
3. Analysis (are all referenced identifiers available and accessible, is the number of arguments to functions correct and does the stack heigth match)
4. Code generation

Addressed most of the comments and also simplified the logic around `m_virtualVariablesInNextBlock`.

I'm confused about the stack layout, and many numbers involved.  Also, I'm confused about variables, and many kinds of identifiers involved.  I'm especially confused about local variables being essentially equal as state variables (while the code seems to distinguish them).  In general, I'm not interested in complicated programming languages because they do not help building bug-free software.

The list of things I have to check is growing rapidly.  I think I'll need three months to review this PR.  I'll throttle the time usage to 2h/day.

I think this code is complicated because of a design problem. The code is about assembly, but it talks about Solidity variables. Currently, the code deals with a mixture of three programming languages: EVM, assembly, and Solidity. We should separate stages for Solidity reference resolving and assembly compilation.

@chriseth do you need me to study the checkpoints above?  In that case, I'm willing to go over the whole code for each checkbox.  However, I doubt you need those checks.

My focus will be on the trusted computing base, and it does not currently contain Solidity or the assembly language. The trusted computing base consists of components that might break proven-correct Ethereum contracts. The trusted computing base contains the Yellow Paper, the EVM definition in Lem, EVM implementations, the network layer, and PoW/PoS algorithms.

For a programming language to enter the trusted computing base, it needs an executable specification that is tested against the implementation.  I'll push that direction before reviewing and auditing the Solidity compiler implementation.

I had a discussion with @chriseth on Gitter. In my point of view, I was trying to find a way to reduce the complexity of the language being analyzed here. The focus was on the Solidity identifiers appearing in the assembly. The only reason that Solidity identifiers appear here is the inline assembly.

I suggested removing Solidity identifiers before analyzing the assembly. However, this was deemed difficult for two reasons: without running the @analysis, one cannot `(a) know whether an identifier actually refers to a variable "outside" and (b) to calculate the correct stack offset.`  These are design flaws I argue (see below).

The assembly language is designed as a common compilation target from Solidity and other programming languages. So, inline assembly with Solidity identifiers needs to be translatable to assembly without Solidity identifiers. I believe the current assembly language fails to provide an adequate abstraction level to which Solidity and inline assembly can be compiled into. This is because (a) the assembly do not distinguish its variables from variables declared in Solidity (this can be done by putting `$` in front of assembly variables) (b) the assembly lacks stack access primitives (e.g. `$n` indicating nth-local variable). Because of these design flaws, we are failing to isolate the Solidity identifier dereferencing from the rest of the assembly processing.

The problem in this PR is that the code analyzing assembly also looks up Solidity declarations.  This is a solvable problem.

A more concrete way to see the problem is to look at the language between the Solidity compiler and the assembler.  Solidity compiler emits assembly and assembler reads the assembly.  The assembly language should not contain Solidity identifiers because it is an output from the Solidity compiler.  The assembly should be before the desugaring process because the assembler performs the desugaring.

So, the assembler should not see Solidity identifiers.  Now there are three possibilities:

1. if this PR is a part of the assembler but not part of the Solidity compiler, it should not access Solidity declarations
2. if this PR is a part of the Solidity compiler but not part of the assembler, it should not try to parse the assembly
3. if this PR is both a part of the Solidity compiler and the assembler, we are not separating concerns across different tools.

---

EDIT.  Case 3. applies.  We get away with the argument that, in principle, it should be possible to build a Solitidy compiler that emits assembly and a separate assembler that takes it.

The actual picture is far more complicated, the analyzer and the code generator in the assembler calls back Solidity object.

I think I have some moral duty to minimize the cost of this assembly with Solidity identifiers that cannot be translated away.  That's why I thought I should stop anything happening around this language, and I should block this PR.  Now I guess it's more costly keeping this branch around and keep it rebased than merging it.

TODO: Together with restricting external variables to exactly one slot, we should add the following "feature":

If in inline assembly, an identifier is about to be resolved externally that ends in `_slot` or `_offset`, the following should happen:
 - If the identifier itself exists, issue an error about a collision of identifiers.
 - If the initial part does not exist or is not a storage variable, issue an error.
 - If we are not in lvalue context, error.
 - Otherwise: Return the storage slot or offset of the variable, respectively.
If a storage variable of value type is referenced in lvalue context, push its value.

The analyzer has to make sure that jumps do not cross function boundaries because the stack height information does not make sense over function boundaries.

Alternatively, the analyzer can throw an error when functions and labels appear in the same code.

I think, in the future, we should add stack-height checks for `jump($tag)`s.

For jumping to addresses on the stack, I guess we can desugar carefully and cross fingers.  We have only one case there.

About "Compare stack counting in analysis and code generation phase." (checkbox above) I'm actually not sure anymore which elements of the stack counting should be compared. We currently compare that the stack delta at block boundaries is equal (both have to be equal to zero). Should we also compare the effect on the stack size for every single AST element?

@chriseth yes we should.  Otherwise we are not keeping the conditions stated in the documentation, for instance,
```
For functional-style assignments (``variable := value``), you need to provide a value in a
functional-style expression that results in exactly one stack value
```

Need to add a flag to select parsing between "inline assembly" and Julia. In Julia mode it will:
- enable functions
- enable for statements
- enable switch statements
- enable tuple assignments with `let`
- enable types
- disable labels
- disable assignment from stack
- check that everything is assigned or discarded
- (potentially something else)
