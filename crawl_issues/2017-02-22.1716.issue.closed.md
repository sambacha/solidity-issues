# [\#1716 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1716) `closed`: Timeouts in IPCSocket::sendRequest

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-02-22 11:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1716):

During the tests, calling the RPC method `unlockAccount` often results in a failure. This function is synchronous and takes quite some time to respond, so the reason might be that the single `recv` call inside `IPCSocket::sendRequests` returns early. We might want to change this into a loop with a larger timeout.
