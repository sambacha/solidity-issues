# [\#1728 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1728) `merged`: Convert reference types to pointers in member function conversion.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-03-01 15:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1728):

Fixes #1415 

The function `asMemberFunction` takes a function type and converts it to the type that is used for `myContract.functionName` or `this.f`, i.e. the view on an external function when it is called from outside. Because of that, calldata types are converted to memory types since this is how the arguments have to be encoded for the call (you cannot encode anything into calldata, only decode from calldata). During this conversions, everything was taken as a reference type as opposed to a pointer type. Non-pointer reference types are only used for state variables because then, they can be used as lvalues. Since function arguments are never state variables, the correct way to do the conversion here is to convert to pointers.
