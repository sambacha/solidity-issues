TODO:
 - [x] document that such constant expressions might have side-effects on the memory allocator.

So what happens with my contract code?
https://github.com/ethereans/github-token/blob/master/contracts/LockableCoin.sol

```solidity
contract LockableCoin is AbstractCoin {
    //creation time, defined when contract is created
    uint public creationTime = now;
    //time constants, defines epoch size and periods
    uint public constant UNLOCKED_TIME = 25 days;
    uint public constant LOCKED_TIME = 5 days;
    uint public constant EPOCH_LENGTH = UNLOCKED_TIME + LOCKED_TIME;
    //current epoch constant formula, recalculated in any contract call
    uint public constant CURRENT_EPOCH = (now - creationTime) / EPOCH_LENGTH + 1;    
    //next lock constant formula, recalculated in any contract call
    uint public constant NEXT_LOCK = (creationTime + CURRENT_EPOCH * UNLOCKED_TIME) + (CURRENT_EPOCH - 1) * LOCKED_TIME;
//(...)

@3esmit the compiler will generate an error for `CURRENT_EPOCH` and `NEXT_LOCK`. You can easily fix it by changing those two into private functions.

@chriseth can we have a keyword to evaluate expressions? So I just change constant by volatile or expression and continue using this way.
The current behavior is really useful, because each of any call these variables are updated, without needing to call any function or modifier.

@3esmit sorry, but I think such a feature would be really misleading and dangerous. What is the big deal about adding `()` after every use of `CURRENT_EPOCH` and `NEXT_LOCK`?

If is documented than how can be misleading?
Calling it constant, indeed is misleading, but if you use other name, such as `expression` it gets pretty clear that is evaluated every call.
To do that same thing I need to one of the following:
1. function nextLock(){} and every call will consume more gas
2. uint nextLock; that is updated by modifier after each call that uses it. 

I don't know how is the gas consumption of using a constant expression like I did in my LockableCoin, but I liked that it updates automatically without needing to call the function. 

```
contract LockableCoin is AbstractCoin {
    //creation time, defined when contract is created
    uint public creationTime = now;
    //time constants, defines epoch size and periods
    uint public constant UNLOCKED_TIME = 25 days;
    uint public constant LOCKED_TIME = 5 days;
    uint public constant EPOCH_LENGTH = UNLOCKED_TIME + LOCKED_TIME;
    //current epoch formula, recalculated in any contract call
    uint public expression CURRENT_EPOCH = (now - creationTime) / EPOCH_LENGTH + 1;    
    //next lock formula, recalculated in any contract call
    uint public expression NEXT_LOCK = (creationTime + CURRENT_EPOCH * UNLOCKED_TIME) + (CURRENT_EPOCH - 1) * LOCKED_TIME;
//(...)
```

@3esmit internal function calls are extremely cheap, just try it. A simple example using your code above was 600 gas in the expression case and 680 in the function case.

@pirapira extended the documentation.

By the way, what is the merit of this `constant` state variables over a pure internal function that takes no arguments?

Updated. @pirapira you are correct that this feature is rather similar to pure functions with no or constant arguments, but I think it still has a reason to exist as a shorthand.

@chriseth now I think `constant`s can become a general mechanism to introduce shorthands.

Had a discussion with @chriseth and expressed my opinions:
* `constant` in a function argument and in a state variable should mean something analogous
    * this PR can be seen as a subset of this
* if a `constant` state variable behaves like a pure function, let pure functions take over

I think this is a breakin change.  So 0.5.0?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) commented at [2017-03-14 14:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1729#issuecomment-286443052):

@pirapira it is debatable whether this is a breaking change according to documentation, but it certainly is one according to how this feature is used (e.g. by @3esmit). What about turning this into a warning for now and make it an error in 0.5.0?

@chriseth that works.

Restarted the test.
