#### System information
``````
Solc: `0.3.6-0.4.9'
**Remix**
``````
This was first discovered by ACloudFan and reported here: [http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12623/solc-compiler-oversight-innappropriate-mapping-declaration-overwrites-storage](http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12623/solc-compiler-oversight-innappropriate-mapping-declaration-overwrites-storage)

When a mapping is (inappropriately) declared inside a function, data stored will **overwrite data stored in properly declared mappings**. 

**Expected Behavior: mapping inside function = compiler error**. 

```js
contract Mapping {

  mapping(address => uint)  balancesA;
  mapping(address => uint)  balancesB;

  function Mapping() {
    // constructor
    balancesA[msg.sender] = 100;
    balancesB[msg.sender] = 200;
  }

  function getBalance(address addr) returns(uint balanceA, uint balanceB) {

    // If these 2 lines are commented then behavior is as expected
    mapping(address => uint)  balancers;
    balancers[msg.sender] = 500;

    return (balancesA[addr], balancesB[addr]);

  }
}
```

Returns (500,200).  Expected response: (100,200). 

We have found many instances of this behavior using different compilers and using Remix on different platforms. We have found no configuration that produces the expected results.

Thanks for reporting! This is a traditional use of uninitialized variable. The compiler should produce an error here.
