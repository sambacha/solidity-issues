# [\#1738 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1738) `closed`: Unexpected implicit casting in Solidity's exponential operator

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12790330?u=93f973ed85ec0c341023d85050ee1d3eb2be6679&v=4" width="50">[o0ragman0o](https://github.com/o0ragman0o) opened issue at [2017-03-04 03:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1738):

While investigating an incorrect token award bug in an ERC20, it's come to light that there is an apparent inconsistency in casting with regard to the exponential operator `a**b`. In particular, the output casts to type `b` rather than type `a`.

So when calculating a decimal place exponent `10**exp` where `exp` is defined `uint8 exp = 3` the output is truncated to 8 bit giving the answer of `232` rather than `1000`.

If the base is definded as `uint8` and exponent of longer type, e.g.`uint`, the compiler will throw an implicit conversion error which indicates the output should be of type base and not exponent.

This doesn't seem to be affected by non-compound parameters which are all cast to 32bit slots anyway.


    contract PowerOfTest {
        // Returns 232
        uint8 public placesA = 3;
        uint public EXP_A = 10**placesA;
        
        // Returns 1000
        uint public placesB = 3;
        uint public EXP_B = 10**placesB;
    
        // Returns 1000
        uint8 public placesC = 3;
        uint public EXP_C = 10**uint(placesC);
    
        // Type uint256 is not implicity convertable to expected type uint 8
        // uint public EXP_D = 3;
        // uint8 public placesD = 10**EXP_D;
    
        // Returns 1000 for `pow(10, 3)`
        function pow(uint base, uint8 exponent) returns(uint)
        {
            return base**exponent;
        }

        // Returns 232 for `pow(10, 3)`
        function pow2() returns(uint)
        {
            uint8 EXP_D = 3;
            return 10**EXP_D;
        }
    }

The result type of any binary operator in Solidity (also admitting that `**` as a non-commutative operator should be treated differently) is a type that can fit both argument types. The result of the expression `a**b` is always the "larger" type of `a` and `b`. Note that the type of the variable the result of the expression is assigned to does not influence the type of the expression itself.

As a solution, I would suggest to use `uint(10)**placesA` and the compiler should add a warning whenever the base of a `**` operator is a constant.

Ok, so I understand that `10` is being taken to `uint8` also.

Yes, constants assume the smallest type they fit into as soon as they hit a non-constant.

Thanks Chris, lesson learned.  I'd quite forgotten about literal casting.  A warning would certainly help
