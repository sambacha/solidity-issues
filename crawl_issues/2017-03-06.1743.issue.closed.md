# [\#1743 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1743) `closed`: SolidityLexer.py missing 'delete' and 'for'

Unless there's something I'm missing, it looks to me like the [SolidityLexer.py](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d4da4ef35f8118d49bed54f11392036e1d31f7e7/docs/utils/SolidityLexer.py) is missing the _delete_ and _for_ keywords.

Thanks for pointing out!
