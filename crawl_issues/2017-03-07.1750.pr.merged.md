# [\#1750 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1750) `merged`: Disallow octal numbers in parser.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-03-07 11:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1750):

Previous versions of Solidity would parse octal numbers as octal while the documentation stated that they were interpreted as decimal numbers. Since the arcaneness-to-usefulness-ratio of octal numbers is quite high, they are disallowed to avoid confusion.
