# [\#1756 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1756) `closed`: Assembly: geth-style output

The Assembler should have a switch to output assembly in "geth style", i.e.

- only statement-style notation
- all label references prefixed by `@` and, if possible swapped with the following jump opcode
- all constants prefixed by `push`.

I think this feature is obsolete now, but it should still be possible to generate that from the `Assembly` object if needed.
