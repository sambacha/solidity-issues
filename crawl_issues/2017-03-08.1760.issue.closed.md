# [\#1760 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1760) `closed`: Disallow unary plus
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

Expressions like `+x` should be disallowed as they serve no purpose and are especially dangerous in situations like `a =+ x`.

Is there any scenario where you want to preserve the unary `+`?

Ah.  As per #1184 it's been concluded there isn't a meaningful purpose for the unary +.  I'll remove it and replace it with a hard error stating its deprecation.

Please use a warning for now and keep this issue open.

I'll step up for this to now be an error as I wrote the deprecation warning.

PR for this as experimental feature: #2939 
We should probably continue to leave this open until we fully strip the operator from the parser.

Can there be more detail put behind this change? Many people don't understand what unary + does, I believe adding a tad of more clarity in the official docs would help a lot as right now they just say `The unary + operator is now disallowed.`
