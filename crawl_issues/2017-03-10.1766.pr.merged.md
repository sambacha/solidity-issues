# [\#1766 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1766) `merged`: Updates for gcc 6.3.0 and Boost 1.63.0

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2017-03-10 01:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1766):

Built gcc and Boost from source, then attempted to build the Solidity project from source. Ran across a couple build-stopping errors with (seemingly) backwards-compatible fixes.
