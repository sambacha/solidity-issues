# [\#1772 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1772) `closed`: Optimize constant arrays (and other values) by computing at compile-time
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

In the following code, accessing the array elements should have a time-complexity that does not depend on the array length:
```js
contract C {
  uint[20] constant x = [uint(1), 7,8,9,7,6,5,4,4,5,8,7,68,5,4,4];
  function f(uint i) returns (uint) { return x[i]; }
}
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

It would have been a great addition.
