# [\#1775 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1775) `closed`: less-than or greater-than comparison accidentially allowed for addresses

Solidity has a separate type `address` that cannot be added or multiplied and only be compared against one another.  I think comparing addresses for equality makes sense, but larger-than or smaller-than does not make sense.

Currently ( 409eb9e3e494ad5a45c14eb7f550ad8fad2b5573 ) the following program passes the compiler:

```
contract A {
  function f() {
    address a;
    address b;
    a < b;
  }
}
```

This was done on purpose. The reason is to allow for data structures that require an order on keys.

That's reasonable.

What the essence of the larger than or smaller, order of keys in what sense???

Can thiis always check that a ! = b too in some cases?? Or just for ordering?
