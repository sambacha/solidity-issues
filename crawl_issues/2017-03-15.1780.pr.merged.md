Still to do:
 - [x] tests for the optimizer

The emscripten build seems to have a different metadata hash. I also had this problem locally, it was caused by a dirty checkout, so there was a `.mod` suffix in one of the versions.

Can we change the report into a JSON? Would be easier to process from the outside.

@axic actually I think "unix-style" formatted files are better, then you can use plain `diff` to process and do not have to parse them.

Depends on the tool processing the output. What will be that tool?

The tool is already in place: https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity-test-bytecode/builds/212095113

Can you squash some of the commits? Things like *try again*.

@axic of course, once it is working.

The only missing problem is that `emscripten` has a line
```
test_83f0aa75b311a45c431c12e757e19c7739832c9910b7cceac5a1660bb623d14d.sol: ERROR
```
while the others don't have that line.

@axic ok, this should be the final version. We might still have a problem that windows and travis end up with different commit hashes, but that should be solved once we run this not on a pull request but on an actual repo push.

@axic can this be merged?
