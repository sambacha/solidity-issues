> It could be quite confusing to call these `modifiers`. Do they need a name?

They are quite a strange language feature though, a kind of modifier on the function type. Any wording suggestion?

As I said, I think we can work around by not giving them a name: "`.gas()` and `.value()` are only available..."
We can call them by there more generic term "members".

How about "with special settings `.value()` and `.gas()`"? Or "options".

Changed to option, felt way more natural.
