I think we had this discussed a few times, but no decision reached yet.

I think throw was a misnomer - we cannot catch anything and reverting a transaction is not actually the same as throwing an exception.

@chriseth if we are committed to this, I think for the next release we might want issue a warning on `throw;` and suggest `Use require or revert.`.

Then in the breaking or the next breaking release it could be removed.

Even if we remove throw as a feature, the keyword should be kept. We might be able to introduce something in the future.

This looks simple enough for me to knock out quickly.

We have a warning already, so this issue now is about removing support for `throw` in two ways:
- a) in the parser and the AST. It should still remain as a keyword in `Token.h`, or
- b) turn the warning in the error.

Option a) makes sense if we don't want to use `throw` any time soon.

just simply use revert() or any of the shown error and replace the throw()...Trust me this works

@axic I don't think I am.  My commitments at my job have gone up
approximately 3x and it'll probably be a few more months until I come back
around.  I'll see you guys when things get calmer here.

No worries, Rhett! I'll just remove your assignment so it is up for grabs.
