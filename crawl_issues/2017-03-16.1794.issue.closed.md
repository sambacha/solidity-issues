The [latest release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.10) seems to omit the filename prefix that was introduced [previously](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.9). If that happened intentional, I would suggest to again highlighting this in "Things to look out for" in the release notes. Also the `--overwrite` might break some build tools and could be highlighted in the same way.

Can you given detailed instructions about how to reproduce?

```
# solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.10+commit.f0d539ae.Linux.g++
```
This is my toy contract in `test.sol`:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;

contract test {
  uint u;
  function f(uint _u) {
    u = _u;
  }
}
```
Then I create an ouput directory and compile as follows:
```
# mkdir out
# solc test.sol --bin --abi -o out/
# ls out/
test.abi  test.bin
```
Not that it matters to me but these files used to have the prefix `test.solc`.

I just tried and get exactly the same behaviour with 0.4.9.

@SCBuergel can you please comment what behaviour do you get on 0.4.9?

Closing due to inactivity.

Sorry, took me a while to get back to this but now tried on macOS:

Installed 0.4.9 (found that via commit history of homebrew-ethereum, hope it's the correct one) via brew:

>$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/8d77bba3c9a682b507d923b336bd61558e25d329/solidity.rb
>$ solc --version
>solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
>Version: 0.4.9+commit.364da425.Darwin.appleclang

Next I created a folder `testsol` in which I created the above mentioned `test.sol` file and contract (changed the pragma to 0.4.9), then I compiled and inspected the output:
>$ solc test.sol --bin --abi -o out/
>$ ls out/
>test.bin		test.sol:test.abi

Which has the prefix in contrast to all later versions. This is just an inconsistency compared to previous versions and I am strongly in favour of not having such prefixes as it leads to issues like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1631.

We don't have the capacity to fix bugs in older versions. Note that the file-based output should not be used by automated tools. Instead, please use json-io.

Makes sense, it also wasnt my intention to request changes in an older versions but just to highlight an un-mentioned breaking change back then.
