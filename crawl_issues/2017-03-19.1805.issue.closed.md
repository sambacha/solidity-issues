Version: 0.4.10
Platform: macOS

Possible solidity parser error when trying to define a public variable of function type.

Example:
https://gist.github.com/anonymous/54bac24c6173350b814c79dac5664625 compilation fails with the error message "ballot.sol:2:37: Error: Multiple visibility specifiers.
    function(bytes memory) external public example;"

It seems reasonable that `function(bytes memory) external public example;` should be valid syntax for a public variable of the "function(bytes memory) external" type, so there might be a parser bug here.

Good catch. Both `external` and `public` are visibility modifiers, so they cannot exists on that single line.

As a workaround you could use this:
```
contract C {
    function(bytes memory) external _example;
    
    function example() returns (function (bytes memory) external) {
        return _example;
    }

    function example(function (bytes memory) external new_example) {
        _example = new_example;
    }
}
```

Using a typedef feature (#1013 or #1100) or a better notation for function types (#1349) is the actual solution.

@axic Concerning workaround: adding the "getter" function manually is of course always an option, but the reason I wanted to set the variable to public was to automatically get a "getter" function for the function, just like you can do with other variables/maps.

I still think this is a bug since the `external` visibility modifier refers to the function and the `public` visibility modifier refers to the variable which happens to be of type function.

Barring supporting the `function(bytes memory) external public example;` syntax directly, it looks like (#1349) is the best way forward among options you proposed; it will probably make it easier to separate visibility modifiers for the function and the variable during parsing.

Yes, it certainly is a bug in the parser.

I would say it is rather a bug in the notation.

To fix it while keeping the notation:
- the parser would need to lift the useful restriction of single-modifier-only for function types,
- a new field must be added to the type to signal it is an accessor and
- the type checker needs to validate the a non-storage function type cannot be an accessor

@axic I don't really follow. My suggested fix would be to only allow `external` and `internal` while parsing function types. Once the parser sees the `public`, it would divert back to parsing a variable - the `public` is not part of the type it is part of the variable declaration.

Oh well, it is another bug too - we only allow `internal` and `external` for function types. In that case it should be simpler :)

Just to clarify, these statements should be made valid and equivalent:
```java
function(bytes memory) a;
function(bytes memory) internal a; // (explicit internal applies to the function type)
function(bytes memory) internal internal a;
```
```
function(bytes memory) external a;
function(bytes memory) external internal a;
```
But now we have to guard against someone declaring:
```
function(bytes memory) internal external a;
function(bytes memory) internal public a;
```
Is that right?

Your first 5 examples should be correct by the following reasoning:

`function(bytes memory) a;`
internal variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference a public function

`function(bytes memory) internal a;`
internal variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference an internal function **or** internal variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference a public function

`function(bytes memory) internal internal a;`
internal variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference an internal function

`function(bytes memory) external a;`
internal variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference an external function **or** external variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference a public function

`function(bytes memory) external internal a;`
internal variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference an external function

The following should be incorrect since state variables can't be external:

`function(bytes memory) internal external a;`
external variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference an internal function.

The following should be correct (and the one the parser currently misses):
`function(bytes memory) internal public a;`
public variable called "a" containing 24 bytes that reference an internal function

Hope this helps

@Balajiganapathi if you are looking for another task, this might be a good fit
