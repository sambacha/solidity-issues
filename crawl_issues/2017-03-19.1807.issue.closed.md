@chfast I have seen that somewhere else and have the impression you fixed that, can you say anything here?

solidity project still requires boost installed in the system. in cpp-ethereum use use ExternalProject, but I'm in the process of migrating to hunter package manager.

I actually sent a PoC for Boost: https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/3653.

Basically this is solved by making Boost an externalproject in cmake?

Yes. But I'm not sure you wanted.

I can integrate Hunter with Boost, but I need an approval for it.

Nothing with this particular one. This can be closed as the solution is to install boost headers in system.
