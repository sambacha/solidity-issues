# [\#1809 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1809) `closed`: Not able to link a lib if you have >= 36 symbols in the path

I get the error `There is no lib to link with __src/library/MyAppTokenLibraryN.sol:M__`

This happens because full path does not fits in the library placeholder and than compiler cannot find it.

That's an error message from Ethereum Studio. It has troubles looking for libraries with long paths and names.

But in general I think 36 symbols are not enough to define a library with its path.

This is already possible if you link at the same time when you compile, but user experience should improve with json-i/o.

loosely a duplicate of #1645

Should be fixed by #1639.  Please reopen if it isn't.
