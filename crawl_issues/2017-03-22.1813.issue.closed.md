# [\#1813 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1813) `closed`: solc binary 0.4.10 has a format issue

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20029714?u=69b14a2f7c4c9266746f910904dd43e159da9ec6&v=4" width="50">[islandBilly](https://github.com/islandBilly) opened issue at [2017-03-22 16:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1813):

I just downloaded the solc file, and moved it to /usr/local/bin, but when I tried to test it, it gave an error that indicates there is something wrong with the binary:
~$  /usr/local/bin/solc --bin Test.sol
bash: /usr/local/bin/solc: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error

Am I missing something? I just wanted to get a local compiler to work with my geth node via web3...

No binary is suitable for all platforms. What exactly is your platform?

I am currently using the XtraPC, which is a live Linux USB thing built on
the Trusty Ubuntu system. It's running on an aging Toshiba laptop, but I've
had no trouble with geth and Mist so far.

Might it be that you are running a 32 bit platform?

Ah, yes. My aging laptop has a 32 bit processor. Somehow, I thought that if
geth could run on this system, solc could too, but now you mention it, of
course there is no reason for that to be true. Thanks.

You should still be able to get a 32 bit solc via the PPA system:
```js
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install solc
```

Perhaps we should include `64` or `x64` in the file names of the Linux releases?

Well if you change the name of the solc binary in the release list, it will
probably see up people's script coding. Everybody knows it as solc. But you
could put a reminder in the readme md...

It was only added the last release and has the name changed since.
