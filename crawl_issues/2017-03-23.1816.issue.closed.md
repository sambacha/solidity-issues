# [\#1816 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1816) `closed`: Warn about some expression statements without side effects

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-03-23 09:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1816):

This is a story to implement as much of
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1380
as possible already now. It is better to have many false negatives than no warning at all. We can probably re-use the "is pure" analysis for constant variables here.
