Currently, the assembly has no syntax to access externally defined things.  So, the assembly currently cannot be used as inline assembly.  This issue keeps track of establishing an interface for the assembly to access externally defined symbols.

The current convention seems to use identifiers ambiguously for internally defined symbols and for externally defined symbols.  However, in this treatment, an assembler cannot throw an error about undefined symbols without access to the context.  For enabling assemblers to throw errors without accessing the external context, externally defined symbols need to be syntactically distinct from internally defined symbols.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
