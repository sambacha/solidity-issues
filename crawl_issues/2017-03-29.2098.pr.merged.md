# [\#2098 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2098) `merged`: Introduce formatExceptionInformation

It is also used byte StandardCompiler, hence another code duplication.

Additionally all the `printExceptionInformation` in the CLI could be replaced, though that seems a bit backwards.

An include seems to be missing, otherwise fine.

@chriseth changed the CLI too. It is more clear and the new line is controlled by the caller.

This reminds me that some of the newlines perhaps should be removed in SourceReferenceFormatter.

@chriseth I think this can be merged
