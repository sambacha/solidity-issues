Note that "Julia" is the name of [an existing language](https://julialang.org/)

I've just [reworked](https://github.com/gnidan/solasm/commit/fc9631efd3f96ab69946cc3e0a6a91ad54a84cc2) my parser to conform to this new grammar.

Two questions: 
1. Have label definitions been removed?
2. What are the syntactic elements for the arguments to a function call? They're still listed as AssemblyItem, which has become Statement, but I wasn't sure if they should be Expression. (Expression would limit some things / have different meaning?)

Yes, labels have been removed and FunctionCall should be `Identifier '(' ( Expression ( ',' Expression )* )? ')'`.

Another question: If there is a function that does not take arguments (for example the built-in `calldatasize()`) - do we still require parentheses?

Argument in favour: This would clearly distinguish function call and variable access.
Argument against: It might be better read- and writeable if you can omit parentheses in that case.

Ok, this is a first take at specifying the whole thing. It still needs some work about the scopes, but I think it can actually be expressed simpler than I am currently doing it. loops might create some trouble, especially `break` and `continue` and of course sub-assemblies. I thought about perhaps breaking up the sub-assemblies a bit more providing for some generic "data" area:

`data "type" { ... }` where `type` can be `assembly` or `hex` or whatever and it determines what is allowed inside the `{}`.

Width of variables is not defined as the IR is agnostic of this, but it assumed to be 256-bit by the higher level language. That also determines what the target backend can expect.

I think it would be useful to include a way (such as `variable:256`) to define the desired width and supporting 32, 64 and 256 only.  That way, a non-EVM target, such as Webassembly can efficiently support native types.

Likewise, it perhaps would make sense defining widths and conversions for literals:
`int32(42)`, `int64(42)` and `int256(42)` to define the literal `42` as a 32, 64 and 256-bit.

Furthermore, it could raise a failure if the literal is out of bounds for that width.

Also please consider a different name, as there's another fairly well known language called Julia ðŸ˜‰ 

I nominate *Simone* as it starts with the letter S and there was an AI sci-fi with the same name.

Responding to responses:

Labels â€“ does the removal of labels give some kind of benefit re:, say, no more stack-height bookkeeping? Otherwise I'd say they could be quite useful as valid syntax, as I would imagine the desugaring phase would make good use of them.

Function calls with no args â€“ I'd vote for requiring parens; allowing/requiring them to be omitted seems like it adds a lot of complexity

`data "type" { ... }` / generic data mechanismÂ â€“ Definitely in favor of this being well-defined.

Will look at the spec part later on

@axic I think we can add `: Identifier` to specify a named type (the names are from a namespace unrelated to the namespace of variables and functions). Types have to match for arguments to functions and assignments. Conversion functions can be built-in functions similar to the evm opcodes.

Concerning the name: I don't think there will be confusion.

@gnidan labels: desugaring towards EVM of course requires labels, but desugaring will also translated JULIA to a different language that has lables but does not have functions for example. The benefit of not having labels is that the specification does not even need a stack (as you will see in the code). Labels and scoped variables also don't live well together.

One more note: this language has unlimited number of return values, while Webassembly is limited to one. It will need to wrap functions which return more than one to store some of their results in memory.

Maybe it would make sense reviewing the pros and cons of limiting it to a single return value for EVM. If it is reasonable limiting it even in EVM, then it would reduce the complexity needed for the Webassembly target.

This PR changes `assembly.rst` and the current flow suggests that inline assembly is a subset of Julia. I think that is incorrect and we still need to support "old inline assembly" even if we introduce direct Julia support from Solidity. Therefore I suggest to move Julia-related documentation to `julia.rst`.
