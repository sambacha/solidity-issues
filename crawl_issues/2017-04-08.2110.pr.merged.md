# [\#2110 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2110) `merged`: Fix PostTypeChecker retaining state across contracts

Closes #2108

The `m_constVariableDependencies.empty()` solAssert in `visit(ContractDefinition const&)` was failing because the visitor retained constants from previous contracts.

`scripts/bytecodecompare/storebytecode.sh` is [failing](https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity/jobs/220126698).  Does this mean comparison failure or some other problems?  @chriseth

@pirapira means that creating the report (e.g. all the test sources compiled and saved to a github repo) failed

Failure appears unrelated. CI outputs "iv undefined", so I looked into the bytecodecompare.sh script and found this [line](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/bytecodecompare/storebytecode.sh#L83):
````
openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_60701c962b9c_key -iv $encrypted_60701c962b9c_iv -in "$REPO_ROOT"/scripts/bytecodecompare/deploy_key.enc -out deploy_key -d
````
Which leads me to think that the `encrypted_60701c962b9c_iv` variable may not be set correctly.

The reason for the failure is that this is an external pull request that does not have access to the private key required for the upload. We could improve that script :-)

Thanks for looking into this bug!

We can guard the script with `TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS != "true"` in the .travis.yml file.

@federicobond can you please investigate the other way to solve it? I think currently, even if you only have a cycle in a single contract, you get multiple reports of that cycle, which is not a bad thing, I would say.

Taking this Solidity code as input:
```
contract Foo {
  uint constant a = b;
  uint constant b = a;
}

contract Bar is Foo {
  uint constant c = b;
}
```

With my current patch:

```
test.sol:4:3: Error: The value of the constant a has a cyclic dependency via b.
  uint constant a = b;
  ^-----------------^
test.sol:5:3: Error: The value of the constant b has a cyclic dependency via a.
  uint constant b = a;
  ^-----------------^
```
But if I don't clean the state and remove the assertion instead, I get this:
```
test.sol:5:3: Error: The value of the constant a has a cyclic dependency via b.
  uint constant a = b;
  ^-----------------^
test.sol:6:3: Error: The value of the constant b has a cyclic dependency via a.
  uint constant b = a;
  ^-----------------^
test.sol:5:3: Error: The value of the constant a has a cyclic dependency via b.
  uint constant a = b;
  ^-----------------^
test.sol:6:3: Error: The value of the constant b has a cyclic dependency via a.
  uint constant b = a;
  ^-----------------^
test.sol:15:3: Error: The value of the constant c has a cyclic dependency via b.
  uint constant c = b;
  ^-----------------^
```

Does that mean that your way to solve it does not even detect the cyclic dependency caused by c? Admittedly, I don't see a way to create a cyclic dependency in Bar by referencing a variable in Foo while Foo does not yet have a cyclic dependency, but this is not true anymore if you can do things like `B.c`.

I guess the way to achieve that would be to just clear `m_constVariables` but not `m_constVariableDependencies`.

Also, `findCycle` could be improved to not just find any cycle, but just a cycle that contains the initial node. I think that there is no case where we have a cycle that does not include at least one of the newly added variables.

But `c` is not "causing" any cyclic dependency in my example, since you can take it out and the cycle will still be there. Another way to put it is that `c` is not inside the cycle of the dependency graph, only `a` and `b` are.

> but this is not true anymore if you can do things like B.c

How does that work?

@federicobond yes, that's what I am saying. I think it is fine to only create an error if you have a cycle that ends up again at the variable you started with. Using `B.c` is not yet supported, but it is not too far away.

@chriseth I'm not seeing a problem in this PR.  Maybe that's because I don't understand what can go wrong with `B.c`.  I'm believing it's totally fine to detect cycles locally in a single contract.

Ok, so let's keep this until we extend the lookup across contracts. Sorry for the hassle, @federicobond :-)
