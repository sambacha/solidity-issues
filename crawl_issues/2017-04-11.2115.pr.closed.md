# [\#2115 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2115) `closed`: Fixed issue with Swarm Hash implementation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2148266?u=a28d8ae21039534aab83cacc995837f94bc60995&v=4" width="50">[conor10](https://github.com/conor10) opened issue at [2017-04-11 04:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2115):

The Swam Hash implementation has an error in the function `swarmHashIntermediate`. The `_length` value was being used for the final hash, regardless of the size of the `ref` local variable.

Also, what was the original reference used for the implementation?

It was validated against `bzzhash`, the tool included in go-ethereum. The length is always the total length and not the chunk length as far as I remember.

I think it is the idea of the swarm hash to not include the size of the intermediate hashed chunks, but the size of the actual data that is represented.

@zelig can you comment here? Is our swarm hash implementation correct?

@conor10 if I remember correctly, it was quite hard to find a specification, but we built the implementation looking at the reference implementation in go and cross-checked the values. Please tell us why you think the length field should only take the chunk length into account and not the original length. Until then, I will close this pull request.

@chriseth - yes I struggled to find a specification reference. This PR emerged from looking at the code, and questioning why it was implemented this way:

- When working with a payload > 0x1000, the payload is broken down into chunks which are individually hashed.
- Once all of these chunks have been hashed, the aggreagate of these chunked hashes is hashed. 
- In this aggregate of hashes, instead of using the length of the aggregate, the code uses the length of the original input buffer, which appears counter intuitive to me. 
- As the length you are encoding in the aggregate hash, is not the length of the payload (the aggregate hashes), but in fact the length of the original payload that the aggregate hashes were generated from.

I appreciate the commend by @axic that this is expected, but it if this definitely is correct, it would be useful if there was a clear reference link or explanation in the code as to why this is, as it's not intuitive.

Cheers!

sorry I didnt notice this. 
Indeed it is the length of the subtree as 64bit littleendian prefix so the original implementation is correct.

@chriseth @axic 
As an important heads up: we are changing the basic chunkhash used in the swarm hash, from plain SHA3 to a SHA3-based binary merkle tree hash.

Basically, the you build a left balanced binarry tree over the (potentially 128) 32byte segments of a chunk and take the root hash of it, prefixed with the length and the chunkhash is the hash of that.

This will allow us to have compact logarithmic proofs of inclusion with 256bit resolution for any datasize.
In a following phase we are switching to POT serialisation of manifests which will allow proofs of inclusion validated against ENS registered content hashes for entire sites or databases. The word size in solidity (argument size for EVM calls) makes this optimal

The BMT hash and its application to proof of custody is found in the smash/crash orange paper.
http://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/theswarm.eth/ethersphere/orange-papers/2/smash.pdf

A reference implementation of BMT hash with top-down recursion is really simple to understand.
https://github.com/ethersphere/go-ethereum/blob/bmt/bmt/bmt-r.go

A much more performant concurrent implementation is only 3-4 times slower that plain SHA3 on full-length chunks. https://github.com/ethersphere/go-ethereum/blob/bmt/bmt/bmt.go

Note the above links might break as the code is merged to main go-ethereum

HTH

Thanks for the heads up, @zeilig! What is the time-frame for this and is there any versioning involved or is it just a breaking change?

We currently prefix the swarm hash with some identifier (I cannot remember what it is exactly), so this could be easily used to indicate a new "version".

We have `bzzr0` for this very reason :)

The CBOR encoded `{"bzzr0": <Swarm hash>}` is in the bytecode.

Though we are not using it within the metadata JSON.
