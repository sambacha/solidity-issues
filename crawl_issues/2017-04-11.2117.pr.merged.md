Without this pull request, `solc --optimize --asm` sometimes throws exceptions.

@pirapira ready to merge? Note that the actual representation might change in the future depending how the IR evolves. This is just to make it not throw.

I'm wondering if it's easier to just remove the check `i.first < m_subs.size()`.  I think I heard something like, `i.first` might be small in case of subassembly, but I didn't understand the explanation.  Can `i` be a subassembly?  It does not look like so to me.

If `m_data` contains two different kinds of things, I need an issue about separating these things in different containers.  Otherwise, I think the check can be removed.
