# [\#2121 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2121) `closed`: Compiler does not throw error on improper use of `revert` keyword

The `revert` keyword can be used in two ways that may cause confusion. As a function call `revert()` in solidity, or as an opcode `revert` in inline assembly.

The compiler however does not throw an error if used as a keyword in solidity instead of a call.  And the compiled bytecode does not contain the REVERT opcode as might be expected.

    contract Revert{
    
    // Improper successful compilation on invalid use of `revert` keyword
    //  JUMPDEST 			function r1() {\n        rever...
    //  JUMP [out]			function r1() {\n        rever...
    function r1() {
        revert;
    }

    // proper use and function of keyword as function call
    //  JUMPDEST 			function r2() {\n        rever...
    //  PUSH 0			revert()
    //  PUSH 0			revert()
    //  REVERT 			revert()
    function r2() {
        revert();
    }
    
    // proper use and function of keyword in assembly
    //  JUMPDEST 			function r3() {\n        assem...
    //  REVERT 			revert
    function r3() {
        assembly {
            revert
        }
    }
    }

This is not an error in Solidity, since you can reference functions in expressions without actually calling them (try replacing `revert` with `sha256`), but in this case, I think there is a potential for introducing serious security bugs in contracts, so perhaps we should give it more thought.

Besides preventing the case you mentioned, I would find it easier to understand `revert` as a statement like `break`, `continue`, or `return` rather than a builtin function call.

Example to execute unreachable code by improper use of `revert`. `a` is assigned `1`. 

    contract RevertFail{
        uint public a;
        function unreachable() returns (bool)
        {
            if (true) revert;
        
            // should be unreachable but executes anyway 
            a = 1;
            return true;
        }
    }
 
I agree use as a keyword would be more consistent with the `throw` like nature of the operation.  However given there are live versions of solidity that allow this, k developers and auditors will have to take into account the additional factor of versions allowing valid and invalid use which may cause additional confusion.

The REVERT opcode is not active in any Ethereum network AFAIK, so it's far from widely used.

`revert()` will result in a failed execution (and have the same effect as `throw;`). Once the `REVERT` opcode is supported by the network, it will not consume all the remainder gas.

As correctly demonstrated in `function r2()` of my example code.

However here is some [live code as a demonstration](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/65ikqa/eip_140_reverse_bug_bounty/)

Having read your reddit post, I do not see what bug you are talking about. The way to call revert from Solidity is `revert()` as it is a function, not a language keyword.

One can reference and assign a function without ever calling it, e.g.:
```
function () {
  var a = revert; // reference and assign
  revert; // reference without assignment

  a(); // execute
  revert(); // execute
}
```

The referenced issues deal with providing warnings if an empty statement is encountered. That will provide a warning for `revert;`.

So having read the code of my contract, would you send it money?

You are not using revert in your code. Your fallback function has an empty statement.

See the documentation http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=revert#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions :

Setting aside the argument as to whether this should be a keyword or a function, Solidity should definitely output a compiler warning for statements that have no effect, such as `revert` or `2 + 2`.

@Arachnid that is tracked in #1380 / #1816, as mentioned earlier.

Preference would be for a keyword as it's intent is to depreciate the keyword `throw`. however 0.4.10 would need to be flagged as insecure given the different resultant bytecode of `revert` to future versions

I do not entirely see the relation that `revert()` must be a keyword, because `throw` was one. `assert()`, `require()` and `selfdestruct()` all abort a contract, yet they are not keywords. Furthermore, revert accepts data to be returned (not yet supported in the language).

> however 0.4.10 would need to be flagged as insecure given the different resultant bytecode of `revert` to future versions

This statement assumes that `revert` would become a keyword.

`assert()`, `require()` and `selfdestruct` all take arguments. `revert` needs none

As mentioned, `revert` can (will) take an argument with the reason of failure (possibly a string).

Sorry, misunderstood that.  Wasn't fully aware of the future intentions of `revert()`

I thought I already created an issue for that. We should at least warn for such uses of `revert` and later implement #1816
