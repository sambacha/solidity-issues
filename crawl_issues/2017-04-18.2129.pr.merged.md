Split off #2107 in order to show what layout I thought about.

Fixes #1484.

 Didn't wanted to push to #2107 because that messes up the comments (closes the ones we haven't addressed yet).

Question about this effort: is a formal description of the desugaring phase to be covered by this spec?

It may make sense to have a "blob" or "bytes" type, which is preallocated and can be used by `mstore`/`mload`/`return`/`codecopy` etc.

Essentially abstracting the memory into variables, where there could also be one referring to the entire memory.

@gnidan this spec is actually more abstract. Desugaring is only relevant for translating JULIA programs into EVM, but it can also translate into eWASM and EVM1.5.

@axic blob might also be an element of the higher level type system.

The usual example we have is allocating a memory object. This can obviously work on a reference/pointer basis:

```
    {
        let size := calldatasize()
        let data := allocate(size)
        // note, this operates 
        calldatacopy(data, 0, size)

        // load first 32 bytes
        let sig := mload32(data, 0)
    }
```

Not entirely sure whether it is practical or useful to have this other than as a pointer. Though my main motivation is that in wasm the memory most be expanded explicitly and not implicitly by writing out of bounds.

The notes from today regarding the definition of "data":


```
{
     let offset, size := data "julia" {
     }
}
```

vs.

```
{
  let offset := dataOffset(dataName)
  let size := dataSize(dataName)
  data dataName "assembly" { ... }
  // interleaving instructions here will not be placed between the data chunks?
  data otherData "hex" 0x2348
}
```

or perhaps something like this

```
// Code consists of a single object. A single "code" node is the code of the object.
// Every (other) named object or data section is serialized and
// made accessible to datacopy / dataoffset / datasize
object {
	code {
		let size = datasize("runtime")
		let offset = allocate(size)
		// This will turn into a memory->memory copy for eWASM and
		// a codecopy for EVM
		datacopy(dataoffset("runtime"), offset, size)
		// this is a constructor and the runtime code is returned
		return(offset, size)
	}

	object "runtime" {
		code {
			// runtime code

			let size = datasize("Contract2")
			let offset = allocate(size)
			// This will turn into a memory->memory copy for eWASM and
			// a codecopy for EVM
			datacopy(dataoffset("Contract2"), offset, size)
			// constructor parameter is a single number 0x1234
			mstore(add(offset, size), 0x1234)
			create(offset, add(size, 32))
		}

                // Embedded object. Use case is that the outside is a factory contract,
                // and Contract2 is the code to be created by the factory
		object "Contract2" {
			code {
				...
			}

			object "runtime" {
				code {

				}
			}
		}

		data "Table1" "0x4123"
	}

	data "Table2" "0x4123"
}
```

While I'm still against naming this JULIA (due to julialang.org), if we stick with this name, I propose to use the extension `.julia`, because the other one uses `.jl`.

Also once we settle on a name, I'd like to rename the `ir` field in the JSON I/O to the decided name of the IR.

Explicit type conversion functions must be available in Julia, where converting from larger to shorter type will have overflow check and can cause runtime exception:
- `u32tobool(x:u32) -> (y:bool)`
- `booltou32(x:bool) -> (y:u32)`
- `u32tou64(x:u32) -> (y:u64)`
- `u64tou32(x:u64) -> (y:u32)`
- etc.

Need to add `object`, `code`, `data` to the grammar.

@chriseth @pirapira please review the grammar

I'll focus (next week) on closing off the builtin function list here so we can finish the builtin function PRs.

Finally rebased. Now back to finishing builtins and after that this can be finally merged-ish.

@benjyz:

> @axic you're aware there is already a language called Julia - https://julialang.org

Yes, see my earlier comments above.

I think we should perhaps already merge this even if the builtins are not finalized.

Yes, for avoiding rebase pains and for getting feedbacks from more readers.

Created some issues for the pending ones, merging this now.
