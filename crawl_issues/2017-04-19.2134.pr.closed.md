Looks like the test is failing because of a broken function trying to convert a line ending, is this my fault?

I guess no point to repeat the same. Where the code explains why `.send()` or `.call()` is problematic, those should be used, but I think in any other case we should stick to `.transfer()`. 

Note, that by moving to `.transfer()` (and `require()` / `assert()`, the `pragma solidity` must be updated to reflect the version those features were added in.
