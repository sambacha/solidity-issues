# [\#2136 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2136) `closed`: Change the new operator to use CREATE2

This might require keeping a nonce or other measure to make the creation bytecode unique if `new` is used multpile times on the same contract.

Would that counter be shared across the contract for all creates, specific to the create in a certain code location or specific to creating a specific contract?

I have written up this: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/solidity-compiler-magicians-wanted-to-make-create2-usage-easier/2137

Yesterday I made this ERC20 contract (which is supposed to work under State rent when holders pay for storing their tokens): work: https://github.com/ledgerwatch/eth_state/blob/master/erc20/TokenContract.sol

As you can see in the code, Solidity provides ``create2`` assembly function, but working with it is cumbersome. It would be much easier if there were 2 new features in Solidity:

1) ``new2`` operator. Similar to ``new``, but also accept ``salt`` parameter, and uses ``CREARE`` opcode. So in my ``Factory`` I would have written ``Holder holder = new2(Holder, _owner)`` without having to put the byte code of the ``Holder`` contract inside the function
2) Function ``create2_address``, which allows computing address of ``CREATE2`` contract. I would have used it twice, first in ``Token.getHolderContract`` function: ``address payable holder_address = create2_address(factory, a, Holder)``, and second in ``Holder.setOwner`` function: ``require(create2_address(factor, _owner, Holder) == address(this))``

It would be great to have (at least in a branch) a version of Solidity (derived from the current) supporting these two things. That would make further development of contracts like that much easier.

The new2 function you suggest could be rather tricky to implement. What might be easier and could be almost as helpful to you would be something like `Holder.creationCode` and `Holder.runtimeCode` - read-only properties of type `bytes memory`. What do you think?

Yes, that would definitely be helpful. And also the code hash, of course, because it can be computed at compile time

@chriseth Your `bytes memory Holder.runtimeCode` sounds dangerous. It is possible to create contracts which dump different runtime code than what you might expect. This involves using the `return` opcode in the constructor via assembly by hence pushing different bytes to the deployed code than what solidity expects it will deploy.

Separate from the `.creationCode` and `.runtimeCode`, I would still like to see a `new2` operator (that takes a salt).  Dropping down to assembly should only happen when the higher level language doesn't support what you need to do, and if people are frequently dropping to assembly (as is happening with `create2`) that suggests the language is missing a feature that is in high demand.

Sometimes people drop into assembly to do things they _shouldn't_ be doing, and I don't think we should be adding Solidity language features for such operations.  However, using `create2` is a good thing and should (IMO) be encouraged, but that requires a Solidity level language construct for it.

Any there any suggestions for the syntax? I really dislike the `2` in the opcode, by the way. What about

`salted_new(salt) C(a, b, c)`

or just

`new(salt) C(a, b, c)`?

We might even go so far to use

`new(salt, value) C(a, b,c)`

to replace `(new(salt) C).value(value)(a, b,c)`

I like `new.salt(s)` - we could introduce that with a non-breaking release already - although the parser looks a bit involved, so it might break the AST.

We might change it so that `.value` and `.salt` are special expressions directly in the AST, though, instead of generic members of expressions.

Suggestion from @axic:
`new{salt=...,value=1} C(..)`
`new<salt=...,value=1> C(..)`
If something like the above is accepted, the idea is to remove `.value` and `.gas` for all functions.

I also like `new{salt=..., value=...} C(...)`, but it's probably harder to parse `<expression>{value=..., gas=...}()`.

I'm pretty strongly against `C` and `c.f` and `g.h` or anything else with single letter variable names.  Words don't take up meaningful amounts of space, and clarity is king in smart contracts.  We should always prefer verbosity over brevity in any language constructs IMO.

Actually based on discussion with @ekpyron if you consider the curly brackets to "wrap functions with a modifier", then the following makes sen:
```
  { c.f, value=42, gas=1 }(a, b, c);
  { cond ? c.f : g.h, value=42, gas=1}(a, b, c);
  {new C, value=42}(a,b,c);
  {new C, value=42, salt=...}(a,b,c);

In this case, the following be valid?
```
  {c.f}();
  {new C}();
```

I would have used it twice, first in Token.getHolderContract function: address payable holder_address = create2_address(factory, a, Holder), and second in Holder.setOwner function: require(create2_address(factor, _owner, Holder) == address(this))

Since we have `type(Holder).creationCode`, how about adding `type(Holder).calculateSaltedAddress(salt)` ?

I am writing account contracts and there is a specific use case where I am having to override a function because I am unsure about gas operator. 
The override takes place to set if gas is manual or not. 
There is a magic value (such as 0 or MAX_INT)? In case of `{gas = 0}`, what happens? and in case `{gas = MAX_INT}` (MAX_INT can be any value greater then the block gas limit)? To set the gas to "auto" I have to use `{gas = gasleft()}` ?
