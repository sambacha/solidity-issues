# [\#2139 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2139) `merged`: Warn on unused local variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614752?u=1565826f2b2d74054639e6500236b073aa10f81a&v=4" width="50">[roadriverrail](https://github.com/roadriverrail) opened issue at [2017-04-20 15:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2139):

Analyze functions for all local variables, parameters, and named
return variables which are never used in the function, and issue
a warning.

This partially resolves issue #718

Can you add a test for `var a = 1;` ?

@axic Sure.  Just to ensure that we're all clear, I would claim that "var a = 1;" on its own does not count as using the variable.  Correct?

Correct in my view. `a` is not used.

So, this is blowing the Travis CI build because Token.sol is full of "unused variables."  I personally think that, in a function with no implementation, there's no point to policing unused variables, since often variable names help document the semantic value of the parameter to people who end up implementing the function.  I'll see if I can find a way to suppress the warnings in this case.

I think `Token.sol` should be an interface.

Can you add a test that interfaces are not checked for unused variables? Functions in interfaces cannot have bodies, so I assume it already works without problems.

Interface example:
```
interface Token {
  function transfer(address from, address to, uint value);
}
```

Can you please rebase this pull request (and also remove any extra merge commits while doing so)?

Sure.  I'll add the test.  That shouldn't be an issue.  I can also change
Token to an interface.  I think rather the rule of turning off the unused
var warnings for all functions with no implementation will catch it all
pretty cleanly.

Yep.  I'll do so after adding the test you requested and fixing up
Changelog.

I wouldn't do that in this PR. That wasn't done yet because there's no release which has interfaces and also that would break older compilers relying on `github.com/ethereum/solidity/std/Token.sol`.

This should now be rebased, cleaned up, etc.

(Also, I promise that I've fixed my `.vimrc` to see spaces/tabs correctly)

Could you also add code that `return <something>;` marks the return variable as used, while `return;` does not?

I can add that.  I'm sure there's enough legacy code out there doing its returns that way that we kind of have to.
