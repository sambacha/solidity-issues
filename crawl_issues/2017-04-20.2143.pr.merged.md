Fixes #2142.

True, this should be enough:
```
unsigned index = -1;
for (auto const& s: m_sources)
    indices[s.first] = ++index;
```

Took a minute to figure out why this changes things.  Yes, many side-effects.

I just checked our coverity run, it did not find the issue. :-( There might be similar issues in other places.

```
./ast/Types.cpp:                memberTypes.reserve(m_memberTypes.size());
```

Nevermind, too late to notice the `m_` prefix.

I wonder if it would be more consistent to first sort them and then assign the indices. We could use some boost range adaptor magic for that (but we don't have to):
```
map<string, unsigned> indices;
for (auto i: m_sources | sorted | indexed(0))
    indices[i.value()] = i.index();
return indices;
```

In that case `sourceNames()` must be sorted too.

I think this should be merged as is, because sorting might have some other side-effects somewhere. I'm fine in having them sorted in a separate PR.

`sourceNames` is sorted, iterating over a map returns the items sorted by key

What does `m_sources | sorted | indexed(0)` sorted and indexed mean here?

Ok but then my comment above is void. Just for some fun, something like the following could also work:
`return boost::copy_range<map<string, unsigned>>(m_sources | indexed(0))` :-)

I would have no idea what `return boost::copy_range<map<string, unsigned>>(m_sources | indexed(0))` is doing ðŸ˜‰ 

Looks fun though
