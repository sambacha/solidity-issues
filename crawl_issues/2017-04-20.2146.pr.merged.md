What is left to do here? Can you work on this next, @axic?

Reviewed it again, I think the API (`isTargetRequired`) and the part using it is clear enough, but the actual implementation is broken, hence the tests failures.

It also doesn't support wildcards properly and shortest match.

Need to add tests for matching different combinations (`evm`, `evm.*`, `evm.assembly`, etc.)

Damn, the reason for failure was a typo, `file` vs `_file`. This just shows the bad naming :)

@chriseth This is working now (as confirmed by circleci). It still needs support for shorcuts (e.g. `evm.bytecode` matching `evm.bytecode.object`)

@chriseth can you review this? it may be worth even merging it in this state, though more tests cannot hurt.

@chriseth I think this should be ready now?

@chriseth added two more commits to simplify/optimize it even more (last 3 commits should be squashed). Please check those two.
