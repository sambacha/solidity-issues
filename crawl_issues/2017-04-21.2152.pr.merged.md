Can you add a test for `var a = revert; a;` ?

@axic such a test would be identical to `uint a; a;`, but I'll add it.

@axic it turns out such code will not trigger the warning, because `a` is not considered pure by the current code - it could be changed in a loop or so. I guess we will still catch most of the cases.

Note that this is not detecting all cases of side-effect-free statements, the rest will be done in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1380

I know it is useless because they are regular functions, but would it make sense having a test for all the critical ones (revert, assert, require, selfdestruct)? Just in case some other future feature would mess them up.

Added the tests.

Travis was a sporadic single failure, windows error was race condition with bytecode upload.

@chriseth can there be an issue about the race condition?
