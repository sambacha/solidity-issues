TODO:
- [ ] tests
- [ ] same format for input as Solidity
- [x] same format for ouput as Solidity
- [x] change LLL `(include ..)` to be restricted (#3008)

Note that lll is currently disabled for emscripten, I think because it uses some more boost libraries that are quite large (e.g. spirit). Let's see how it compiles.

I just took a look at what spirit does in the LLL compiler (hey, I'm new to this C++ stuff!) and I can't see removing its use without a total rewrite of the parser, at the very least. I'm just hoping that enabling it for emscripten will be practical. The world needs LLL! :)

Fixed compilation, now we can see if it works with emscripten.

This is now also blocked by LLL's `(include)` which has no restrictions to access files.

> @axic , couldn't this one be closed (due to the announced deprecation in https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.0/lll.html) ?

That's sad news. I had no idea LLL was up for deprecation and eventual removal from the Solidity repository. A lot of work has gone into [documenting](https://lll-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [explaining](http://bit.ly/2F8qBIG) the language. The first Medium article I wrote has over 12,000 views with a 46% read ratio. LLL is arguably still the most efficient language on the EVM, producing the smallest binaries.

@lazaridiscom 

Not only is it as good as I say :) but it's being used in a couple of high-profile projects in their smaller, often-invoked contracts for the very efficiency I mentioned. Also, it's finally possible to add support for LLL in Truffle, so many more people will be exposed to the language as a choice there.

> LLL does not belong within the Solidity repo (see issue #5393).

I completely agree with this and have said that for the last couple of years. It would be wonderful if LLL were broken out into a separate repository. Then the language could have its own release schedule, version, etc. I have minimal C++ experience but I would certainly do what I could to help the process along.

From #5393: @axic said "split out a library by strict refactoring, then use it from multiple projects"

That would be the cleanest route to take. Long ago I suggested Git submodules for the parts of the code base that were shared between languages. Submodules were not viewed positively by the Solidity team at that time. I don't know how they're viewed these days.

I was considering what should happen to this last week.  I think my current view is that it is a bad idea finishing this, because then removal of it would be a breaking change.

I don't think anyone has the capacity to finish this and I'd say effort should instead be put into finishing the LLL to Yul compiler as a separate project.
