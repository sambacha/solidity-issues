# [\#2195 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2195) `closed`: Remove Why3 translator
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

The Why3 output is not maintained and there doesn't seem to be a plan for maintaining it. Would it make sense removing it?

@chriseth @pirapira any thoughts?

We should go ahead and remove it.  Otherwise people will try it out and find it not working.  I'm not going to do anything about the Why3 interface.

Instead, I'm going to
1. use [Rosetta](https://emina.github.io/rosette/) on the VM/Julia level and check for `0xfe`s.
2. use Lem/ML to build executable specification of Solidity

Yes, back when I wrote the do/while loop, I think I saw that Why3 didn't
exactly support one, and I thought perhaps Why3 wasn't going to fit.

I agree, we should build the verification from bottom to top. Rosetta looks nice and implementing an interpreter for julia in it is certainly doable!

So then we should remove it form JSON I/O right now before the release.

@axic just make it optional in the spec

or just remove it from the spec
