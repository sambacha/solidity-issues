# [\#2199 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2199) `merged`: Deprecate use of unary '+'

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614752?u=1565826f2b2d74054639e6500236b073aa10f81a&v=4" width="50">[roadriverrail](https://github.com/roadriverrail) opened issue at [2017-04-29 00:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2199):

The unary '+' serves no meaningful purpose in Solidity and it makes it
possible to produce typos with dagerous implications (e.g. 'a =+5 '),
so we are deprecating it.  The SyntaxChecker currently issues warnings
on the unary '+' but will still compile it for now.

This PR resolves issue #1760
