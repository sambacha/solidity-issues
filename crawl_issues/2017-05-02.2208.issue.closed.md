The bytecode check fetches the repository solidity-test-bytecode and runs the check on the newest complete directory. It turns out that a fresh (depth 2) checkout of that repository does not set the modification time of the files. We need to find a different way to sort them, probably by git-internal modification date.

This has been fixed in the last few days.
