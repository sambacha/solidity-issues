Preferably this should be merged after the 0.4.11 release.

Depends on #2114.

For some reason this is able to crash the fuzzer:
```
Testing soljson via the fuzzer...
scripts/../test/cmdlineTests.sh: line 80: 12897 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) "$REPO_ROOT"/build/test/solfuzzer --quiet < "$f"
```

The crash was fixed by #2263.

@chriseth how do we feel about this one? Probably more tests wouldn't hurt before merging this.

There is the `test/libsolidity/JSONCompiler` suite. This change didn't affect the tests.

Compiled this with emscripten and ran the solc-js tests - they are green. Merging and checking in the next days if remix works with it.
