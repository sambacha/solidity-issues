Without the analyzer, not even the printer test works.

@chriseth do you want to write the analyzer part in this PR? I can add more tests.

Just noting some ideas for tests:
 - check that variables declared in init are visible in condition, body and post.
 - check that variables declared in body and post are not visible in condition, init and post
 - check that variables declared in post are not visible in init, body and condition
 - check that it is possible to declare the same variale in body and post (should be child-scopes of the same scope)

@chriseth I cannot approve this given it was opened by me.

The example about **library VectorSum** in the documentation (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assembly.html#example) does not work for me when using **function sumPureAsm(uint[] _data)** that contains the **for** statement.

When running the example I get the following

```
truffle(development)> c.sumAsm([1,2,3])
BigNumber { s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 6 ] }  // This works as expected

truffle(development)> c.sumPureAsm([1,2,3])
BigNumber { s: 1, e: 0, c: [ 1 ] }  // This does not work (should be 6)
```

I also changed the version of solidity compiler from **pragma solidity ^0.4.16;** (documentation) to **pragma solidity ^0.4.9;** and got the same result.
