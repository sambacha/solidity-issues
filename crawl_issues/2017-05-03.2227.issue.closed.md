# [\#2227 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2227) `closed`: MacOS 10.9 error: chosen constructor is explicit in copy-initialization

I had an issue with build failing for the release branch of solidity on MacOS 10.9.5 

The error I got:
*$ cmake .. && make
...
error: 
      expected '(' for function-style cast or type construction
  ...const*> const& _seen = std::set<VariableDeclaration const*> const{}*

I wrote in a fix to ./libsolidity/analysis/PostTypeChecker.h that allowed it to compile. If interested I have the change @ https://github.com/egalleye/solidity/blob/release/libsolidity/analysis/PostTypeChecker.h

Thanks, this seems to be the proper fix! Can you create a pull request out of your develop branch? @roadriverrail can help you if you experience difficulties.
