This depends on #2361.

This can generate very primitive (almost compliant) wasm code now:
```
======= wasm.asm (eWasm) =======

Pretty printed source:
{
    function mul(a:u64, b:u64) -> c:u64
    {
    }
    function main() -> y:u64
    {
        let x:u64 := mul(1:u64, 2:u64)
        y := add64(1:u64, 2:u64)
    }
}

Binary representation:
No binary representation found.

Text representation:
(module 
    (func $mul 
        (param $a i64)
        (param $b i64)
        (result i64)
        (local $c i64)
        (return $c)
    )
    (func $main 
        (result i64)
        (local $y i64)
        (local $x i64)
        (set_local $x 
            (call $mul
                 (i64.const 1)
                 (i64.const 2)
            )
        )
        (set_local $y 
            (i64.add 
                (i64.const 1)
                (i64.const 2)
            )
        )
        (return $y)
    )
)
```

Above, `add64` is a builtin function which translates to `i64.add`.

@chriseth can you review this? The `IndentedWriter` could be merged separately too (it could also move to `libdevcore`).

As an experiment we could rewrite this from scratch, just ignore types and assume everything is 64 bit. @axic wanted to work on that.
