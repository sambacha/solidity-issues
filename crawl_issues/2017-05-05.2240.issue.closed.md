Currently it's a bit bare, could definitely use some example of the piping and passing in of different inputs.

What kind of examples do you think of?

I would imagine some string passing of json input and retrieving outputs?

Isn't that documented?

What level of detail is needed in an example? How many examples are needed? What features have to be covered?

Alternatively if you could submit a PR with examples that would help ðŸ˜‰
