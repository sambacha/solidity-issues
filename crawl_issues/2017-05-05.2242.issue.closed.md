Presently, Solidity warns about unused locals when a local or function argument is used only in an inline assembly block.

Mist do not let to deploy a contract from source code because of this warning. I found a way to bypass it: `_myAddress = _myAddress;`. Just assign variable to itself.

Hey. This line is giving me the Unused local variable message inside of mist, and I can't figure out how to get around it:--->

  var _ = admin.call.gas(GAS_LIMIT).value(this.balance)();

How would I do it?
