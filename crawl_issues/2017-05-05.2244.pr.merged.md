# [\#2244 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2244) `merged`: Support tuple assignment in inline assembly

This only support a single right hand side and variable number of left hand side variables.

The analysis checks whether the number of deposited items match the required ones.

Do we want to support multiple right hand side items?

I would not want to support "multiple right hand sides". The only reason of existence for this syntactical construct is to handle functions returning multiple values. Introducing tuple expressions would complicated the language.

This is missing assignment, only support variable declaration.
