Added links to terminology that may not be understood by lay readers.

Minor grammatical changes.

This sentence was a bit confusing due to changing from it to they: "Contracts cannot access log data after it has been created, but they can be efficiently accessed from outside the blockchain.", however changing it to the following may sound awkward "Contracts cannot access log data after log data has been created, but log data can be efficiently accessed from outside the blockchain."
