# [\#2260 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2260) `closed`: Explicit throw raises invalid opcode

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/481465?v=4" width="50">[frangio](https://github.com/frangio) opened issue at [2017-05-10 18:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2260):

The explicit `throw` in the following code results in an invalid opcode exception in solidity >=0.4.10. 
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;
contract Test {
    function test() {
        throw;
    }
}
```

Is this the new expected behavior? It's not documented in the changelog. In fact, the last relevant entry (0.4.9) says: "Invalid jump is still kept for explicit throws".

`throw` uses the `revert` opcode internally (which is an invalid opcode before Metropolis).

Seems like we have missed to mention this in the changelog for 0.4.10, but it is part of the documentation: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/control-structures.html#exceptions

I see. Thanks.
