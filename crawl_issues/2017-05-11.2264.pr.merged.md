# [\#2264 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2264) `merged`: Refactor error reporting

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614752?u=1565826f2b2d74054639e6500236b073aa10f81a&v=4" width="50">[roadriverrail](https://github.com/roadriverrail) opened issue at [2017-05-11 13:31](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2264):

Every component in Solidity was effectively carrying its own implementation
of error( ) and warning( ).  This commit consolidates those implementations
into an ErrorReporter class which can operate on an ErrorList.  ErrorLists
are passed around by reference so that you can make a new ErrorReporter while
sharing common ErrorLists.

Left to do:

1) It hasn't been tested very well yet, but it "seems to work"
2) Really, there are objects being sent ErrorList& that probably could use an
   ErrorReporter& (NameAndTypeResolver is an example), but I haven't gotten
   to those yet

Note:

You need to run `cmake .` in order to update your makefiles to find the new
ErrorReporter sources.

This resolves issue #2209

I think we could consider merging `ErrorList` and `ErrorReporter`.

Purely for the record, I got asked to WIP this so we could start getting it
considered.  I apologize in advance if I left in debug logging or
commented-out stuff; I rushed it off.

Hm.  Somehow a commit got swallowed up.  Anyway, rewrite the fixes in question and re-pushed.

Rebased this off `origin/develop`, which should hopefully fix the build breaks.

Because of C++'s multiple inheritance I don't fully agree with the reasoning about using inheritance for mixins, but if you have a strong reason, I'm fine with keeping it as it is now.
But please add helper functions for the various error types, at least those that are used from multiple files, because otherwise we will have duplication all over the place again.

At this point, this is enough to cover the code replication that was going on through the compiler and different analyzers.  I see some code where `NameAndTypeResolver` and some other classes put errors directly into `ErrorLists`, and I'll get them moved over to using the `ErrorReporter`, too.  I have some day job work to do, but might get to it tomorrow morning.

I think I've hunted down and rooted out all the parts of the code that were making Errors and pushing into their own ErrorLists at this point.  Tests looked good on my laptop, and it didn't break any of my own personal and casual tests.

Also please rebase so that it picks up the bytecodecompare fix.

Sorry about the comments regarding fatal errors, I only looked at a single commit.

Can you please rebase?

This was rebased as of when it was pushed.  I'll rebase again after we sort out the headers issue.

The fuzzer test is breaking because this code:

```
        contract C {
            uint8[] tester; 
            function f() returns (uint8[5]) {
                return ([1,2,3,4,5]);
            }
            function test() returns (uint8, uint8, uint8, uint8, uint8) {
                tester = f(); 
                return (tester[0], tester[1], tester[2], tester[3], tester[4]);
            }
             
        }
```

Is resulting in a `Fatal error: Type "uint8[]" not supported for state variable`.  This was a fatal error in the `Why3Translator`.  This would have been fatal in the code before the move to `ErrorReporter`, so I don't know how that test would have passed in the first place.

Okay.  I think I've captured all the previous style comments, restored the use of the three flags that I'd gotten rid of, and done a clean rebase.

I wonder if it would make sense adding a forward declaration in the headers and not using the entire `ErrorReporter` include? It doesn't seem to use any method off it, just an opaque reference.

I have no problem with using forward declarations for `ErrorReporter` in the headers.  Should I start a `libsolidity/interface/ErrorReporterForward.h` for that?

Never mind.  I see we do a lot of manual forward declares already.

The sad thing is that this actually builds on my machine even after a `make clean`.

But it should be a `struct`.  Pushing...
