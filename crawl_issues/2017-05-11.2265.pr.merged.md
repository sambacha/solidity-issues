# [\#2265 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2265) `merged`: Analyze InlineAssembly for variable use

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614752?u=1565826f2b2d74054639e6500236b073aa10f81a&v=4" width="50">[roadriverrail](https://github.com/roadriverrail) opened issue at [2017-05-11 15:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2265):

The unused variable checker in StaticAnalyzer did not conssider
InlineAssembly objects.  This commit introduces that missing feature.

This resolves issue #2242, #2249, #2251.

There seems to be some kind of failure:

```

I'm not familiar with the fuzzer, and I'm not sure how to see the source that broke it.  I see the `solAssert()` that caused the crash, though.

My first guess is that the input in question had an `assembly { }` block outside of a function definition, which then left `m_localVarUseCount( )` from being empty.  I could fix that by adding  an `m_currentFunction` check, but I'd love to know for sure that I'm describing the issue correctly.

The fuzzer test extracts all the cases form the `test` directory and runs the tool on it. There's no actual fuzzing happening :)

The fuzzer is used by an external tool which actually passes it fuzzed sources.

I think you'd need to have a copy of the analysis annotation otherwise multiple invocations will result in the above. I might be wrong though.

Hunh.  I thought I'd seen that happen without my changes in place, too.  Will re-investigate.

I was able to get around the issue by feeding in a fresh `AsmAnalysisInfo` when calling the function, so the analysis that gets run isn't being run with the state of prior analyses.  It simulates the state that's present when `TypeChecker` uses the `AsmAnalyzer`, but without interfering with any existing state.  I think this works, but the inline asm stuff is new to me.

@chriseth You know, I think that you're right.  I had previously rejected this idea because I thought that `ExternalIdentifierInfo` couldn't be used this way, since it references a `Declaration` with no clear indication that the `Declaration` was for a variable.  I didn't appreciate that I can do an `if (auto var = ...` and it'll naturally filter things that don't fit the `dynamic_cast` demands correctly.  Let me rewrite this and see if I can have it ready in time for today's meeting.

@axic Roger that.  I'll get it out as soon as I can.  Funny, because I
bothered to reorder them. :)

Not sure if this is related. 

But when using the code found here - https://www.ethereum.org/crowdsale

the first line does not seem to work too well...

contract token { function transfer(address receiver, uint amount){  } }

The following error is returned:

 Could not compile source code. 

 Unused local variable
contract token { function transfer(address receiver, uint amount){  } }
                                                     ^---------^
, 

not sure what the problem maybe.. I even changed the word "token" to something else and still get an error...
