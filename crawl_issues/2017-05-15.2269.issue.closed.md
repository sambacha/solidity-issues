Solidity 0.4.11
Explained in detail here:
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/16165/1328

In a nutshell, call encodes dynamic arrays as fixed arrays, omitting length prefixes.

This came up in #2226 too. I think we could argue whether it should do:
a) the entire ABI encoding or
b) the encoding as of today and let the user control the structure.

Currently it encodes the shortest way possible, that kind of doesn't matches with a) anyway.

Also a longer discussion is at #1707. See `encode.calldata(sig, varargs)`.

Perhaps we can just wait for the #1707 to be implemented, and update documentation on `address.call`.

Functions like `call` and `sha3` do specifically not use the full ABI encoding. Yes, we should more clearly document that.

The behaviour of those functions has changed in 0.5.0 and it is now properly documented.
