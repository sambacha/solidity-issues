# [\#2275 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2275) `merged`: Add RETURNDATACOPY and RETURNDATASIZE to assembly (and LLL)

This PR adds RETURNDATACOPY and RETURNDATASIZE in LLL so that Metropolis tests in `etheruem/tests` can be developed more easily.  In passing, I added minimum documentation and tests about inline assembly.

It is also missing the changelog entry and the optimiser changes (GasMeter, SemanticInformation).

I think I updated everything.

I think we should have warnings in place if using these Metropolis instructions. This applies to `CREATE` and `STATICCALL` too.

Added warnings to the analyzer, will push it later the evening.

Please add a warning if in the scope of an inline assembly block there is a solidity identifier called `returndatasize`.

Please add a test that
```
contract c { function f() { uint returndatasize; assembly { returndatasize }}}
```
creates an additional warning about returndatasize not being available as a variable name in inline assembly anymore.

@chriseth <del>I'll do this in two to three weeks.</del> It seems I can do this next week already `taskwarrior` considers this somewhat important maybe because I added `metropolis` tag.

I realized #2149 depends on this.  Hurrying up.

@chriseth after doing a straight forward thing, the warning you wanted is consumed in `errorsIgnored` reporter defined in `bool ReferencesResolver::visit(InlineAssembly const& _inlineAssembly)`.

Do you remember the reason for throwing away errors there?

@pirapira The warnings are ignored because at that stage, the access to external identifiers does not yet have the type information and because of that, it has to wait until the type checker phase and re-run again.

The warning that is currently in the code should be re-generate again when it is run in the type checker.

The warning I wanted (not that it is a different thing) can be added in the references resolver and would just check at every point where we have inline assembly whether there is some variable named `returndatasize`. This increases the false positive rate, but I think that is acceptable.

@chriseth the warning I'm adding does not re-generate in the type-checking mode.  It only appears in the reference resolving phase.  In the type-checking mode, from `AsmAnalyze.cpp`, I cannot look up the Solidity variable.

I think, this particular warning belongs to the reference resolving phase, not type checking phase.  This is just about variable names and scoping, not about types.  So I will try to remove the dummy errorReporter, and inhibit duplicates with other means.

Or, I should change the code so that the warning re-generates in the typing phase.

@chriseth do you remember the reason why
```
m_resolver(identifier, julia::IdentifierContext::LValue);  // in AsmAnalysis.cpp
```
behaves differently in the reference resolving phase and the type checking phase?

Currently, `m_resolver` finds the Solidity variable `returndatacopy` in the reference resolving phase but not in the type checking phase.

@chriseth I added the test and implemented the warning.

Can you please squash some commits? The "fix typo" commit only fixed the code and there will be another one fixing the tests ðŸ˜‰ 

Could be merged into the original commit.
