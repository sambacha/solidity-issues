This changes allows using the Boost Test --log_level parameter to see RCP requests and responses. the feature can be seen by running:

./soltest --log_level=message -- --ipcpath /tmp/testeth/geth.ipc

This was very valuable in getting details on why RPC tests were failing when executing soltest against the latest version of cpp-ethereum.

We also have an option `--show-messages` but I think this one here might even be more boosty ;-)
