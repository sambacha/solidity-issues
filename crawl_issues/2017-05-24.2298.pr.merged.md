There is still another case in `convertType` using the invalid opcode.

Also assembly, sourcelocation and bytecode tests are failing.

Also need to document in http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/control-structures.html#exceptions that it is thrown if a method is not found and no fallback is defined.

Concerning the type conversion cases: One of them is integer to enum conversion which (for what I have seen in the code) will not be used for parsing input arguments as there, we only have `convertType(type, type, true)`.

Pending work:
 - [x] update documentation around exceptions
 - [x] clarify description of require and assert / revert and invalid opcode
 - [x] fix tests

Finished from my side (as long as travis agrees).

Needs rebase (also just in case any other merged changes would change tests).

@axic can this be merged?

@chriseth see comment above about rebase ðŸ˜‰

@axic I think travis runs the tests on the merged commit and not on the pull request tip, but I might be wrong. Rebasing.

Ah, it already was rebased.

@chriseth tests are failing :(

Ok, this was hopefully the final fix.
