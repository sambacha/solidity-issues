```
Compiling all test contracts into bytecode...
Running for commit a411bae73c46b29b5573f05bf6eb73d841da3f19
```

But the top commit of this branch is `e12b9900380780d2fb3edab21cbfabdc45ecfdfe`. Where is that commit coming form?

Update: Travis merges the pull request into "master" and that is the merge commit.

Still weird that for some of branches this works, for others it doesn't.

Yes, it is a merge commit. But why is it not available? Shall we just use HEAD, because that is also what we use for compiling, right?

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. However when clicking on the commit in travis it does exists on Github, so not sure what is going on. HEAD should work though in all cases.
