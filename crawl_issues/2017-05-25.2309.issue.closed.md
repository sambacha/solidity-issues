It suggests using GCC-Bridge to compile C/C++ to Java:

The goal here is to make it possible to compile solidity from Java?

Well, I do have some good jvm and jni chops...

The issue discussed in the original thread was being able to compile Solidity contracts from a JVM toolchain as easily as you currently can from Node.js, right? So perhaps there is no need to provide a full JNI interface to the C++ API. As long as a JVM app can fork to a native `solc` executable and read it's standard JSON output (perhaps with a thin Java wrapper to make things nice) it should be fine.

I mention this because those platform-dependent Maven builds may be easier to create and maintain than a full JNI bridge.

Note, `GCC-Bridge` above is like Emscripten, it compiles C/C++ (actually compiles GCC's Gimple IR) to Java bytecode. It wouldn't be JNI or executing an application, rather native code.

There are two steps to this:
- build a GCC-Bridge docker and tie it into a Travis build step
- ensure the `jsonCompiler` API (at least `compileStandard`) is exported in Java and works (this might need a tiny wrapper to convert between native types of Java, such as `String`)

Did a little bit of a feasibility study on this tonight.  I cloned Renjin and built it to get a copy of gcc-bridge.  gcc-bridge appears to work in two steps.  The first step transforms GCC intermediate language into JSON via a GCC plugin.  The second step takes the JSON files and attempts to generate Java classes that have equivalent semantics.

I modified the CXX_FLAGS to load the plugin.  Unforunately, the plugin only works for gcc 4.7 (and I think gcc 4.6).  gcc 4.7 is older than gcc's full C++11 support.  We can't build jsoncpp on that.  Even after I modified the build system to use my usual gcc (5.4) for jsoncpp, it's not enough.  We have build breaks in `NameAndTypeResolver.cpp` , `RPCSession.cpp` and `AsmPrinter.cpp`.  The `NameAndTypeResolver.cpp` and `RPCSession.cpp` breaks are probably a simple fix, but the `AsmPrinter.cpp` break appears to actually be caused by using a copy of boost that wants gcc > 4.7.

Even if we elected to fix these breaks, we'd basically be forcing ourselves to stay pre-C++11 in order to keep up gcc-bridge.  Unless, of course, gcc-bridge were to support newer compilers.

@axic asked for more detail of the errors.  I guess since then there was something that changed in our json-cpp dependency, since it no longer compiles under gcc-4.7:

@roadriverrail that's weird because we only use a fixed version of jsoncpp, which hasn't changed in a while.

@axic it may have been that I somehow didn't previously clean up my build
cruft or had shoehorned in gcc use.  This is somewhat consistent with my
prior experience with json-cpp, though, because I recently did a port of it
for my day job, and it expected full C++11, including gcc >= 4.9.

There weren't many asks for such a feature over the years, so I think it is safe to close it.
