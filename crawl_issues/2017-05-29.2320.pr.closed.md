# [\#2320 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2320) `closed`: [WIP] Solidity to Yul compiler

I had this prototype lying around, it is not very useful, but we could at least discuss the interface design here (and either finish it or close it).

It might help to keep closer to the current code. Perhaps it makes sense to extract some code from CompilerContext.cpp or ContractCompiler.cpp that can be shared between the two modes.

This has actually two different interfaces, one like the why3 translator (I'd drop it) and the other returns an AssemblyStack (I like this better).

@axic I think we should have a call about this. Not sure if AssemblyStack is the right thing to return, I would prefer if it returned either a string or the Julia AST.

I had the AST (`assembly::Block`) initially (it is still there). Though the question is which side would need to do the analyzer call?

Initially I liked printing it as a string and let the other side/process it as the analysis and the validity is clear in that case. The downside I see is the source locations cannot be carried over, which might be a nice feature (pointing to which Solidity expression broke it).

My idea (not sure if that is written down somewhere) is to have source locations as part of special comments. The `location` field in the Julia AST is actually meant to be used for that (it only refers to the assembly source if it was not generated from solidity). There is already a source location printer in Assembly.cpp:172 which prints it in this format, only the parser is missing.

That was my alternative solution too:
```
{
  ///@location Sample.sol:33,50
  let x := loadCalldata(1)
  ...
}
```

Printing only makes it extremely simple to support inline assembly blocks :wink:

```
contract A {
  function f() {
    assembly {
      let x:= 1
      pop(mul(1, 2))
    }
    assembly {
      let y := 5
      y := mulmod(y, 4, 3)
    }
  }
  function g() {
    throw;
  }
}
```

to

```
{
    function f()
    {
        {
            let x := 1
            pop(mul(1, 2))
        }
        {
            let y := 5
            y := mulmod(y, 4, 3)
        }
    }
    function g()
    {
        revert()
    }
}
```

Regarding interfaces we have agreed to:
- [x] place the code into `libsolidity/codegen/julia/Compiler.cpp` (or `libsolidity/frontend/julia`?)
- [x] return `assembly::Block` from the compiler
- [ ] add a flag to `CompilerStack` to select which frontends to run ("standard", julia or both)
- [ ] run all the selected frontends in `compile()`
- [x] include `assemblyStack()` in the `CompilerStack` returning the data from the Julia frontend or throw if it was not selected
- [ ] add a flag to `object()`, `runtimeObject()`, etc. to select which frontend to use, defaults to "standard" if it was selected initially for `compile()` (Note: in julia mode it selects EVM as a backend)
- [x] support multiple contracts in the IR
- [x] use `solUnimplementedAssert` instead of `JuliaCompilerError`
- [x] add CLI option `--ir`

Would it be easier from an implementation perspective if `compile()` just took a flag about which backend to use and then it would fill a `map` from the backend to the compilation results? If you want multiple backends, you call compile another time and the map would get another entry. The `object()`, `runtimeObject()` and other functions would just query that map.

Directories: I think we agreed to use `libsolidity/codegen/julia` because the frontend of a compile is more than just IR-codegen.

@chriseth seems we're going with `codegen/ir/IRGenerate.cpp` and `codegen/ir/IRGenerateExpression.cpp` ?

This needs tests.

Hi @axic @chriseth just wondering about the status of this PR. A few of us at SRI International are interested in verification, and we think that Julia/Yul IR might be ideal for our tools. The main thing thatâ€™s missing for us is the translation from Solidity, whose skeleton is part of this PR.

Will work on this be continued? Any idea of a timeline? Are you in need of contributors?

@michael-emmi sorry, no timeline yet. We will probably first translate all the interior routines to yul and then rewrite the contract compiler. If you want to help, you could rewrite some routines inside ArrayUtils.cpp using yul / whiskers.
