I think we agreed to: (comments in #2233)
- keep `assemble()`, but return an empty object if it is not supported by the backend
- introduce `assembly()` to return a text assembly or empty string if not supported by the backend
- rename `AssemblyStack` to `BackendStack`

@chriseth so this means we are going with this version of the API and not having two methods? If so feel free to merge.
