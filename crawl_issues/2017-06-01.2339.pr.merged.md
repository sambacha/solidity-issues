# [\#2339 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2339) `merged`: Silence implicit fallthrough warning

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1658405?v=4" width="50">[LefterisJP](https://github.com/LefterisJP) opened issue at [2017-06-01 14:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2339):

Fixes #2344.

In my system I have gcc 7.1.1 and there I get a lot of warnings which
fail the build due to implicit fallthroughs in switch statements.

Some examples can be seen here:
https://gist.github.com/LefterisJP/388c3ba5ad356f92a3b44e7efed89f9f

This PR proposes a simple solution, which is to ignore the warning for
both gcc and clang since implici fallthrough is actively used in the codebase and don;t know of a way to locally ignore it on a case by case basis.

@chriseth 

I am also not in favour of disabling them but this is the easiest solution that I used locally (to have solc again) temporarily until I bring the matter to your attention.

>  How many of them are there? 

There were quite a few cases.

There is no standard way to disable them locally. According to [this](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/10/wimplicit-fallthrough-in-gcc-7/) we can use the following non-standard ways:

```c++
switch (cond)
 {
 case 1:
   bar (1);
   __attribute__ ((fallthrough)); // C and C++03
 case 2:
   bar (2);
   [[gnu::fallthrough]]; // C++11 and C++14
 case 3:
   bar (3);
   [[fallthrough]]; // C++17 and above
 /* ... */
 }
```

You can also tweak the level of fallthrough ranging from `-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0` to `-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3`.

I am not sure what you guys think is the best for the codebase as it stands now but I suggest having a look at the aforementioned article and taking a decision depending on the seriousness (or lack of) of the places where the warning hits.

@chriseth I opted for the C++03 way as per our discussion. Let's hope all the tests pass.

It seems the compilers do not accept it. I read in some non-standard documents that this is part of C++03, but perhaps that is wrong?

Since we only have two such cases, would it make sense reordering the code so that it is not falling through?

If there are only two, then yes, indeed.

@LefterisJP would you be able to do the change above?

Refactored the code.

@axic these changes really look dangerous. I think we should just disable the warning until we have  gcc7 as part of our CI.

I tend to agree. I would do the following:

1. Disable the warning with this PR.
2. Create a new issue as a followup detailing that these particular code points need to be refactored and the warning re-enabled.

@LefterisJP if you could do that, this would be wonderful!
