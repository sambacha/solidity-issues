# [\#2340 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2340) `closed`: Should warn for unreachable code

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-06-02 20:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2340):

```
contract C {
  function f() {
    uint a = 1;
    throw;
    a = 5; // unreachable code
  }
}
```

Perhaps this fits the static analyzer in browser-solidity better.

This should also be able to deal with `modifier mod(){ return; _; }`

Another possibility-- I need to do control flow analysis for the compile-time overflow checks.  If we have control-flow analysis, then unreachable code detection shouldn't be hard.

@ekpyron can't we do that now?

Added to 0.5.1 queue.

@chriseth Yes, that's possible with the control flow graph in most cases - it would work in the example above. But it's a non-breaking change, so I agree to put it into 0.5.1.

We could also detect some branch conditions like comparisons with constants.
