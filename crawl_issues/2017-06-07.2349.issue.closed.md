# [\#2349 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2349) `closed`: Warn if a decimal literals are used in a bytesXX context.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-06-07 17:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2349):

`bytesXX` types are left-aligned (i.e. right-padded with zeros), which is intuitive for things like `bytes32 a = "abcdef";`, but it is less intuitive for `bytes32 a = 7;`. After all, `bytesXX` types are not really meant to be used for decimal numbers anyway. We should issue a warning whenever a decimal literal is used in a `bytesXX` context.
