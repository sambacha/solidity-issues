# [\#2354 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2354) `merged`: LLL: fix handling of "sha3" expression

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20796281?u=3ade059256c951779e598bb585d7d85463f340a3&v=4" width="50">[benjaminion](https://github.com/benjaminion) opened issue at [2017-06-08 14:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2354):

When PR #2317 changed the EVM opcode from SHA3 to KECCAK256 it broke the `(sha3 loc len)` expression in LLL. This PR fixes things while allowing existing code using the sha3 expression (such as the ENS registrar) to continue to compile.  I.e. both `(keccak256 loc len)` and `(sha3 loc len)` may be used, and the existing related sha3 macros continue to work.

Can you please add an end to end test for both `keccak256` and `sha3`? That should have caught this in the first place ðŸ˜‰

Three test cases added:

 - kekkac256
 - sha3 macro with 2 args
 - sha3 macro with 1 arg

@benjaminion can you please rebase this? (Since the other LLL changes were merged this is in conflict.)

@axic 

Rebase done. Should be good - all LLL tests succeed.

@benjaminion would you be interested adding tests for every internal macro in a separate PR? It would be nice catching these errors when we make changes ðŸ˜‰

@axic 

> would you be interested adding tests for every internal macro in a separate PR?

Sure. It'll be a week or two, but happy to take this one.
