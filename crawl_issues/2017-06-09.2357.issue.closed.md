I am not reporting on a bug with Solidity, but with an issue on readthedocs here:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/layout-of-source-files.rst#version-pragma

"It is possible to specify much more complex rules for the compiler version, the expression follows those used by npm."

This is vague, providing more information would be better.
