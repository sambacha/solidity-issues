# [\#2358 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2358) `closed`: Warn if `for (var i = 0; ...)` is used

This is a common pitfalls because type deduction will assign the type `unt8` to `i`, which will probably lead to problems with overflow and the for condition.

Is there a case where type deduction is good and doesn't lead to errors like this?

@illuzen Contract referencing comes to mind. But even that has some pitfalls (which I believe are being addressed as we speak).

It was useful before function types were added. Less useful now.

I think this is quite important, as the question comes up again and again. Will implement.
