# [\#2364 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2364) `merged`: Bring ABI Spec Into Solidity Documentation

The following is a simple attempt to bring major components from the main Ethereum wiki into the solidity docs for easier viewing and general awareness when making an update to the ABI (since Solidity is basically the flagship language of the technology that is Ethereum). Currently am trying to make sure that my .rst is on point (I doubt it is), and trying to make some edits, with particular attention paid to:

- events
- fixed points
- structs
- timestamps
- enums

As these are currently, or are planned to be a part of the spec.

@VoR0220 I would propose to finalize this PR first and then improve the wording / extend it in a subsequent PR. What do you think?

Yea. Do you think prior to this commit it would be nearly ready to finalize? What else do we have to knock out? Maybe better indexing?

@VoR0220 yes, the intent was to take the wiki page, add structs and merge this into the documentation. Later, we can improve the wording.
