# [\#2365 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2365) `closed`: Variable locations are wrongly calculated in Julia assembler
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
{
  let x := 1

  jump(label)

  let y := 2
  
label:
  let z := x
}
```

The location of `x` is calculated wrongly, because the other declarations between the jump and label are also taken into account.

`z` should be `dup1`, but is generated as `dup2`. If `let y` is removed it results in `dup1`.

This can also be reproduced in inline assembly:
```
contract C {
  function f() returns (uint a) {
    assembly {
      let x := 1

      jump(label)

      let y := 2
  
    label:
      let z := x
      
      a := z
    }
  }
}
```

This is a documented downside of using a raw `jump`. To fix it, we should ban raw jumps and labels.

At the bare minimum we need a warning displayed. The warning in the documentation is quite hidden.

You are proposing to show a warning whenever labels are used instead of banning them (at least for the next release)?

Note that such a warning can only be silenced by changing to switch and for.

Well labels are not doing anything, but jump instructions are. Ideally it should warn if a variable declaration is within a block jumped over, but it is way easier to simply warn on a jump instruction.

I think it is a good way to prepare for deprecation of inline assembly in favour of Julia.
