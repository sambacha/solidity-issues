Should `{ x: 1, y: 2, }` be valid or should we restrict the parser?

It makes the diff cleaner when we remove the last element from here
```
  {
    x : 1,
-   y : 2,
  }
```

If we don't allow the trailing comma, the comma after `x` needs to be removed, and the diff looks more complicated.
```
  {
-   x : 1,
-   y : 2
+   x : 1
  }
```


Another solution is the Haskell way, but that's not popular:
```
  { x : 1
- , y : 2
  }
```

Commas are separators, semicolons are terminators, so I would not introduce optional trailing commas. Plus, trailing commas actually have a meaning in tuples and tuple match expressions.

Oh, I thought it was expected behavior. I find trailing commas usually comfortable and I don't think they clash with the tuple case, but it ultimately comes down to the feel you want to give to the language.

Ah thanks for the pointer to the source code! In this case, I would prefer to change the source code, actually. Trailing commas have a meaning at other parts of the code, so I would not want to introduce flexibility here.

I created an issue about forbidding the trailing comma: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2385

Thanks @federicobond for noticing the inconsistency between the code and the documentation.
