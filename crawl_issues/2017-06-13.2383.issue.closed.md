# [\#2383 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2383) `closed`: Issue with UTF-8 failing to decode hex bytes
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2017-06-13 16:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2383):

Given the following raw hex string:<br>
`public constant notValid = hex"F09FA684";`
Solidity throws the following error:  

> Type literal_string (contains invalid UTF-8 sequence at position 3) is not implicitly convertible to
> expected type string memory.

However, given the valid series of UTF-8 encoded bytes `\xF0\x9F\xA6\x84`, Solidity should decode it to get the unicorn emoji: ðŸ¦„, a valid UTF-8 decoded character.

You can verify the desired behavior [here](https://mothereff.in/utf-8),
entering \xF0\x9F\xA6\x84 into the **UTF-8-encoded** box.<br>
This issue was discovered as the result of a StackExchange question, which you can find [here](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/17670/solidity-and-the-mystery-of-the-unicode-unicorn) .<br>

Solidity 0.4.11
