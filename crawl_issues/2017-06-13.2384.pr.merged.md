So far my understanding was that every instruction can be written in functional notation. This changes that into only instructions which take no arguments can be written in non-functional notation.

I think this may be a breaking change.

If we are doing a breaking change, I'd rather just prefer eliminating:
- non-functional notation altogether
- literal pushes to the stack

I hope this is not a breaking change, at least on my machine, the tests did not break. Note that this change only applies to the `parseExpression` function which is only invoked if we already are in a functional context like in `let x := <...>` or `mul(<...>, 2)`.

Clarified.
