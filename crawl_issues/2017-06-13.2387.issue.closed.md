# [\#2387 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2387) `closed`: Yul: return variable scoping

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-06-13 19:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2387):

```
{
  let x:u256 := 1:u256
  function f() -> x:u256
  {
    x := 42:u256
  }
  x := f()
}
```

This fails with:
```
scope.jl:3:3: Error: Variable name x already taken in this scope.
  function f() -> x:u256
  ^
```

I think the return values are in the scope of the function body and therefore should be allowed.

Yes, and this is by design. We might lift the shadowing rules a bit, but you could also use the following code:

```
{
  function f() -> x:u256
  {
    x := 42:u256
  }
  {
    let x:u256 := 1:u256
    x := f()
  }
}
```

I'm closing this, this is just an effect of the strict shadowing rules.
