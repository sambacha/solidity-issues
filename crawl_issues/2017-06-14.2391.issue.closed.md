I'm sorry, but we cannot provide detailed support for all distributions. This script mostly relies on the community to provide feedback.

Can you check what `g++` and `boost-devel` versions do you have installed? Perhaps newer CentOS versions don't need a new one installed.

@chriseth I'm on it and trying to install the many dependencies. I will put a PR if I succeed.

@axic  Yeah,  I've installed boost 1.53.0 but the precheck script told me it's too old. I'll upgrade it and see if it works.
