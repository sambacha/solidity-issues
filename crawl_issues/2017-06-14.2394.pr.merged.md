# [\#2394 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2394) `merged`: Support shl/shr in LLL

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-06-14 11:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2394):

This will be replaced by native shift operators once they are supported in EVM (EIP145).

Note: with the optimiser enabled, this is optimised to a constant div/mul (or even to a constant literal if both sides are literals).

What do you think @zigguratt @benjaminion ?

Yes, good with me.  Would be useful for the ubiquitous (div foo (exp 2 224)) expression.

I haven't explored the optimizer yet - I'll have to look into it. On the face of it (shl foo 4) would be a very expensive way to multiply by 16.  But as a soft entry to using the eventual opcodes, this is fine.

@zigguratt @benjaminion I hope at some point EIP145 will be implemented and this becomes even better :)
