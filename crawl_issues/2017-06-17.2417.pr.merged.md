(r s v hash) -> (hash v r s) which corresponds to the order that the built-in EVM contract uses.

This ought not affect any existing code - it's just a relabelling. The existing labelling is quite wrong.

Test case included, based on the [example code](https://gist.github.com/axic/5b33912c6f61ae6fd96d6c4a47afde6d) by @axic.
