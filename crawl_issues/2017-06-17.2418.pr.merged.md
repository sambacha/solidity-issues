# [\#2418 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2418) `merged`: LLL: Full set of test cases for the built-in compiler macros.

As per @axic's suggestion.

I've basically considered only happy flows, but the coverage should be reasonable. An improvement, anyway.

Note,
 - test msg_six_args will fail to compile until Issue #2400 is dealt with.
 - tests create_one_arg and create_two_args will fail until PR #2415 is merged.

Note too that PR #2417 also contains the ecrecover test and #2415 also contains tests that are in here. So some rebasing will be needed at some point depending on what's merged and when. Let me know.

I think we could:
- merge #2417
- fix & merge #2415
- comment out `msg_six_args` and merge this PR
- start a new PR fixing set/get/ref and enabling `msg_six_args`

The test cases look good, so I am in favour merging it (following the plan above I guess).

Also happy that writing these tests uncovered some bugs.

Once #2439 is merged, this can be rebased.

Having looked at `msg_six_args` I think it will fail as it doesn't seem correct. It will need to be fixed as part of this PR perhaps.

Yes, I'm working on it now.  TBH, I can't fathom out the original `msg` with 6 args macro at all - I've rewritten it along the lines of the create macros (i.e. with no `alloc`) and it works fine with my original test code. I'm deeply suspicious of the `alloc` built-in; I can't figure it out at all.

I think I'll submit a proposed new `msg` macro as a separate PR, and we can deal with that. Then the final commit of all the test cases can be nice and clean.

So you want to comment the test out in this PR and fix it in a separete one?

I'm shortly going to send a PR for teh `msg_six_args` macro with its own test code. Let's decide first what to do with that, and afterwards I'll rebase this PR and it should all merge nice and cleanly.

Rebased. All tests working against current develop branch.

Hmm. Cannot reproduce.

Compiler version:

```
build> clang --version
clang version 4.0.0-1ubuntu1 (tags/RELEASE_400/rc1)
Target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin
```

Confirmation Cmake is using this version (clean build done):

```
build> cmake -D_CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=llvm- ..
-- The C compiler identification is Clang 4.0.0
-- The CXX compiler identification is Clang 4.0.0

```

Test output:

```

Travis uses:

clang version 3.5.0 (tags/RELEASE_350/final)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

And it fails on `makeperm`.

Yes. It smells like a compiler bug in that version of clang since v4.0.0 and all the other compilers are ok.

Shall we remove the makeperm test until this can be addressed? I don't think there's anything wrong with the test itself. What do you advise?

I can reproduce it on:

Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.38)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0

Added some debugging and it results in:

[dev::tag_comment*] = Expected 1 items, but deposited 0

at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/liblll/CodeFragment.cpp#L427.

We should figure out why it fails, need to leave now, but will check later again.

So it came down to this example:
```
(perm 'x)
```

Which in turn simplified out it to:
```
(def 'permcount (+ permcount 1))
```

And the bug was:
```
_s.defs[n] = CodeFragment(i, _s);
```

Where `_s.defs[n]` was updated before executing `CodeFragment` and thus the `permcount` lookup resulted in an empty item in the `+`.

@benjaminion can you rebase this on #2462 so we can see this branch passes all tests? (We need to rebase again to develop one #2462 is meged though)

Have rebased onto branch lll-fix-def as requested. All tests are succeeding in my environment - we'll see about the travis CI environment...

@benjaminion cool, it seems to have solved the problem for `makeperm` too.
