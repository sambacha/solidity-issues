# [\#2419 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2419) `closed`: Think about giving Inline assembly as parsed AST in AST output

 Does it make more sense to represent the operations as a list of parsed assembly items?

It might, but the assembly grammar is much simpler, so we went this way.

This might be the cleanest solution to the recent issues in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7153#issuecomment-530986932
Since we currently use a pretty printed version of the original inline assembly it's impossible to reconstruct the original source locations of all yul AST nodes during re-import.

The least hacky solution to that problem is probably outputing the yul AST as JSON tree instead of as just a string of operations.

> is probably outputing the yul AST as JSON tree instead of as just a string of operations.

just to be sure i got this correctly: inlineAssembly is a subset of yul. (Or at least it is parsed by the yul::Parser). 

So in broad strokes my idea to approach this would be: 
- 1) define helper functions(or a class?) ```Json::Value AsmConverter::toJson(yul::Literal/Identifier/...)```
- 2) in ASTJsonConverter::visit(InlineAssembly): do 
```["operations"] = AsmJsonConverter::toJson( _node.operations())``` (instead of Printedstring)
  - (AST::InlineAssembly's member m_operations is a yul::Block with the AST in it)

- Questions:
      - this is not using the accept/visit/endvisit-scheme. As I understand this was mostly to be able to do stuff like annotations. But all "Asm-nodes" are structs (see AsmData.h) which should be straightforward to (recreate) and which are not annotated.

It probably makes sense to coordinate this with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7386 (which will change the dialect for inline assembly to "proper yul")

## Problem:

I need to process a *yul::Block*, which is a vector of *Statement*., which is a boost::variant() for manyt hings(yul::Expression, yul::Instruction, yul::Label,....>

So as i understand I can deduce the type of the statement using boost.variant's ```.which```,
but I still don't know how to access the values within that struct.

E.g. if I know that a statement is of type *Instruction*, I still can't call 
statement.instruction. ("no member instruction in boost::variant<Expression, Label,...>).

Can i cast it somehow? 

So, (as I think I can not cast) the solution to get something out of the
boost::variant is to write a dedicated *visitor*, as is done for the location in AsmData.h::lines 86-97

So my idea would be to write one visitor (similar as locationOf) per type of struct in the variant.

#### example, for "VariableDeclaration" 

it is defined like this:
```struct VariableDeclaration { langutil::SourceLocation location; TypedNameList variables; std::unique_ptr<Expression> value; };```

therefore the function (two actually) would be:

```
template <class T> inline std::pair<TypedNameList, Expression> getVariableDeclarationInfo(T const& node) {
   return boost::applyVisitor(VariableDeclarationExtractor(), node) 
}

struct VariableDeclarationExtractor: boost::static_visitor<std::pair<TypedNameList, Expression>{
   {
   template <class T> std::pair<TypedNameList, Expression> operator()(T const& node) const {
        return make_pair(node.variables, node.values)
   }
}
```

This seems like a lot of work. Can you point me to a smarter way to do that?

The question is resolved, right? You just use `boost::apply_visitor`.

Yes. I am confident, that this will solve it.
