# [\#2422 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2422) `closed`: WIP: Update inline assembly grammar

I updated the documented grammar while testing it using the examples provided. There are several differences between the way the implementation works, the pseudocode provided in the documentation and the grammar, so I have followed the implementation when in doubt and made sure it parsed the code examples.

This is meant more as a way to discuss and sync those 3 rather than merge immediately.

I think the grammar should be taken off #2129 (well that PR actually updates everything).

I'll try to get the back to proper shape next week.

Didn't realize that wasn't merged yet! I'll close this then.
