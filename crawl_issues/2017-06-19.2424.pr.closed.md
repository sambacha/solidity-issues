# [\#2424 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2424) `closed`: [WIP] Check for overflow on integer arithmetic

This is, mostly, a starting place and a very rough and very early
work-in-progress for detecting possible arithmetic overflow conditions.
Right now, it works for basic arithmetic and assignment, does not
analyze branches or control structures, and probably works only for
one function in one contract.

Thanks for the pull request!

I think that in general, it would probably make sense to separate the "range" and the "allowed range" aspect, also looking towards a more generalized use of these classes. Furthermore, what happens in a binary operator (unless it is a comparison operator) is that the operands are first converted into the common type and then the operation is performed in that common type. Since these are implicit conversions, the range will always fit, but the overflow will happen in the new type. Also, I think it would be beneficial to have a bounds constructor taking a type object (instead of "number of bytes" and "signed"). This means, the operand visitor would be something like:

```
Bounds b = combineBounds(operand, leftBounds, rightBounds);
if (!b.fits(Bounds(commonType)))
  warning(...).
```

Ah and also note that variables can be used before they are declared, so this basically means that whenever `m_varOverflowInfo` does not contain `&var`, just initialize it with the default range of `var`'s type and you do not have to care about `visit(VariableDeclaration...)` at all.

Rebased and moved on to the helper functions for IntegerType.  Next on my list is to look to more of the design and refactoring remarks from @chriseth because the code is definitely becoming unwieldy to work with.

Other things I feel are coming up on the horizon that I need:

- Something to properly evaluate boolean expressions and determine the set of constraints that can be applied to ensure that it is true or false.  E.g. given the expression (x || y), it returns {{x}, {y}, {x,y}}.  This will be necessary for properly analyzing if/else, require( ), etc.

- Loops.  I have no good ideas about how to handle them.  The potential for overflow with a loop depends strongly on how many times the loop will run before terminating, and I don't have good intuitions about how to handle this.

That said, I do have some sense about how to do some refactoring to get this code cleaner and easier to read, and I also can work on extending this to analyze more than one function, and I can also work on expanding the mathematical operations supported, and so on.

@roadriverrail I have not read all the recent changes, just commenting on your comment above:

I think a simple first version does not require the evaluation of all boolean expression perhaps apart from either simple `&&` or `||`, whichever is more convenient in that situation.

Concerning loops: What you can do is

 - analyze the loop about which local variables it might be affected
 - assume the loop condition inside the body to be true (just like an `if`), but clear all other assumptions about affected local variables
 - after the loop, clear all assumptions about affected local variables (even the loop codition).

@chriseth No worries about all the other comments.  I think your
refactoring to make the range objects immutable is a great idea, and I hope
to take it on either later today or tomorrow morning.  Can you explain what
you mean when you say "clear assumptions"?  If I "clear assumptions" from a
particular value range, am I basically returning it to [minval, maxval]?

I've gone back to trying to consider loops again.  What I'm not really understanding in the explanation of loop analysis provided by @chriseth is how we determine when a loop will or will not produce an overflow.  It might be easier to work through an example of what I consider to be a short but logically challenging loop:

```
uint8 x = 0;
uint8 y = 0;
while (x < some_array.length) {
  y += x;
  x++;
}
```

This loop will overflow `y` for `some_array.length` > 22, but in order for me (personally) to calculate that, I had to recognize that `y` represents the triangular number sequence and to then apply the formula for triangular numbers for the value 255 and arrive at the result, 22, as being the largest triangular number <= 255.  I'm sure there's a way to algorithmically analyze this, but I don't know where to get started to even find out.  It requires recognizing the rates of change of `x` and `y` inside the loop and then working out how many times the loop can execute before it will overflow.  Determining rates of change that are constant across loop iterations (e.g. `x++`) is not so hard because you can simply compare the values at the beginning and end of the loop.  But it's determining rates of change that will vary with each loop iteration (e.g. `y += x` when `x` also changes in the loop) that I can't figure out.

There's also the question of how to determine if the logic of the loop will ensure it runs only a certain number of times.  I'm not clear on how, in a general case, we would be able to take "this loop is safe for 23 iterations" and apply it back to the constraints in the `while( )` expression.

It's possible I don't understand the scope envisioned here or that I don't know of a good method for solving this issue because it's outside my usual area of expertise.  @chriseth, what do you think?

Can you please rebase and use the new experimental feature pragma?

@chriseth @leonardoalt @ekpyron @bit-shift @christianparpart do you think it would be worth the effort finishing this PR or all we in favour of dropping this for the SMT option we have? The main pain point with SMT solvers we have is their code size and as a result we cannot bundle it in the compiler. This PR was started around the same time as the SMT prototype work and after that showed signs of success, the idea here was mostly to have a crude overflow detection system.

I lean toward the SMT option, assuming we manage to finish the JS work.

Related to that we have the runtime overflow checks we've been talking about, still without conclusive experimental results.

I tend to be on the same opinion that runtime overflow checks should provide the safeguard (and thus be detected during testing), while SMT would give the tool to help identify those earlier in development.

Downside is that if a runtime test is missed, the contract may end up in an unrecoverable state, but that is just a result of inadequate testing and auditing.

Working towards making this PR reliable in all or at least most cases would probably mean reimplementing a custom SMT solver anyways, so I'd also lean towards dropping this in favor of the SMT option.
