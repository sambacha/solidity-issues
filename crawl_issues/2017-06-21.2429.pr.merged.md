Fixes #2430.

This will make it so votes can't be deleted accidentally by giving someone with weight > 1 the right to vote again

I tested modified code in Remix and voting/delegating still works and the bug is gone.

I'm opening an issue on this topic with a more thorough explanation.

@DillonBArevalo @axic Doesn't this create another bug?

1. Chairman gives a right to vote to person A.
2. Person A delegates to person B.
3. Chairman gives a right to vote to person B- doesn't work because person B has weight = 1 (even though person B never got the right to vote).

An alternative solution would be to remove this condition, and just have weight += 1 instead of weight = 1 ,though that would change the logic so that the chairman can give more weight to certain people, so maybe just adding another boolean flag instead.

@tzachshabtay I would be fine with `weight += 1` - the chairman has full power anyway, you can just add new accounts.
