This is work in progress and requires much more documentation. You could already check whether the contract is a valid payment channel, though.

I suggest not to merge this before #2553.

@chriseth updating this with the comments. Can you review? What is left to merge this?

@chriseth rebased. What is blocking this?

Some more comments are left to merge this. I actually would have liked to also include the frontend part. We can add a comment that this is still left to do.

@bit-shift @ekpyron do you want to write some actual Solidity code ^^? ðŸ˜‰

@chriseth asked me to adapt my code from https://programtheblockchain.com/posts/2018/05/11/state-channels-for-two-player-games/ to go in the documentation.

I wonder, though, if the code from https://programtheblockchain.com/posts/2018/02/23/writing-a-simple-payment-channel/ (or perhaps https://programtheblockchain.com/posts/2018/03/02/building-long-lived-payment-channels/) might be better? That's a one-way payment channel, which is simpler to get right (and thus simpler code).

I guess I'm asking what the goal is here. If it's to get across the fundamentals of state channels, then maybe my state channel post is the most appropriate starting point. If it's to introduce payment channels, then I think my "simple payment channel" post is a good starting point.

If the goal is just to show how signatures can be used to make off-chain commitments, then https://programtheblockchain.com/posts/2018/02/17/signing-and-verifying-messages-in-ethereum/ is perhaps an even better starting point.

I'm happy to adapt any of those to a short example for the documentation, but I'd love some guidance on what people want to see.

I think the goal is to show how easy it is to implement payment channels in etherem as opposed to bitcoin ;)

If a two-sided payment channel is too complicated, then a one-sided will do. It would be great if it could also include the required javascript code (or at least a snippet).

From a didactic point of view, it is probably a good idea to first have a short chapter on how to to create and verify signatures and then another chapter about how that can be used in payment channels.

Added an issue, perhaps someone is willing to put up a bounty for this: #4131

@smarx did you have time to work on this yet?

@chriseth No, sorry, I didn't. Looked like someone else is starting on the bounty, though!

There are much better examples now.

This was obsoleted by #4212.
