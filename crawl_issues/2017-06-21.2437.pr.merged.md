Can you add a test which actually corrupts the data?

I think this should do it?
```
contract A {
  uint8 a;
  uint248 b;

  function f() {
    (a, b) = (b, a);
  }
}
```

You mean and end-to-end test and check that data is corrupted (I actually would not call it corrupted, it is just that the order of assignments might be un-intuitive, or rather the programmer might expect the use of a temporary)? Your example would not do - value types are not affected by this behaviour.

Yes an end-to-end test expecting the corrupted value.
