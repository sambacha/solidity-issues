@benjaminion @zigguratt can you please double check this?

I can certainly do that but I'll be unavailable for the next couple of days. I'll take a look after that. Thanks for your continued LLL efforts, @axic! I'm still 100% committed to the advancement of the language. In fact, I'm working on LLL-related tasks full time now. I'm currently writing a series of articles about the structure of an LLL contract and how it relates to both Solidity and assembly.

Working nicely for me.
