The previous macro used the set built-in in a way incompatible with the current
implementation of set. This commit updates the macro to be more transparent in how it's
working and avoids the use of the set and alloc built-ins.

Test case included.

I don't fully know what `alloc` supposed to do, but very likely it is broken anyway :)

Looking into `alloc` more deeply is on my list, but it would be good to get all the current batch of fixes and tests merged before starting something else.

No promises, but I might also take up the challenge from @chriseth to write some documentation for the macros and other built-ins like `alloc`. It'll be a couple of weeks, though, best case.
