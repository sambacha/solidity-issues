Library addresses are currently hard-coded into compiled bytecode at link time. Enable lookup of library address via storage, which would allow e.g. hot swapping of logic.

I think this feature might have been requested already.

I tried to search past issues but couldn't find this specifically.

I am not sure this is a good idea from a security perspective. When changing the address there won't be a compiler around to verify that the ABI hasn't changed.

But is this much different from e.g. contracts that allow use of arbitrary ERC20 tokens? Users of the contract are aware that this is the case, and the contract may have specific logic to defend against poorly / maliciously formed tokens.

Similarly here, users of the contract would be aware that the library can be altered. Whether there are sufficient safeguards in place is up to the contract, e.g. only allowing switching to pre-defined addresses (which also have verifiable code).

A library currently suggests a much higher integration, especially as functions marked `internal` are inlined and bounded functions (with `using`) can be too.

Compared to that, an ERC20 token, if handled properly is always handled as an interface (preferable with an interface contract) and such is a loose integration.

I guess an easy syntactical way would be to allow an address at the place the library is used (if it is missing, it can still be supplied compile time):
```
function f() {
  L(0x1234).f();
}
```

however that would be repetitive so there must be a way to configure libraries.

How about 

```
using L at 0x1234;
function f() {
  L.f();
}
```

As a second step it could be extended to not only support hexadecimal literals, but variables:

```
uint libraryAddress;

function setLibrary(address _address) owner only {
  libraryAddress = _address;
}

using L at libraryAddress;

function f() {
  L.f();
}

```

`L(0x1234)` was criticized by some as a serious security risk.

To be honest, I would prefer no such mechanism.

`L(0x1234)` is only a risk if your contract allows it to be though - you can make the possible addresses explicit in the code, or only allow a TrustedAuthority to change them. Or is there more to it?

Developers are going to enable these mechanisms anyway via `delegatecall`. We can already do `MyContract(0x1234).callSomething()`.

I think hot swapping of logic is a very very good use case insofar as we're talking about reusable code and package management solutions. Currently linking is a fairly clunky process and the idea of code upgradeability is very difficult to create. Versioning is something that we should be looking to create a deeper integration of especially insofar as it concerns potential security threats from user error. 

Libraries should be able to go through multiple versions and contracts should be able to grow from and gain greater usage from these libraries down the line. It should definitely be contemplated carefully insofar as the syntax for this is concerned. (Something in the case of `using * for *`, an `at` at the end would be useful for addresses that could be changed over time).

I would very much appreciate this feature being added. I've been carefully deliberating between trying to find a way to accomplish this with library and interface syntax vs. just storing function selectors at the top of my contracts and using delegatecalls. Alas, it seems that the feature is not currently supported. After discovering this issue, I am sad, and will be going forward with what @rainbreak mentioned. Hope this changes in the future. @VoR0220 articulated my feelings exactly.

you can already very easily decouple storage from logic with 2 contracts and an interface.
i see no added benefit.

@OTTTO I would argue it's not easy at all but if you can point me to a project that has lived on the main chain and gone through numerous updates changing the interface and the underlying formatting of the storage of a contract, I would be much obliged.

@VoR0220, 
i will admit, i have yet to seen any reasonable way to change the data schema of the storage.

best way i've encountered so far is looping through all previously deployed storage addresses from the main contract in order of newest to oldest w/a getter function

There's no way in hell you believe that that is actually the most efficient way of doing this. My point being, we need to decide on an efficient and safe way and deeply integrate that language level for ease of management of contracts and long term sustainability of these development environments. My personal favorite solution for solving this at the EVM level is over here: 
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/905

With this we might be able to more fluidly and systemically add to the upgrading process to implement things like new features and lower cost operations from efficiencies in the compiler.

@OTTTO The typical solution to create an interface for a library is to create an abstract contract but that doesn't allow you to use the 'storage' keyword. And if you try to create an "abstract library" i.e. a library with only function signatures, truffle (at least, not sure about straight solcjs) throws a 
```
TypeError: Member "libraryFunction" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in library iLibrary
      iLibrary(libraryAddress).libraryFunction(data);
```

Clearly its not generating the function selector correctly. It's probably not paying attention to the storage keyword even when it is in the signature (abstract library version of iLibrary). Either way, I can't be bothered. I'll be sticking with the delegatecall solution to save myself the headache. Link me to a functional repo as a POC if/when you really figure out how to do this.

I believe the ability to call Libraries dynamically (similar to Contracts) would be a very useful feature of Solidity.

Currently my team is working on an upgradeable system where Libraries can be swapped out (upgraded), and we have resorted to using assembly blocks to do a delegate calls on these Libraries where the addresses aren't known at compile time, and do not remain constant as the system is upgraded.

It would be really great if we could simplify those blocks to something like `LibraryThing(libraryAddress).doSomething()`, similar to how Contract methods can be called `ContractThing(contractAddress).doSomething()`.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
