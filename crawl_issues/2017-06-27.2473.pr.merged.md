@chriseth `identifier` does not make sense because overloaded functions share the same identifier but have different hashes of function signatures.

The ABI specification calls this thing "Function Selector". Also `msg.sig` might sound like a cryptographic signature (especially in the context of a message).

Perhaps we should deprecate `msg.sig` and use the same word for both contexts.

`funSel`? `functionSelector`? `selector`?

`selector` was clear for me, even before reading @chriseth's comment. I'm in favor of deprecating `msg.sig` and using `selector` in both contexts.

We can then talk about the function signature as the plain-text representation that is hashed to obtain the function selector.

It is called as `methodIdentifier` and `externalIdentifier` in the compiler interface.

This works:

```
                      function h() external {
                      }
                      function f() external returns (uint) {
                              var g = this.h;
                              return g.sig;
                      }
```

This doesn't:
```
                      function h() external {
                      }
                      function f() external returns (uint) {
                              function () external g = this.h;
                              return g.sig;
                      }
```

(Calling `g()` in both cases works properly and the proper signature is put in the assembly.)

The code fails here:
```
string FunctionType::externalSignature() const
{
        solAssert(m_declaration != nullptr, "External signature of function needs declaration");
```

Probably `sig` on variables is not a good idea and `var` should be disabled, so have to check for `hasDeclaration()`.

Something is weird. On Linux it reports:
```
Running 1373 test cases...
Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
:5:12: Error: Return argument type uint32 is not implicitly convertible to expected type (type of first return variable) bytes4.

```

But on Windows there is only one failure:
```
C:/projects/solidity/test/libsolidity/SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp(157): fatal error: in "SolidityNameAndTypeResolution/function_types_sig": critical check !!sourceAndError.second has failed
```

What Linux reports is correct, but why is it missing on Windows?

@chriseth any idea why the Windows vs. Linux tests differ?

No, we have to investigate.

Difference is: the other compilation failure is part of the end-to-end tests, which is not run on Windows.

@chriseth the reason we wanted to disable them on variables is most of them don't have a name so the signature cannot be established.

Tha question remains: should we allow it for `var` when it refers to an actual functions and as such has the name?

@chriseth rebased (man, that was annoying) and I think this is as far as we can go without spending way too much time on it. It just checks if the declaration is available (e.g. has an external signature).

That means `var` assigning an actual external function works, but assigning anything via a function value type will not since that has no declaration (name).

Test bound functions. Perhaps for function types the stack also contains the first argument either before or after the function type.
