Hello!

Recently we've encountered an issue with some elements of our software stack which we've determined to be caused by the inclusion of on-chain metadata in contract binaries. We've noticed that this behavior was added in somewhere between v0.3.6 and v0.4.11, and found that there is no way to disable it.

This PR simply adds a command line flag, `--metadata-disable` as well as the corresponding setting in the JSON input (`settings.metadata.disableOnChainMetadata`) which skips calculation and appending of metadata to the compiled binaries.

Thank you for the pull request! Forcing the inclusion of the metadata hash was a conscious decision. Would you mind explaining the problem with your software stack?

Hi @chriseth!

So, we have a system for indexing contracts based on their code hash. A common pattern we use is that we have a `ModelManager` contract, with a `createModel` function that creates instances of `Model` contracts on the chain. We would then tell our software to index contracts whose code hash is that of `Model`'s. To derive the hash with our stack, we would compile the `ModelManager` and `Model` sources through two separate runs. Unfortunately, this means that the metadata generated for the two runs is different since the set of input files is different, and `ModelManager` would create `Model`s with different code hashes that were not specified for indexing, despite the original source code being identical between the two.

To clarify,
Assuming:
```
Sources(contract):  a function that returns the set of files that are input to the compiler
MD(contract, inputs):  a function that calculates the metadata for a given contract and a set of input files to the contract (inputs is necessary due to the "sources" field in the metadata)
FinalCode(contract, inputs): simply a concatenation of the contract bytecode and the CBOR encoding of {"bzzr0": swarmHash(MD(contract, inputs))}, much like what actually happens
```
We know in our example scenario that:
```
Sources(ModelManager) = [model.sol, modelmanager.sol]
FinalCode(ModelManager, Sources(ModelManager)) will produce bytecode for createModel that creates instances of Model whose code is x, where
x = FinalCode(Model, Sources(ModelManager))
```
that is, `ModelManager.createModel` will create instances of `Model` whose bytecode is `x`, and thus have a code hash of `keccak(x)`

Compiling the model alone to calculate it's codehash, leads to:
```
Sources(Model)  = [model.sol]
y = FinalCode(Model, Sources(Model))
```
`x` and `y` are different, even if the contents of `model.sol` are identical between the runs, because a different set of inputs was given to the compiler.
thus `keccak(x) =/= keccak(y)` despite the Model contracts having identical behavior, executable bytecode, and abi


Adding an option to skip the inclusion of the metadata outright was the most straightforward in terms of code and maintenance burden, and has the implication that someone who uses the flag understands what they're doing and sacrificing by choosing to drop the metadata hash from the bytecode.

OK, I think I understand your issue and I would like to fix it properly. If you run `solc model.sol modelmanager.sol`, you should get the code and codehash for both contracts, why can't you use that to compute the code hash?

Hopefully #2561 will solve this problem. @iostat can you please read the description and comment if it won't help your case?

Closing since this seems to be fixed properly.

@chriseth  May I be so bold as to suggest that the `--metadata-disable` flag is a good idea?

I am using `truffle test` to deploy a contract and to run a series of transactions by way of test. I have written a mutator that makes a small change to the contract and now I need a way to figure out whether my test kills a mutant.

One nice way of doing this is by comparing the amount of gas used per transaction for the original contract and the mutant. If the gas usage of the original and the mutant differ, the mutant is declared killed.

Now the trouble is that the amount of gas used by the contract deployment depends on the number of 0 bytes in the swarm hash generated from the meta data, and the meta data includes the keccak hash of the mutated source code. So I get about 20% false positives. I could fix this by aborting all tests with a swarm hash with 0 bytes, but this would be inefficient. 

So for me the `--metadata-disable` flag would be very nice to have for truffle deployments.
