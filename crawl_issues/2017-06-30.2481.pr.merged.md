# [\#2481 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2481) `merged`: MLOAD has side-effects, treat it like that in the optimiser

The side effect is memory extension. Code may rely on this fact (e.g. in the case of subsequent `MSIZE` or gas calculations).

Result of #2465.

You are right, although this simple change might have serious effects on the optimizer. Can you do some measurements on example contracts?

`SolidityOptimizer/cse_interleaved_memory_at_known_location_offset` fails and needs to be updated.

You mean size-wise?

Yes, size and gas-costs-wise.

Depending on the code, this can cause up to 10% increase in cost, but I think we have to merge it like that. If the optimizer only handles Solidity code, then there is no harm, but there might be some special circumstances where this does make a difference.
