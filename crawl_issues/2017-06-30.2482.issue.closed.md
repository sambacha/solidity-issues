# [\#2482 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2482) `closed`: Option to disable Unused local variable warning

There should be option to disable "unused local variable" warnings, since it's very annoying during development and makes errors harder to see. Many 3rd party contracts/libraries produce this warning, which makes it even worse. 

Thank you

You can "disable" the warning by e.g. commenting out the name of the variable:

`function f(uint /* x */) { }`.

Yeah, but wouldn't it be just simpler if we could do something like `--disable-unused-var-warning`

Disabling all unused variable warnings is too strong and there is a good way to disable the warning locally. Closing this.
