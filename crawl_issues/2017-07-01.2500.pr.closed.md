I rebased the branch, included the CR's from the original branch and cleaned up the code.

Replaces #2328.

Closes #2096.

There is one bit about which i am unhappy and would like your help:
When the code compilation leads to warnings, the method SourceReferenceFormatter::printExceptionInformation() wants to output the sourceLocation, which will always print the entire Json-file. This is not really helpful.
Also, as InlineAssemblyeCode needs its own scanner, I needed to add an extra variable m_currentSourceName to ASTJsonImporter which is only used once. 

I think the most appropriate way would be deal with the the generated warninsgs would be to output only the type of warning without the entire code. I am unsure about how to (elegantly) adjust the printExceptionInformation to that end.
i guess it's easiest to discuss this on a call...

Is this replacing #2328?

Also couldn't change the label to needsReview

@djudjuu pushed this changeset to the original branch to see which comments were left open (there are a couple), can you please check them there?

Hi @axic ,
I took another go at it, included all changes that were still missing, rebased it onto the current develop (in the process I had to squash my many commits into fewer and do a force push, although it meant that some of your comments are gone now, but otherwise i'd gone nuts. (They were some whitespace errors and some refactoring, no real design choices or the like....). 
I also included the comments from #2328.

Also, I put a question in the comment in CompilerStack.cpp l. 846....it's in the metadata creation function, which is also the place where I felt the most unsure about my choices.

Sorry for the delay. Thanks! Pushed your version to #2328 and can confirm all the questions were addressed.

I (finally) updated the missing pieces, yet I don't know what to do about the appveyor error. @chriseth can you help?

@djudjuu Are you planning on continuing with this? I'm just starting to look into it and I could help you in rebasing it (it has been dormant for quite a while now) and finishing it - or I could just take it over.

Hi @ekpyron ,

I have been meaning to continue working on this for ages. So yes, I am very interested to continue working on it, unfortunately my other work has been getting in the way.

If you'd be down to pair on it a little bit or just rebase it for a start, that'd be cool.

I am really keen on seeing it done  because I want to start
experimenting with a mutation-testing framework :)
So far my plan was to start working on it after december 5th, when I go
into vacation, but if you're down, we could start addressing it before that
too.

@djudjuu Ok, sounds great! I'll probably look into rebasing it sometime this week then and after that we can decide how to proceed.

Should be removed.

I looked into rebasing this a while ago, but the PR seems to be in a somewhat messy state (e.g. there's merge conflict markers in some of the commits that are only removed later, etc.) - so it may make sense to recreate it from scratch instead.

I tried rebasing it yesterday, but due to the merge commits it is rather hard. Tried rebasing it on an older head just to remove the merge and then squash, but haven't finished it yet.

It is probably easier to just create this from scratch.

Hi @ekpyron,

I restarted work on this again over here: https://github.com/djudjuu/solidity/pull/1

let me know if you want to help out!
