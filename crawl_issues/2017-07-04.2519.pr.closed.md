# [\#2519 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2519) `closed`: [WIP] Turn on safety features of Emscripten

Fixes #2506.

We have to compare the size increase (expect it to be reasonable small) and the speed decrease (this could be significant).

Size increase is significant (`11654262 Jul  4 17:48 build/solc/soljson.js`), that is about a 2 Mb increase.

The tests fail because the new version outputs a few messages to stderr from emscripten (such as "increasing memory", etc).

The settings used are from here http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/Debugging.html

Tests fail because solcjs CLI expects nothing on stderr:
```

# --bin
not ok 43 stderr was not empty ("NO_DYNAMIC_EXECUTION was set, using slow cwrap implementation ")
  ---

Do you still want to merge this or are the drawbacks too heavy?

Considering I've reduced the size from 10Mb to 6Mb with #2602 I think we can afford an increase now (it may also be smaller than before).

@axic is that still the case?

This depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/129.

Seems like the new `emcc` doesn't support one of the 3 settings:
```
WARNING:root:Assigning a non-existent settings attribute "STACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK"
WARNING:root: - perhaps a typo in emcc's  -s X=Y  notation?
WARNING:root: - (see src/settings.js for valid values)
```

Correction: the version on Travis doesn't support and ignores `STACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK`, but the one on Circleci uses it.

It can produce output like this (gnosis):

```
NO_DYNAMIC_EXECUTION was set, using slow cwrap implementation
enlarged memory arrays from 16777216 to 33554432, took 13 ms (has ArrayBuffer.transfer? false)
Warning: Enlarging memory arrays, this is not fast! 16777216,33554432
```

Or this (zeppelin):
```
enlarged memory arrays from 16777216 to 33554432, took 15 ms (has ArrayBuffer.transfer? false)
Warning: Enlarging memory arrays, this is not fast! 16777216,33554432
enlarged memory arrays from 33554432 to 67108864, took 62 ms (has ArrayBuffer.transfer? false)
Warning: Enlarging memory arrays, this is not fast! 33554432,67108864
```

Maybe there's no proper memory deallocation? Also wondering what causes that `NO_DYNAMIC_EXECUTION was set` message with these new flags.

Also currently the increase is only 1mb (compared to 2mb earlier):
Current Travis: `Emscripten output size: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7637505 Feb 20 21:47 soljson.js`
Current Circleci: `Emscripten output size: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8255543 Feb 20 22:07 soljson.js`

vs.

New Travis:`Emscripten output size: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 8728517 Feb 21 09:22 soljson.js`
New Circleci: `Emscripten output size: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9566740 Feb 21 09:08 soljson.js`

`NO_DYNAMIC_EXECUTION was set, using slow cwrap implementation`

was present in an old version with `ASSERTIONS` enabled, but the current (aka circleci's) version of emscripten doesn't have it anymore.

And the memory tracing is displayed due to `ASSERTIONS`: https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/incoming/src/preamble.js#L1025-L1033

Is this still of any use? Closing this PR and revisiting the issue at a later point in time should not be a problem, should it?

@ekpyron are you interested in taking this over? Need to evaluate which, if any, of these three options are worth the effort.

@axic As mentioned on gitter: I'm inclined to think they are not worth it. I can look into it some more though, but I'll be off until next month, so not before then.

The patching commit is not needed anymore, however it does add a significant size overhead:
```
Emscripten output size: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 11945664 Mar 14 15:09 soljson.js
Emscripten output size: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14649368 Mar 20 12:45 soljson.js
```

Tests seems  to pass with these fixes too. Due to the overhead, I think it would make sense to run this as part of the release process, but wouldn't need to enable it otherwise.

I updated the issue and added it for reconsideration of a dedicated test run before releases to the 0.5.12 project. I'm closing this PR, since we don't seem to plan to actually enable these (outside a potential dedicated test run) anymore.
