Don't merge it yet, this might use some refactoring.

@axic That's great! `with` is one of those keywords that was in Serpent's LLL but missing in Solidity's LLL. Excellent work.

Looks good to me. I tested with nested "with"s  and that works as well :-)

@zigguratt @benjaminion should we have this?

> @benjaminion should we have this?

If `with` behaved as described in #1288 (using the stack to hold the value) then I'd be a big fan. However, it looks to be implemented here as an in-memory variable. I don't really like variables for two main reasons:

 1. They interfere with memory management in ways that are hard to handle nicely.
 2. The memory space isn't reclaimed after a variable is undef'd (or goes out of scope in this case).

Having said that, others may find a use for this, so I wouldn't be against it, and there is a bigger picture to consider.

@benjaminion I agree it would be better keeping it on the stack - this is a quick and dirty version to have the feature for compatibility. Would be happy to have a stack version if you have time to work on it.

Is @benjaminion still working on this, or should we try to merge this version?

Hi @pirapira, @axic - not working on this currently. I did some initial analysis, but as far as I can see, persuading the LLL compiler to make better use of the stack would require a big re-organisation.  It would be great to do sometime - I've got use cases in mind around supporting proper functions in LLL, and integration with Solidity as an alternative to ASM - but it's beyond my powers at this time.

Happy for this to be merged.

Yep, it is a copy of the horrible style it has.
