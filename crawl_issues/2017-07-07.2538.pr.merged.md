Appveyor:

```
Performing configure step for 'z3-project'
  '.\configure' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.
C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\V140\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets(171,5): error MSB6006: "cmd.exe" exited with code 9009. [C:\projects\solidity\build\z3-project.vcxproj]
```

And emscripten tests ran out of memory - restarted to see if it is a permanent issue.

Concerning the configure error: I ran this against emscripten and it resulted in a 50mb .js file. It loaded quite fast but then also did not terminate while compiling.

I'm currently refactoring this to use the standardized LIBSMT2 interface between solc and the solver, this would also allow us to swap z3 by other solvers and provide it through remixd for browser-solidity.

Please rebase.

Discussion result: Link against z3 library if available. If not, report warning on the pragma. On emscripten / in jsonCompiler: provide callback for SMTLIB2.

Tests fail: some of the `SAT`/`UNSAT` cases were not updated.

@chriseth oops just merged the cmake changes and this needs to be updated.

@chriseth I shouldn't have merged this without rebasing after #2783. One of the scripts was removed which this depended on.

@chfast can you check if `cmake/FindZ3.cmake` can be done without that script?
