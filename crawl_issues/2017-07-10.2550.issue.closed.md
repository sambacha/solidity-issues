# [\#2550 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2550) `closed`: Stray warnings on structs - BREAKING CHANGE

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3859005?u=f4863d518451ebe42c16c776930e913335eb837b&v=4" width="50">[Tectract](https://github.com/Tectract) opened issue at [2017-07-10 13:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2550):

  struct notarizedImage {
    string imageURL;
    uint timeStamp;
  }

> Warning: Variable is declared as a storage pointer. Use an explicit \"storage\" keyword to silence this warning.\n string imageURL;

  struct storage notarizedImage {
    string imageURL;
    uint timeStamp;
  }

> ParserError: Expected identifier, got 'Storage'\n struct storage notarizedImage


I can no longer compile this contract without warning:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tectract/ethereum-demo-tools/master/GeektSolidity/contracts/Geekt.sol

This leads to the popular online tool "EthDeployer" not being able to compile and deploy MOST solidity smart contracts, even though they contain no errors.

http://www.enledger.io/EthDeployer/

This is a tool used by thousands of people to learn Solidity, since you guys removed the ability to COMPILE smart contracts from the node! Now it's broken.
