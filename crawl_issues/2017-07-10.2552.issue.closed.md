# [\#2552 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2552) `closed`: Parse the sources from documentation for the fuzzer tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-07-10 21:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2552):

Extend `scripts/isolate_tests.py` to do that.

Search for lines indented by 4 spaces and consider the lines following `pragma solidity` as source code until the indentation is less than 4 spaces.

If the comment `// This will not compile` is placed above the version pragma, ignore that source.
