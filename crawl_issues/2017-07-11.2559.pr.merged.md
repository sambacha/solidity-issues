@axic this is in respect of #2447 as promised.

I've produced a test suite for an ERC20 contract I wrote in LLL. If this is along the lines you are looking for then let me know and I will expand the tests a bit more. Equally, if you have something else in mind please give me some guidance. It runs as follows:

```
test/soltest -t LLLERC20/* -- --ipcpath /tmp/testeth/geth.ipc
```

If this approach is OK then I'll also do @zigguratt's ENS Registry as a separate test suite in due course.

I've added a bunch more tests and tidied up a bit.

Apart from the above two tiny things I think this is ready.

Actually, I've figured out how to access the event logging and have added some more tests around that, so I'm afraid there is a bit more to review... sorry!
