This should be possible by following all import statements of the source file of the contract recursively.

The relevant function is `CompilerStack::createOnChainMetadata`. The starting source unit can be obtained by following the `scope()` function of the contract until a `SourceUnit` is reached. Introducing helper functions to get the referenced source units from a source unit are probably a good idea.
