Especially when writing to state variables, it seems safer to be more explicit.

A "loose" way is to "enforce" some coding convention on state variables.  Another consideration is to make the use of `this` mandatory.  Other ideas welcome too.

Is this still an issue if #973 is implemented?

Yes, I think so.  Contract code is also for anyone reading it and trying to follow it.  (The more people that can read contracts and minimize the cognitive load, the higher the possibility that today's events will be more discoverable/preventable.)

The problem with requiring `this` for state variables is that `this` refers to the external interface, where state variables are changed to their getter functions. We could of course twist that since `this` has a special meaning and you could get the external interface using `ContractType(this)`. I don't think anyone is actively using `this.a` for anything else than passing callbacks.

If `this.a` is a good way to achieve the goal of explicitness when accessing state variables, then yes I do think that requiring `ContractType(this)` to access the external interface is a beneficial "tradeoff".

The alternative here is an explicit assignment operator: <- or :=

We could issue a warning and then slowly deprecate = assignments to state variables if this moves forward.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
