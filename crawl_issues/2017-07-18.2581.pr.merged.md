Fixes #2578. Messages still have room to improve but are much more helpful now.

@axic what do you think of this new approach?

I left the fullyQualifiedName for functions because it wasn't hurting and may come in handy later.

I wonder if it would make sense emitting all errors or just one-by-one as we do now?

Can you also add a changelog entry?

@chriseth please review this, would be nice to include in the next release

This looks good. Sorry I wasn't able to update the PR by Sunday, I got food poisoning and I am still recovering.
