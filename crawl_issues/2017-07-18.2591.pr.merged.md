# [\#2591 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2591) `merged`: LLL: disable optimiser entirely if requested

This disables the more simple optimisations (peephole, deduplicate, etc) if optimisation is turned off.

Those are really relevant for Solidity, not so much for LLL - though they can make a difference there too.

@benjaminion @zigguratt what do you think?

Yep, good with me. One reason we like LLL is that it doesn't do unexpected things behind our backs. As long as we can always explicitly re-enable the optimiser with `-o`, it's better, I think.
