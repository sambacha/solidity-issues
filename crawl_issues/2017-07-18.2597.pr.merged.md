Fixes #2468.

With modifiers being public I guess reading from another contract could work `C.mod()`, but that is rejected by the parser anyway.

@axic Could you expand on what you meant by "modifiers being public"? Isn't it exactly the purpose of this PR to leave that off the table?

I do think that modifiers should always be internal, but I wanted to clarify that if #2467 is fixed, `C.mod()` _will_ be valid syntax.

It was only a remark that before this change, when modifiers were public, maybe one could have invoked them as `C.mod()`, but the parser rejects the `.` so it was not possible anyway.

It continues not to be possible after the change.

I understand now, thanks!
