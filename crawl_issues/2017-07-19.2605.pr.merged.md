I believe that, in conversation with @chriseth back in June, we'd agreed to not pursue a complete call graph from the constructor to hunt down all indirect uses of `this`.  If that's still the case, then I think the work here is done-- it's rebased, reporting warnings through `ErrorReporter`, and has a test case.

Fixes #583
