Use it to check for different conditions:
- [ ] using `this.` in indirectly in the constructor
- [x] using state write methods (indirectly) in functions marked `view`
- [x] using state read methods (indirectly) in functions marked `pure`

The first item is not yet implemented, but would be useful.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
