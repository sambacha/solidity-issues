@axic, would you kindly please review and comment on these suggested changes?  I think the idea is sound, but my C++ totally sucks, so I'd appreciate your guidance.

The point is that when LLL IF expressions are nested in the "else" branches, the compiler currently produces chains of pointless jumps. Consider this code:

```
(seq
  (def 'input (calldataload 0x04))
  ;; Calculates width in bytes of utf-8 characters.
  (return
    (if (< input 0x80) 1
      (if (< input 0xE0) 2
        (if (< input 0xF0) 3
          (if (< input 0xF8) 4
            (if (< input 0xFC) 5
              6)))))))
```

Before these changes:

```
  jumpi(tag_12, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0x80))
  jumpi(tag_19, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xe0))
  jumpi(tag_26, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xf0))
  jumpi(tag_33, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xf8))
  jumpi(tag_40, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xfc))
  0x6
  jump(tag_42)  ;; Note how it jumps 42 -> 44 -> 46 -> 48 -> 50.
tag_40:
  0x5
tag_42:
  jump(tag_44)
tag_33:
  0x4
tag_44:
  jump(tag_46)
tag_26:
  0x3
tag_46:
  jump(tag_48)
tag_19:
  0x2
tag_48:
  jump(tag_50)
tag_12:
  0x1
tag_50:
  0x0
  mstore
  return(0x0, 0x20)
```

After these changes:

```
  jumpi(tag_12, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0x80))
  jumpi(tag_19, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xe0))
  jumpi(tag_26, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xf0))
  jumpi(tag_33, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xf8))
  jumpi(tag_40, lt(calldataload(0x4), 0xfc))
  0x6
  jump(tag_42)  ;; Now it jumps straight to the end.
tag_40:
  0x5
  jump(tag_42)
tag_33:
  0x4
  jump(tag_42)
tag_26:
  0x3
  jump(tag_42)
tag_19:
  0x2
  jump(tag_42)
tag_12:
  0x1
tag_42:
  0x0
  mstore
  return(0x0, 0x20)
```

This leads to a nice reduction in execution gas and smaller, simpler assembly code.  The optimiser doesn't seem able to spot this behaviour, and in any case it's better to eliminate the inefficiency at source. For non-nested IF expressions it has no effect. It also has no effect if the nesting is in the "then" branch (there are some smaller improvements to be made here - redundant jumpdests - but I want to check this out with you first).

How about `(switch)` which has 1, 2*N or 2*N+1 arguments:
- the last argument (odd) is the default value
- for every 2 pairs the first is the condition and the second is the value

```
(switch
  1) ;; default case with value 1
(switch
  (= n 2) 4) ;; one case only
(switch
  (= n 2) 4 ;; first case
  (= n 4) 8) ;; second case
(switch
  (= n 2) 4
  (= n 4) 8
  1)
```

Well, I've given this some deep thought and the attached remains the best I have. Perhaps it demonstrates that there is a use case for `pop_back()`.

In any case, I'd be happy to have a go at writing a `switch` expression along the lines you suggest. It would be a good test of my understanding, whether or not we decide it's useful. Just a couple of clarifications:

 * All the even-numbered arguments (the "values") should be required to result in the same deposit, either 1 or 0, and the expression overall will evaluate to a value or null (no deposit) respectively.
 * I think the case of 2N arguments makes sense only if all the "values" are required to have deposit 0, otherwise what does the expression evaluate to if none of the cases match? So, of your examples, 1 and 4 would be OK, but 2 and 3 would not be allowed. Alternatively, if the "values" have deposit 1 we could implicitly add a `0` at the end as the default value. Then all your examples would make sense.

I'll give it a go.

@benjaminion can we close this in favour of #2622?

Closing this as we try to avoid assembly item manipulation and the `switch` statement seems to be more useful alltogether.
