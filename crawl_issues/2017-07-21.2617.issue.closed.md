# [\#2617 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2617) `closed`: doc says functions are by default `internal` - parity exploit

I was just [made aware](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/commit/e06a1e8dd9cfd8bf5d87d24b11aee0e8f6ff9aeb#commitcomment-23221966) that [the docs](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#function-types) currently say:

>By default, function types are internal, so the internal keyword can be omitted.

To the best of my knowledge that is not true, otherwise the Parity multisig exploit would not have happened. This is important to get right. Or do you plan to change that and updated the docs already ahead of time?

Thanks, just raised that here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2608#issuecomment-316956089

But might be worth a separate ticket.

The documentation should be clearer, but function types refer to function type variables:

```
function f() {
  // This creates a function type (and it defaults to internal visibility):
  function (uint, uint) x;

  // It is possible to retrieve the type of a function (the function above defaults to public visibility):
  var y = f;

  // Assign the function f() to a local function type:
  function () external z = this.f;
}
```

The [part of the documentation referring to functions](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters) says:
> Functions can be specified as being `external`, `public`, `internal` or `private`, where the default is `public`.

Agree, this should be a lot clearer. Many people read the doc not like a book and pick up all definitions that you gave earlier. Lets make it clear again in the section on function types. I would call that entire section "Function parameter types" to avoid any confusion in the first place. But at least rephrase:
> By default, function types are internal, so the internal keyword can be omitted

To something like

> By default, function variable types are internal, so the internal keyword can be omitted. Note that function visibility is not `external`/`public`/`internal`/`private` and you need to set these yourself if needed.
