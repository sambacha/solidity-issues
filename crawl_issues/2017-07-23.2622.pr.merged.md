### Introduction

This is an implementation of a `switch` expression in LLL.  The background is in #2611: in short,

  1. the compiler does not generate particularly efficient code for nested `if` expressions, and

  2. deeply nested `if`s are visually difficult to decode.

### Description

The basic pattern is

    (switch
      COND1 EXPR1
      COND2 EXPR2
      ...
      CONDn EXPRn
      EXPR0)

Each `CONDx` is evaluated in turn:

  * If `CONDx` evaluates to non-zero then the immediately following expression, `EXPRx`, is evaluated and evaluation stops.  `EXPRx` provides the overall value of the `switch` expression.
  
  * If `CONDx` evaluates to zero then evaluaton moves to the next `COND` and `EXPRx` is ignored.

The final `EXPR0` is optional and provides a default or fallback value.  If all of the `COND`s evaluate to zero then,

  * If `EXPR0` is present the `switch` expression evaluates to `EXPR0`.

  * If `EXPR0` is not present the `switch` expression evaluates to `void` (nothing on the stack; no action performed).

All of the `EXPR`s must leave the same number of values on the stack, either zero or one. As a consequence, if the default `EXPR0` is not present, then all of the `EXPR` must leave zero items on the stack.

A `switch` with only one argument (i.e. no `COND` expressions) evaluates to that argument: `(switch EXPR)` is identical to `EXPR`.

### Examples

    (switch 1)        => 1

    (switch 1 [0]:42) => (mstore 0 42)

    (switch 0 [0]:42) => <void>

    (switch
      0 1
      1 2)            => does not compile ("InvalidDeposit")

    (switch
      0 [0]:0
      1 [32]:1)       => (mstore 32 1)

    (switch
      0 1
      2 3
      4)              => 3

    (switch
      0 [0]:0
      0 [32]:1
      [64]:2)         => (mstore 64 2)

### Naming

On naming, this structure resembles Lisp's `cond` statement, but is not exactly the same, thus we are proposing to use a different name, `switch`.  Lisp also has a `case` statement that is quite different, so best to avoid that name as well.

### Performance

With a single conditional, the gas usage of `switch` is the same as that of the equivalent `if` expression.  With more conditionals, the performance of `switch` is increasingly better than the equivalent nested `if`s.  Asymptotically, the nested `if` structure adds an overhead of 12 gas per branch evaluated when compared with the equivalent `switch` expression.

Extending each structure with extra conditionals adds one less byte of EVM code per conditional when using `switch` than when using `if`.

I'm not wedded to the behaviour of this regarding deposits, and am happy to consider alternatives. Having said that, the discipline imposed by the scheme outlined seems to be worthwhile.

The hardest thing conceptually was the whole deposit handling code internally - the detail level of the proposed tests reflects this. We probably don't need them all.  It might benefit from some negative tests in _Parser.cpp_ to check cases when it should throw an Invalid Deposit error.

Added compiler tests to verify the failure cases.
