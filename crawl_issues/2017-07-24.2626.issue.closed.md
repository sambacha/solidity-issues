This depends on https://github.com/ethereum/interfaces/issues/4 (i.e. agreeing on a test RPC class and implementing it in Geth).

Added here as a long term goal.

Is this about always running geth and cpp-ethereum as part of the CI? If yes, then I don't see the benefit. Whether or not the two clients produce the same result is not something that should be tested with the solidity CI, but with the cpp-ethereum / go-ethereum CI. We can provide scripts to run on demand, though.

Making soltest compatible with both cpp-ethereum and geth, on the other hand, is something we should do.

First, the RPC API must be defined and other clients need to support it. It would be useful for developers coming from other clients.

Second, I think running it with both Geth and Cpp is useful in CI, because despite best efforts in test case creation (ethereum-tests), even if a single test failure can be produced in Solidity in the future, it was worth the extra 2-3 minutes spent on CI.

They merged "retesteth" support in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/19631, so it might be worth looking into this again, since they now seem to implement most, if not all, of the RPC API we need for soltest.
EDIT: Adding this to the 0.5.10 project to stage it for reconsideration.

De-prioritizing because we probably want to switch to EVM-C first and then this should be easy to do.

This is now obsolete since we use EVMC + evmone.
