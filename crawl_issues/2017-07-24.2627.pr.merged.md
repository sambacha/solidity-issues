# [\#2627 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2627) `merged`: Change Mapping example to valid (executable) code

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7475584?v=4" width="50">[atfornes](https://github.com/atfornes) opened issue at [2017-07-24 16:31](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2627):

Current example will not compile and would need to be compiled in separate files, unlike how it is shown (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2618).

The proposed changes provide both a source code that compiles and a easier to understand Contract creation (using new instead of a contract address).

Wonderful, thanks!
