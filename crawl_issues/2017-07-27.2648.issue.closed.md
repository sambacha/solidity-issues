Will it be/is it currently possible to write custom getters for public variables that are user-defined structs, possible with something like a getter modifier? E.g.:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.13;

contract Example {
    struct myStruct {
        uint myInt;
        bool myBool;
        bytes32[] myArr;
    }

    myStruct public expose;

    function expose() getter returns (bool) {
        return expose.myBool;
    }
}
```

This is not possible without modifying the name, although I think the following  should be allowed:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.13;

contract Example {
    struct myStruct {
        uint myInt;
        bool myBool;
        bytes32[] myArr;
    }

    myStruct expose;

    function expose() external returns (bool) {
        return expose.myBool;
    }
}
```

What do you think, @axic?

It can only work if `expose()` is marked `external`, while if `internal`/`public` it would be a declaration clash. Technically it is fine.

Considering the reliance on visibility, it may not be a good idea to allow it to avoid confusion (and potential future issues).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
