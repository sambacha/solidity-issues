# [\#2657 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2657) `merged`: Introduce JumpdestRemover optimisation step

Some of the bigger assemblies in the Parity multisig (assembly items: before, after):
```
5474 -> 5430
3857 -> 3802
3638 -> 3635
3616 -> 3616
```

The function dispatcher leaves a lot of stray jumpdests, we could fix that or could keep a simple remover such as this.

Haven't bothered updating the tests which check the exact bytecode before the code is accepted.

Probably this should be run again after dedup/CSE.

This step was previously done by the control flow graph optimizer, but it was removed because we currently cannot assume that labels that are never pushed can be removed, because they can be stored in storage. If we do a full analysis also passing in referenced labels "from above", it might work. In any case, there should be a test that fails if you do not consider this.

Hm, yes that's true, this change would break that.

Thinking a bit more about that, is that valid usage though? If it is at any point of time pushed to storage in the code/constructor, it is already safe.

In an example like ```{ 4 calldataload jump } ```, where the tag is received from the calldata it wouldn't work. The question is: is that a valid use case we want to support? I don't think so.

When the jumpdest remover as currently implemented analyses the runtime assembly, it does not consider the jumpdests from the runtime assembly that were accessed in the creation time assembly.

True. Is that an actual case we have? I guess if helpers are used in a constructor which are also used  in runtime functions. Strange no tests caught this, should add a test for it.

The test `store_internal_unused_function_in_constructor` should fail.

Doesn't seem to fail on that one.

As can be seen here - https://medium.com/@hayeah/diving-into-the-ethereum-vm-part-2-storage-layout-bc5349cb11b7 - it seems we have a lot of jumpdests that hinder peephole or CSE optimization, so increasing the priority of this.

Ok, now I'm relieved: The test does actually fail.

Can you add some specific tests (including subassemblies) to `test/libevmasm/Optimiser`?

Added test.

Weird that the compiler does not warn about that...

@chriseth as discussed last meeting we wanted to run the truffle tests on openzeppelin with this change.
