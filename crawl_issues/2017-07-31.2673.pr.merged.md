Fixes #2671. Depends on #2674.

I realised after looking at the `gas_for_builtin` test that this was intentional. Not sure this is documented and thus code in the wild wouldn't use it, which would be the point to keep old code running after a hard fork (where gas cost may change for these builtins).

I think the best solution would be forwarding the maximum gas possible to `ecrecover`/`sha256`/`ripemd160` and disallowing overriding them.

@chriseth please review this, would be nice to include in the next release
