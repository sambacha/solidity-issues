After Metropolis.

Is there a plan to deprecate the opcode?

The blockhash contract is much more expensive, I don't think we should switch to using it.

 For the first 256 items it shouldn't be any different - though it is not decided yet whether it is subsidised or not, given the contract is not ready. In any case the cost will increase.

Alternatively it could call the opcode for <=256 and the contract otherwise, if there will be a significant difference.

Closing since [EIP-210](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-210) was dropped in Byzantium and hasn't been picked up since.
