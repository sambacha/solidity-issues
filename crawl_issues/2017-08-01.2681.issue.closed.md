# [\#2681 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2681) `closed`: Proposal: use and recommend .solidity file extension (for syntax highlighting on github)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3036030?v=4" width="50">[veox](https://github.com/veox) opened issue at [2017-08-01 12:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2681):

EDIT: The `.gitattributes` approach mentioned below now works with `linguist`. Add to `.gitattributes`:

```
*.sol linguist-language=Solidity
*.or-any-other-extension-you-like linguist-language=Solidity
```

Original issue description follows.

-----

The main reason there's still no Solidity syntax highlighting on github is that the `.sol` extension is too generic.

(There have been several attempts made so far, which I've listed in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3560. That PR itself is likely to get scrapped.)

Therefore, `linguist` can't classify `.sol` files as "Solidity" based on extension alone. It must run a heuristic to determine a language based on the file's contents.

However, due to `linguist`'s current design, heuristics have no way of indicating "no match" (documented in issue https://github.com/github/linguist/issues/3589). That, coupled with the same fact that `.sol` is too generic, will mean that a lot of unrelated files will still be mis-classified, which in turn means the heuristic approach is a no-go.

So, there are two options I see now:

### `.gitattributes` file

Don't rely on github's automated classification, and ask everyone to manually hint the language via `.gitattributes` (as in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3559).

Both new and old projects will have to do this if they want highlighing.

This will likely be made available regardless (probably by @frangio, ~~as discussed in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3559~~ in PR https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3755).

### `.solidity` extension

Use a file extension that unambiguosly describes the contents.

Old projects would have to mass-rename files, as well as mass-replace `import` statements, which will change their Swarm hashes AFAIU.

~~AFAIU gists would have manual selection for "Solidity" as soon as _some_ form of an actual classifier is merged into `linguist`.~~

Gists no longer have a "Language" drop-down selection. They likely now completely rely on the file extension.

Any chance of fixing `linguist` to indicate "no match"?

Not sure. It seems to be low on their priority list, and in either case might require changing the approach to classification in `linguist`. Since it's used and maintained by github, with a humongous set of files that _might_ get erroniously re-classified... the process is necessarily slow.

Essentially, what I'm proposing is for Solidity to step out of the "edge case territory" that is the `.sol` extension.

-----

@Alhadis also (jokingly?..) [proposed](https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3560#issuecomment-319352022) `.sold` in one of the above PRs, which has seen very minimal use on github so far.

This might be a compromise if a short extension is still desired, although it has the same downsides as `.solidity`.

EDIT: Since the purpose of an extension seems to be aiding machine classification, I'd still recommend `.solidity`, since, well, that describes a Solidity file best.

Half-jokingly. My best ideas tend to come out while talking shit. Seriously.

[`.solid`](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Asolid+NOT+nothack&type=Code) also looks ripe for the taking, albeit with more in-the-wild results (717 so far, which is still trivial).

Would like to note that some people are already using [`.solidity`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=extension%3Asolidity+NOT+nothack&type=Code) (24 results ATM). Not sure why.

If we are considering alternatives, `.sldt` sounds good too and has [minimal usage in GitHub](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=extension%3Asldt+NOT+nothack&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

In my opinion I'd only consider `.solidity` (preferred if there must be a new name) or `.solid`, but I think this is way more down to the users and not to the compiler as it is agnostic to filenames.

Then make it a pushy, angry atheist to filenames, because indecisiveness or indifference towards standardised file-extensions is the sort of thing that leads to our original problem of thousands of moderately-used `.sol` extensions, and [me screaming in fatigue-encrypted Latin](https://github.com/Alhadis/Linguist-Silo/commit/be6c83d8033ea1eaaf7fdd4be18f6094f91fe84e) wondering where the hell to begin organising files based on non-existent formats. :(

TL:DR; Rename language `.sparta` and nobody's gonna fuck with you.

I think what I'm trying to say is this: it would *help* to decide on a definitive extension, and having a technical rationale behind that adds incentive for the community to follow. Otherwise, if it's just a community *recommendation*, well... there're dicks like me who openly go out of their way to push stuff like that. :D

I am sure this has been raised several times, but is looking for `pragma solidity [^;]+;` not good enough to find a Solidity file? 😉

It would be, if only Linguist's classifier worked that way... to `TL;DR` it for you: having that course of logic would require every other `.sol` file that *doesn't* match that pattern to fall under a particular language type. So there's currently no real option for a `not-a-language` or `inconclusive` result. :(

This is aside the discussion whether `.sol` is a good name or not:

I am still puzzled a bit why we are trying to change the extension of a language to workaround a bug in a piece of software used by a commercial entity. Is it nigh impossible to implement the `not-a-language` feature in `linguist`?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2346707?u=bd0eb4f21fd0eb6fb74043f803b1edb6c54f488a&v=4" width="50">[Alhadis](https://github.com/Alhadis) commented at [2017-08-02 10:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2681#issuecomment-319639333):

It's a technical issue that happens to be beyond our current ability to fix: it involves digging around and under the base tier of logic that happens when Linguist's classifier runs - the last stage is the Bayesian classifier, which returns a list of sample/language pairs rated with varying levels of confidence. @pchaigno assures me there's no way of working outside that thread of logic, but I'm not so sure...

Let's be realistic though: the morass of varied search results would imply many other users have the `.sol` extension used for their own purposes... wouldn't you rather Solidity be represented by a distinctive, easy-to-recognise extension? ;)

Craziest proposal so far: Solidity compiles filename extension `solidarity`...since my friends always misnames the language to that anyway...might be worthwhile to atleast add legitimacy to their mistake. 🥉

Are there any reasons why both `.sol` and `.solidity` can't be accepted? People could choose the `.solidity` extension moving forward if they want the benefits of automatic github syntax highlighting _and_ completely unambiguous file extensions, and anyone else could just create a `.gitattribute` file (if they even want syntax highlighting) without the need to refactor their codebase.

Choose both, just make sure you give the `.sol` extension the 🖕. 😀

I voted for `.sold` because it has a chime to it and a subtle wit makes it memorable.

IMO ATM there's no actionable for the repo maintainers here.

The Solidity developer community historically uses `.sol`; there are costs to switching (in time and broken pipelines at least), and no immediate benefits.

Voting won't help with removing the costs, but it does indicate already that quite a few are reluctant to do it in either case.

The `.gitattributes` approach is therefore more likely. The relevant `linguist` PR is https://github.com/github/linguist/pull/3755.

@veox if that PR is merged, what is the appropriate line to be placed into `.gitattributes`?

It would be nice to include that in the Solidity documentation once it is merged.

According to [their `README`](https://github.com/github/linguist#overrides):

```
*.sol linguist-language=Solidity

The PR in question doesn't pass CI currently, so is distant from being merged.

@axic @federicobond @VoR0220, one of you can confirm that the `.solidity` extension is good for now in the linguist package?

We could use the `*.sol linguist-language=Solidity` line in the `.gitattributes` file to override it (I will make a pull request on solidity when the linguist PR will be merged) and having the highlighting syntax which will be awesome!

The PR by @oktapodia has just been merged.

Solidity syntax highlighting should become available on github (with the above-mentioned `.gitattributes` approach, for files of any extension) with the next `linguist` release or so.

If anyone still sees value in Solidity files being recognised automatically, this issue should IMO stay open. Otherwise OK to close.

@veox thanks for confirming.  So...I have a .sol gist that is not highlighting, should it be?  Or would a further change be required somewhere?

Alternatively, is there a way to embed syntax-highlighted files from a repo as if they were a gist?  :)

@codingthat, @NachoPal according to the pull request, the language was added under the .solidity extension. Changing your gist to that extension should give you highlighting. In a repo, you can keep using the .sol extension and add the extension to your .gitattributes.

edit: Actually that's not working for me. no idea.

edit2: Apparently they removed the extension right before merging. Only gitattributes will work I guess

@codingthat I think it only works for `.sol` extension.

But `.solidity` was just a workaround for `.sol` being too ambiguous to be properly supported, right? Now github's detection can deal with it. This issue was opened in 2017 so the question is: how widespread is `.solidity` in practice. Should we keep pushing for wider support for it or is it obsolete now?

This issue is certainly obsolete. Changing the extension now is probably not possible since the community has adopted `.sol` a long time ago.

☝️ This. Also, to clarify a point of confusion — language stats are cached on GitHub, so repositories that haven't been updated recently will still show stats computed when the last change was pushed. Making a small edit to a file is enough to purge the cache of stale data and recompute usage statistics.
