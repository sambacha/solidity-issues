I will find a test case that fails on my comment and then fix it.

I'm changing the condition to "warn about shadowing if the parent scope (or one of its parent scopes) contains an identifier of the same name". I think this should catch all cases and does not introduce any false positives. I will check if this is true for the global scope.

Do we need to add more tests to this then?

Yes, I think we should.
