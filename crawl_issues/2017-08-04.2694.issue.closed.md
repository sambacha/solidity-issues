`mulmod(a, b, 0)` is zero, which isn't consistent with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/670
Was it missed?

(tested on http://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.4.14+commit.c2215d46.js)

I think it was just missed. 

Even the documentation says "Division by zero and modulus with zero throws an exception.", though not for the global functions part (where mulmod / addmod) resides.

I think fixing this would be a breaking change, since it was missed last time and compiling the same will result in different behaviour.
