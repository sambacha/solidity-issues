Fixes #1769.

This also catches:
```
library L {
  function f() internal;
  fucntion g() { f(); }
}
```

but that is fine since libraries can inherit other libraries so no way to implement it.

Will disable unimplemented internal library functions in `FunctionDefinition`, but also need to come up with a more comprehensive list of tests for that.
