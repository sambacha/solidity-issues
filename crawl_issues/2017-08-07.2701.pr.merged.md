# [\#2701 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2701) `merged`: Add isDynamicallyEncoded member function to types.

This was extracted from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2433

Previously, `isDynamicallySized` was used, but that function does not work properly for example for the type `uint[][2]` (which is not a problem because we do not support multi-dimensional arrays yet).
