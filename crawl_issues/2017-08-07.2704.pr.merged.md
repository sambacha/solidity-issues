This is disabled for now (waiting for "experimental pragma").

Depends on: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2701 , https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2700 , https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2690

What experimental pragma to use?

`abiEncoderV2` ?

Can you please rebase?

This allows multi-dimensional arrays in interfaces unconditionally, i.e. now only if the experimental mode is turned on. This is more or less required because it is a type feature.

I don't think this is harmful, because it will only cause an "unimplemented feature" exception in the code generator. I don't think it changes any interfaces, but I'm not 100% positive on that.

Ok, hopefully no failures anymore now.

Fails on:
```
/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ArrayUtils.cpp(290): fatal error in "void dev::solidity::ArrayUtils::copyArrayToMemory(const dev::solidity::ArrayType &, bool) const": std::exception: Nested dynamic arrays not implemented here.
/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/test/RPCSession.cpp(324): last checkpoint
```

I haven't reviewed the actual encoder yet, but the rest (bar the above) seems ok.
