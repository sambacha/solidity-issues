# [\#2707 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2707) `closed`: raise an error when a statement can never have side-effects
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

When a statement contains
* no calls on accounts
* no assignments
* no function calls
* no event logging
* no variable declaration, and
* no `new` expression
the statement does not do anything and can be removed, so the compiler should raise an error.

This prevents things like
* `1;`
* `variable == 3;`

A good start to this feature could be detecting empty function and event calls, which aren't even assigned to a variable. That should be possible to implement manually. It would raise a warning on:
- `myFunction;`
- `MyEvent;`
- `address(1).call.value(1234);`

@ekpyron I think you have worked on unreachable code and code without effect detection. Can you update this issue where we stand and what is left to be supported?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
