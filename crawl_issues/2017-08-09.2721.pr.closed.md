# [\#2721 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2721) `closed`: [WIP] Callgraph builder

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-08-09 13:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2721):

Fixes #2606. Part of #992.

This is a class that builds a call graph that contains semantic information about each AST node. This can be used for view/pure-analysis and much more.

For the sake of testing please call the builder during compilation (even if not used) to see if it crashes on any tests.

Reconsidering:
- would be nice to add tests for core features in the style of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp#L615
- separately add warnings (or errors - depending whether we consider it breaking) to ``view`` functions

Rebased.

Test is failing due to statemutability changes:
```
/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/libsolidity/analysis/CallgraphBuilder.cpp:401:39: error: no member named 'isConstant' in 'dev::solidity::FunctionType'
   affectStateArbitrarily = !function.isConstant();
                             ~~~~~~~~ ^
```

I think this is not yet the right data to be collected. I will work a little on the high-level features that will make use of the callgraph analyzer to see what we actually need.

This turned out to be not very useful.
