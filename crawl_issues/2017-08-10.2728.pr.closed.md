# [\#2728 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2728) `closed`: [WIP] Uniform type identifiers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-08-10 18:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2728):

Depends on #2724.

The issue was that some of them had an underscore between elements, while others didn't.  I guess it is deliberately omitted before identifier lists because those start with a $ sign.

This PR isn't consistent yet.

@chriseth can you explain the logic here? Before this change in some cases there are underscores before identifiers in others there aren't any.

@chriseth is there a documentation about the format of this?

No, there is no documentation. We should probably also postpone the escaping: Introduce a function `richIdentifier` which can use things like `(` and ` ` and is used to compose the identifier and then replace them in the `identifier()` function.

Btw, are these identifiers still in use?

Yes, they are essential in the new ABI coder.

The property we have to support here is: type identifiers are equal if and only if types are equal.

This would be nice. I remember some PRs from a year ago where you and @pirapira discussed the escaping rules. Do you still remember those?

I agree, we should introduce rich identifiers and escape them.

I think the rules should actually be documented in the code, but I think the following replacements are done:

```
$ -> $$
( -> $_
) -> _$
, -> _$_
```

Here is the old PR: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1576

It claims to translate `$` to `$$$`

Found it: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.h#L163-LL169

```
	/// The identifier should start with "t_".
	/// More complex identifier strings use "parentheses", where $_ is interpreted as as
	/// "opening parenthesis", _$ as "closing parenthesis", _$_ as "comma" and any $ that
	/// appears as part of a user-supplied identifier is escaped as _$$$_.
```

This depends on a better escaping mechanism.

Closing because it is not finished and can be easily re-done.
