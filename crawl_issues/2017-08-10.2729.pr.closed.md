# [\#2729 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2729) `closed`: Disallow empty source name in standard json

The reason for this change was that `outputSelection` would be confused, because empty source name refers to SourceUnit-level outputs (aka AST).

However, `jsonCompiler` needs to be amended, because the old `compile()` entry point has only a source code and uses an empty file name. The same applies to `compileJSON()` it allows empty file names. (Need to add test for this in solc-js just to be sure too.)

What is the state of this PR?

`jsonCompiler` needs to be reviewed how it fits in for the legacy use cases as there it might require right now the use of an empty file name.

I also have another change set which cleans this up in `CompilerStack`.

Revisited this again and empty source name is not an issue, empty contract name is.
