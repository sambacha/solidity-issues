I tried to compile Solidity in Ubuntu 16.04.2. I have installed the dependencies.

This seems to be a gcc compiler bug:

Usually this is due to out-of-memory on the compiling machine. Are you running this inside a virtual machine?

I think we can close this issue. This is due to running on a VM where disk space was running low and memory was also running at 100%. I cleaned it up and now got it built. Thank you @chriseth

As mentioned earlier compiling solidity was more an issue with VM I was using. This is working fine now.
