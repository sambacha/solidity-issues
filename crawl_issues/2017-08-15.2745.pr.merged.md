Need to add tests for pure functions and function types.

I think there are some places where `== StateMutability::View` has to be changed to `<= StateMutability::View`, for example ASTJsonConverter and ABI.cpp.

Also ASTPrinter sholud be updated for completeness.

I've thought I've changed the ABI (seems like it was gone through some wrong conflict resolution in rebasing), but explained above why I don't think it applies to ASTJsonConverter and ASTPrinter in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2745#discussion_r134258547.
