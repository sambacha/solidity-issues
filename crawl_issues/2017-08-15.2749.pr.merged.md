How about the constructor? I think we had an issue it should only support `public` and as such it must also display the warning?

We agreed that currently it does not make sense to enforce no-warnings on the end-to-end tests (and as such the specifiers should not be added above), because having "too pure" (as in up to latest standards) code would remove the possibility of getting old code tested.
