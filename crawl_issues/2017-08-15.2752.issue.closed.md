# [\#2752 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2752) `closed`: Libraries can have constructors - is that useful?
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
library L {
  function L() {}
}
```

It may seem useless to support this given library functions are invoked via delegatecall and thus is very unlikely to regularly access the state of the library contract.
