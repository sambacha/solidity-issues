# [\#2774 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2774) `closed`: Coverity Scan integration in CI
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

There's a repo on Coverity for Solidity: https://scan.coverity.com/projects/ethereum-solidity?tab=overview

The CI should submit a new Coverity report when the nightly is built. In order to that a report must be built using the tools here (https://scan.coverity.com/download). It seems the tool is quite large (~600 Mb), so preferable a docker image should be used instead (I'm sure someone made one already).

Though many of the issues found by Coverity were found by cppcheck too (at least on that particular build).

You can also start with clang static analyzer.

I've been using it on other projects, but either it cannot find anything or it cannot properly hijack cmake on Mac, because the result I get is always "no issues found".

I can confirm this on a linux build. However, when I run Clang SA with a set of non-default checkers enabled (marked `alpha`), the scan throws up bug reports. So far, most of these bug reports seem to be false positives. It is on expected lines because `alpha` checkers are just that.

The good news is that there are no warnings with production checkers :+1:

How do you run it? Coverity website seems to be down for weeks.

I ran the clang static analyzer, not Coverity. You are right, the Coverity scan service is down atm

In the past Coverity was able to find different issues, but that is experience from over 4 years ago. Since the coverity site seems unreliable, I don't think we'll use it anytime soon.
