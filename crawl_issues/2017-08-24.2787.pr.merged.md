# [\#2787 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2787) `merged`: Adding storage into the pointer for Voter delegate

Hi,

The example from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/solidity-by-example.rst is not working. 

It keeps giving this error in the Mist program:

     Could not compile source code. 

     Variable is declared as a storage pointer. Use an explicit "storage" keyword to silence this warning.
            Voter delegate = voters[to];
            ^------------^

The solution is just to add the keyword "storage" and then the example works again.

@designium note, it wasn't an error, but a warning, just Mist treats it as an error. Issue tracked here https://github.com/ethereum/mist/issues/2797.
