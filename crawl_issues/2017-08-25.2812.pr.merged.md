@axic can this be merged?

Confirmed the output is the same:
```
Source: "contract Test {\nfunction Test(){\nmsg.sender.call.value(0);\nmsg.sender.call.value(0)();\n}\n}"
```

Though it would be more appropriate to use `toString` and not compact writer, because that supposed to be for proper JSON (which cannot be a string). And it also seems to make a copy of the string.

Hm, actually there is such a function, `valueToQuotedString` and it does no copy - it essentially is the same as our escaping.

@chriseth revert the last commit if you don't like it and merge it that way

Ah ok, I saw valueToQuotedString, but I thought it was not part of the API.
