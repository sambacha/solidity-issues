The uninitialized is part of the parsing: https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/commit/90061941390595dbdb71f5f1eb9ccfcdb28d168d

Move: https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/commit/8996c377aad3a333a9bada1cfe7d5924e71a3269

`StyledWriter` and `FastWriter` are deprecated and there's a new `StreamWriterBuilder` class to be used instead.

Likewise, `Reader` is deprecated and `CharReader` is supplied (which has quite a different API).

Would be great to upgrade to newer version of jsoncpp, or the error occurs when installing via homebrew. https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/issues/128

@changwu-tw the compilation issue is tracked in #2956. The problem is it should always use the built in version, but for some reason it uses the external one if present.
