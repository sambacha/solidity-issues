Wait with this. I see a lot of failures.

Not actively.

I have problem with Emscripten - I'm not able to mix C++11 toolchain with Emscripten toolchain. Everytime I touch something related to Emscripten the Travis build fails without enough information in logs... I will go back to this some day, but probably not this week.

@chfast was this problem resolved?

No. Emscripten toolchain is not fully supported by Hunter and you cannot build Boost this way.

@chfast what should we do with this PR in that case?

This should help by using the sane default from Emscripten via the toolchain file.

@chfast can this be finished somehow?

Yes, the idea it's simple: you have 2 toolchain files: one for regular C++11 builds, one for Emscripten builds.

But this not work in practice, because Hunter does not support building boost with Emscripten this way. It requires some work there, probably quite time consuming.

@chfast are you saying this PR should be abandoned or not?

If it should be abandoned, does it still make sense creating an issue and linking here so that someone in the future might pick it up?

@ekpyron here's another CMake PR to think about.

@axic Yes - I like this one. I think we should decide about #4486 first, though - it should make things easier.

@axic Not right now, but looking into this and generally improving the build system is on my list.

@ekpyron @chfast wow this actually works after we've merged the emscripten updates.

The title wrongfully said it [after](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2836#issuecomment-440762815). It needs to be reviewed.

Rebased this and updated to C++14, not sure if it works anymore.

I think the main benefit is to properly (aka cmake style) set the compiler version. @chfast can answer better probably.

Seems to be fine.

This is a way to extend some CMake settings to dependencies. Hunter relay on this. E.g. you can have a toolchain file that configures the build for Emscripten and "magically" whole project will cross-compile with Emscripten.
But this allows you also do something simpler without adding additional options to project, e.g. compile in C++14 mode.

There are my example toolchains: https://github.com/ethereum/cable/tree/master/toolchains
I also have a `-march=native` somewhere for benchmarking.
