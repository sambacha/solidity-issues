This doesn't seem to match EIP615:
```
We tentatively suggest the following opcodes:

0xB0 JUMPTO
0xB1 JUMPIF
0XB2 JUMPSUB
0xB4 JUMPSUBV
0xB5 BEGINSUB
0xB6 BEGINDATA
0xB8 RETURNSUB
0xB9 PUTLOCAL
0xBA GETLOCAL
```

Also it seems you forked off a branch in July, hence the tests are confused (circle).

Okay, rebased, squashed the commits and updated to match cpp-ethereum.

Thanks @axic.  I take it the older branch is not an issue after all?

It was (it had broken tests), but I've rebased it to head.

OK, thanks.  I didn't think that old branch had anything to do with this PR - I created a new branch, changed one file, checked that the PR could merge and thought all was well.  (Except, it turns out, for the invisible spaces.)  Oh well.
