We tried that two years ago, but clang-format did not support
```
x(
  a,
  b
)
```
back then.

A configuration was added in #7240, now we need to reformat everything and run it on CI :wink:

No, still a missing feature in clang-format.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
