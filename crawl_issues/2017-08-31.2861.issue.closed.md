We should reduce the number of AST visits by creating a generic visitor where specialized visitors can register and be called on certain nodes. This might even make use of templates so that visitors can specify which node types they want to be called for.

This might not be too easy, because some components, for example the view/pure checker, require a certain visiting order.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
