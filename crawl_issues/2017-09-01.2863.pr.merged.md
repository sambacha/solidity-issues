# [\#2863 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2863) `merged`: ABI decoder

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-09-01 17:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2863):

 - [x] always check that offset + min size <= size, if possible do it efficiently (i.e. group statically sized types) - reconfirm this, currently we only check `offset < end` and not `offset + size < end`
 - [x] implement struct decoding
 - [x] manual coverage testing
 - [x] clarify if we need to call "interfaceType()" for the decoder types.

Latest version should work for all value types - but does not yet have any tests.

@chriseth can you rebase on top of #2924 ?

Rebased, fixed some stuff, did manual coverage tests and ran against full EndToEnd tests.

The only thing left here is the decoder for structs.

Needs rebasing since the other ABI PRs were merged.

Can some of the commits be squashed? Many just say "decoder", "decoder fixes", "decoder tests" :)

Also need to be rebased and changelog updated.
