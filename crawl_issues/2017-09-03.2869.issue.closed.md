# [\#2869 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2869) `closed`: Calling contract should have ether to call payable function

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8667095?u=d49448efd3eb8d6b5f3bf87e8002708298959a59&v=4" width="50">[aaroncolaco](https://github.com/aaroncolaco) opened issue at [2017-09-03 09:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2869):

When trying the example [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-structures.html#creating-contracts-via-new):
```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract D {
    uint x;
    function D(uint a) payable {
        x = a;
    }
}

contract C {
    D d = new D(4); // will be executed as part of C's constructor

    function createD(uint arg) {
        D newD = new D(arg);
    }

    function createAndEndowD(uint arg, uint amount) {
        // Send ether along with the creation
        D newD = (new D).value(amount)(arg);
    }
}
```


The contract `C` creates a new instance of the contract `D` via 2 different functions:
- createD(uint arg)
- createAndEndowD(uint arg, uint amount) 

In the latter, it uses `.value(amount)` to send Ether to the payable constructor of `D`, but `C` was created without any Ether. 

I think the constructor for `C` should be made payable so that the example works. Otherwise it throws an exception when `createAndEndowD` is called, since C does not have any Ether itself.

I'd like to modify the docs and make the constructor for `C` payable.
