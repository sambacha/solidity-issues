I'm not sure if this adds any value. I almost never take a look at the main page and I would actually prefer to be notified by email if develop breaks...

@chriseth probably not for you, though I've forgotten why I wanted to add it.  I noticed the badge is missing back in June, and the item was staying in my todo list for 12 weeks until now.

Ok, I guess it does not hurt to merge.

@pirapira @chriseth For some reason it seems to refer to the latest pull request.  It shows as "build: error" in the README and the link goes to #2881.

Hmm.  That was not obvious to me.
