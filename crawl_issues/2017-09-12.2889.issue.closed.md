# [\#2889 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2889) `closed`: Overload conflict warnings should not be excessive

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-09-12 10:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2889):

The problem is in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L176-L177.

Errors are reported for each conflicting item, notwithstanding it was already used as a secondary location.

e.g. the source
```
contract C {
  function f();
  function f();
  function f();
  function f();
}
```

will generate 4 warnings, each of those referring to each secondary location. Before #2886 is fixed, the number of warnings is exponential.

Part of #2876.
