# [\#2890 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2890) `closed`: Overload conflict warnings (constructors and functions) should limit the number of secondary declarations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-09-12 10:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2890):

If the conflicting number of declarations is over a certain threshold (lets say 32), truncate the list and include a new error explaining the list is truncated, because there more than 32 conflicts and also display the actual number of conflicts (since it is available).

Part of #2876.
