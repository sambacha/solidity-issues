**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Here I call `keccak256` with too many arguments:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;
contract Test {
    function f() {
        keccak256(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15);
    }
}
```
Unlike other cases when stack is too deep, it will not report the line number etc. Just
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp(927): Throw in function void dev::solidity::CompilerUtils::copyToStackTop(unsigned int, unsigned int)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<dev::solidity::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.
[dev::tag_comment*] = Stack too deep, try removing local variables.

Version: 0.4.16+commit.d7661dd9.Linux.g++
```

Unfortunately a few instances are caught at locations which don't have a source location and as such cannot report it.

If user want to get result of `keccak256(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)`, what can he do? Is there some workaround?

It will be possible eventually, but I don't think we need to keep this issue open. You could also do things like:
```
bytes memory a = abi.encodePacked(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
bytes memory b = abi.encodePacked(8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15);
`keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
```
