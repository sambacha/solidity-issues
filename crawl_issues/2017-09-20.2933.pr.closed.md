**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Updated the comment for create token factory to make it clear that returns don't work on transactions but only on calls. Which is an issue in using factories as a design pattern without storing the resulting address somewhere to be retrieved later.

Why do you think the address cannot be returned?

It can be returned, but blockchain clients do not provide the required tools to also make it visible to the js layer. I think this should be explained in more detail in a paragraph below, and not in the comment. Also, this does not only apply to `address` (the current wording kind of suggests that).

Created an issue to track this: #3128

Closing this as it is not solving the problem properly. @OfriHarlev thanks! Would you be interested in documenting this at the right place?

@axic sure. Where would be the best place to document this?

@axic the main reason I documented it there was that I had read that comment and found it missleading when trying to create a factory and call it using web3
