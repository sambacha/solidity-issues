What is the boost output like in case of an exception? Do we get the exception location (file and line)?

I think uncaught exceptions are reported by line. Note that we never used those macros anyway...

I mean only in very special tests.

I mean it is useful to receive some kind of indication of the exception and if that is only possible with the old one then we should use that. I think we do get *some* information without those helpers so it should be fine.
