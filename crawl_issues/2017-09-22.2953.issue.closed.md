# [\#2953 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2953) `closed`: SMT solver should check assignments to length

It should not be possible to resize dynamic arrays in a way so that they overlap with high probability.

Assignments of the form `x.length = a`, `x.length += a` and `x.length -= a` should always require a "small" value a.

`length` will be read-only from 0.6.0, so closing this
