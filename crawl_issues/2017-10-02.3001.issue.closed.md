**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

I tried adding `pragma experimental SMTChecker;` to the top of this file:
https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/blob/develop/source/contracts/Controlled.sol

However, it errors with the error below when I try to compile it.

```
joeykrug:~/workspace/source/contracts (develop) $ solc Controlled.sol --bin
Unknown exception during compilation.
```

Removing the SMTChecker line it compiles fine, seems to be an issue with the SMTChecker.
