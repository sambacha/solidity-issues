# [\#3002 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3002) `merged`: Test to make sure that LLLC is compiling all valid opcodes correctly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3411040?u=844b395af5047da2a24a73116b3011f9c872696b&v=4" width="50">[jwasinger](https://github.com/jwasinger) opened issue at [2017-10-02 03:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3002):

AFAIK `SHA3` is the only opcode not currently implemented in LLLC.

Some of the instructions are lowercase while others are uppercase. Also having `return` after every one of them seems not very useful. Any reason for these?

Thanks for the review.  Have a long day of flights today.  I will address these points tomorrow.

These were pulled directly from a state test I wrote: https://github.com/ethereum/tests/blob/develop/GeneralStateTests/stTransactionTest/Opcodes_TransactionInit.json .

Makes sense to re-write that as well.

Having two tests (one for good opcodes, one for unused opcodes) is sensible here.

Needs to be rebased for latest LLL fixes.

@axic I revised the test simplifying the code, added the use of `toHex`, rebased off develop.

Thanks @jwasinger. I think the functional tests were useful too. Not sure which one is used in test generation though.

Also all these should move to `test/liblll/Compiler` from `Parser`.

I am not sure which one is used in ethereum/tests, `(asm)` blocks or functional instructions? If the latter, having tests for them cannot hurt.

I added a test for functional instructions.  I think it should be ready to merge @axic

I also added opcodes for environmental ops like (BLOCKHASH, TIMESTAMP, etc.)

Rebased, indented, sorted instructions by opcode number and changed all parameters to be 0 to aid comparing the opcode itself.
