# [\#3005 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3005) `merged`: lll: do not expose push/dup/swap/jumpdest as functions

Depends on #3004.

They are still available in assembly: `(asm 0 DUP1 SWAP2)`

The reason here is that none of these can be used meaningfully as each function starts its own stack frame and that means the only way to call it is `(SWAP2 0 1)` which is translated into `PUSH 1 PUSH 0 SWAP2`

Hm, should this include jump/jumpi too?
