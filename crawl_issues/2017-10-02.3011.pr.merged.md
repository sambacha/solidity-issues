# [\#3011 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3011) `merged`: Adds better error message for fractional array size expressions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18387287?u=731c7dd6ee0b0893495e80299d0849c4d09e826b&v=4" width="50">[wadealexc](https://github.com/wadealexc) opened issue at [2017-10-02 22:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3011):

Part of #1259. For array size expressions like [3/0], the compiler now displays the message "Operator / not compatible with types int_const 3 and int_const 0". In addition, for array size expressions like [3.5], the error was changed to "Array with fractional length specified."

Can you please split this into two changes? The fractional case and the div-by-zero case. For the latter also a new test case is needed.

This PR doesn't need to be closed, most of the fractional code is in here.

I see you've created the change on the `develop` branch. I think it is useful if on your fork you start using multiple branches, because then you can submit multiple change requests (one per branch).
