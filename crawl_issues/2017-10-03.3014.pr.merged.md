@chriseth can you check why every other location check is fatal?

For some it might make sense, but an error that the default is dangerous does not have to be a fatal error, because we have the default.

It turns out there is not a single non-fatal error in there and many of them do look like they could be non-fatal. I guess it was only throwing before the new error reporting refactoring was done and it was never revisited.

@chriseth updated but we should review the rest at some point
