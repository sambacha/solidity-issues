# [\#3016 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3016) `closed`: Fix file missing error message on imports.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315234?v=4" width="50">[q3k](https://github.com/q3k) opened issue at [2017-10-03 17:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3016):

Trying to convert an import path into a Boost canonical path causes
boost to throw an exception if the given file does not exist. Thus,
instead of geting to the 'File not found' error, we instead got into the
cath-all handler for 'Unknown exception in read callback'.

This change rearranges the file checks to happen before we create a
canonical Boost path. It also drive-by removes the unnecessary 'else'
block, as the body of the if is a guard-like return block.

@chfast Mind taking a look at this one, too?

The reason it was ordered that certain way is to not give away information such as file not found if it is in a restricted path, but it doesn't really seem any way around it to fix this problem.

Indeed, we should always first check if the path is allowed or not.

@q3k can you explain the bug this pull request fixes? In its current state it cannot be merged because it makes solc expose information we do not want to expose.

It fixes the problem that `canonical` will throw an exception if the file doesn't exists.

@axic ah thanks! This is weird, because I remember having thought about that problem.

Would a solution be to canonicalize only if the file exists? But then people would still be able to detect if some files outside of the allowed directories exist or not.

Boost 1.60 has `weakly_canonical` which is exactly what we need, but I think we can only afford 1.57 for now.

@q3k do you have any suggestions how to solve this with the restrictions we have?

@q3k do you have any time to look into this issue? It would be nice merging your change once finalised.

I'll take a look later this week, sorry.
