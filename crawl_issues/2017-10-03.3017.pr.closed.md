A short section on overflow rules by the different operators, for signed and unsigned integers.

I think there's another small section about overflow already (which explains what conditions can throw).

seems there is also an error at `%` in signed numbers table.

edit: yeah, seems i forgot to move 'x' after i merged rows to put multiple related operations in the same row.

hmm should probably add a note at signed `%` though, to let people know which implementation is used.

@axic I know there is a short section on truncation and some stuff, under 'solidity in depth -> types -> integers', but not much there about overflow. I still thought this would be more appropriate to put in misc tho, as an appendix.

Could you add a short paragraph explaining the difference between (or perhaps even defining) overflow, underflow and truncation?

@chriseth i will add definitions, and also distinctions between wrapping and over/underflow.

I made a few more updates. 

1. Removed the `-INT_MIN = INT_MIN` note from the tables and gave it a special section in the introductory notes.
2. Removed the "truncation" term entirely, and instead use "clamped" when bits are being truncated. Don't want to mix it up with truncating decimal parts of floats.
3. Added a few lines about casting and demotion.
4. Added a warning that points out over/underflow is not detected. Maybe it should be more verbose, but that normally means that it is not checked for, or treated as an error. Also, the Z3 module seem to check for this at compile time; maybe that should be included as well.

I could add that there are several related tests in the (extended) test suite for the libraries i'm working on - which also contains a simple Math library that has a few functions for doing exact arithmetic.

Can the commits be squashed a bit and rebased against`develop`?

definitely. this is on hold tho because christian suggested tables are turned into paragraphs, and potentially there will also be a list of invariants included. also need to know if under/overflow in bit operations should be changed from "no" to "undefined" (all except shifts, since they are multiplication). 

Personally i am in favor of using undefined, which means there are three cases for each "flow direction":

1. yes: it is possible for the given operator with the given input.
2. no: it is not possible for the given operator with the given input.
3. undefined: it is not meaningful to talk about under/overflow with the given operator.

Undefined is only used for unary `+` now (since it's being removed).

Rebased this to avoid merge commits to ease the review process.

@androlo how about squashing some commits and merging this?

this is old and has been edited a lot so i removed it.
