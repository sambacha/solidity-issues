@kasjan-s sorry, this fell under the rug a little. Do you still want to work on this?

Sorry, I was moving last week, and as a result this fell low on my list of priorities.

I'll get back on it this week asap. If you guys are getting impatient then of course don't mind me.

Don't have time to pick this up again right now.

Closing for now to reduce clutter.
