Realised that z3 has the same problem so perhaps we should do this in the `SolverInterface`, though in the case of z3 it is of a smaller issue because that is compiled together with Solidity so any issue is spotted instantly, while with SMT, the file might be transmitted, processed and transmitted back, so it makes sense to spot issues earlier.

Yes, this should be part of the interface. Also: For now, the assertion is fine, but soon we also want to see the values for non-integer variables, e.g. bools.

@chriseth current version of the Z3 code uses a map for constant/function names, which does the same assert due to duplicate key will be refused by the map.

Basically Z3 part does everything this PR does for the SMT interface, i.e. this should be merged.

Ok, let's merge it for now, but I think we should rather pull that up into SolverInterface later.
