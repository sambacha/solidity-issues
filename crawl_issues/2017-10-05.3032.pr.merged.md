# [\#3032 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3032) `merged`: Division and unary operators for SMT checker

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-10-05 15:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3032):

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2993

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3021

It turns out, z3 implements truncation for signed division differently. It seems we have to add our own division.

Fixed signed division by turning it into unsigned division. This seems to be the best solution since using quantifiers seems to quickly reach the limits of an SMT solver and the other option, `define-fun` is actually just a macro for exactly what I did there.

Please rebase this after merging #2993.

Build fails as it needs to be updated after the `sort` change.
