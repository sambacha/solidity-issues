> In some locations we use (x + 31) / 32 * 32 for rounding, but (x + 31) & ~31 should be a bit more efficient because it has only one constant.
> Also add that rule to the optimizer.

I don't think so.

`mul(div(add(x, 31), 32), 32)` -> `and(add(x, 31), not(31))`

Or are we thinking about a generic rule:
`mul(div(add(x, a), b), b)` -> `and(add(x, a), not(a))` where `b == a + 1`, `b >= 1`, and `b` is a power of 2?

could also be more generic

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
