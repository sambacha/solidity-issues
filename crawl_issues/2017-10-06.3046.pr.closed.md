This is a quick proof of concept I made for an improved `solc` error output. Further improvements would require a richer error API, but I wanted to get a feel for the general direction and anticipate possible drawbacks first.

The style is somewhat inspired by the `rustc` compiler messages.

**Example:**

A way needs to be figured out how to deal with the Javascript side of things because all the colors are transmitted there too.

We would have to test, but the `termcolor` documentation says this:

> By default, Termcolor ignores any colors for non-tty streams (e.g. std::stringstream), so [...]

I actually was thinking about a flag to enable/disable it in the StandardCompiler, because it could be converted to colour output in Javascript, e.g. with libraries like https://github.com/drudru/ansi_up

Long term, I think we should invest in a rich JSON error format for non-terminal clients to consume. Any rich terminal formatting is unlikely to do well outside of a tty and clients may be tempted to parse it into shape, which will generate resistance to change later.

We do have the rich JSON error format. But the formatted version is added for ease of use of the consumer (if it doesn't want to implement everything again).

This looks wonderful!

I think we should only use colours with `solc` and only if stdout is a terminal. What does `rustc` do if you use `rustc |& vim -`?

solc-js could also use colours if it is used on a terminal.

Ah and another thing: There is a license string somewhere that lists all files that are not GPL. If we add this file, it has to be included in that list.

We can do that, `termcolor` supports a `colorize` flag that forces colors even in non-tty streams.

> I think we should only use colours with solc and only if stdout is a terminal.

This is the default behaviour. I just checked it to make sure.

I would have to generate an Emscripten build to test this. I have no idea how to do it though.

> If we add this file, it has to be included in that list.

Good. I will do that.

**Question:** Is there a better place to put the `termcolor.h` file? I just dropped it there to test things out, but I guess we should place it in some `include/` directory and configure CMake appropriately.

Ah, I see, termcolor.h checks `isatty` internally, so it will not work with emscripten, I guess. Is there a possibility to also inject the ansi escapes into strings? And will those strings when handed over to `console.log(x)` in nodejs produce color?

@chriseth yes, we can easily force colorization for non-tty streams with `termcolor::colorize`.

**Edit:** OK, question was more complicated, I will take a look.

@federicobond can you rebase please?

Also I think this could be split into multiple features:
- colouring
- extended underline (`^`)
- the left hand `| ->` stuff (btw, what is the number there?)

I'd suggest we add a configuration setting to the jsonio so that coloured `formattedMessage` output can be disabled: `settings: { ansiColouredErrors: true }` (default `false`)

@axic I was looking at the code and I think that we have reached a point where it may make more sense to convert those static functions to member functions and move the stream and any configuration inside the Formatter class.

This will clean up the method interfaces and make testing easier. What's your take on this?

I was rebasing and playing with it just yesterday. I may have some time to split parts of it in the weekend. Severity enum and coloring seem like good candidates.

I have begun splitting this PR with #4338, which contains the Severity enum changes, but I think that doing the coloring and then changing the output would be zigzagging towards the final result too much. Once the Severity enum is merged, the resulting diff should be much easier to review. What do you think?

NVM, I am splitting colors from the rest because there have been lots of changes to the file after the initial patch and I am worried I will miss one.
