# [\#3053 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3053) `merged`: Replace biddingTime with auctionEnd in auction example
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/799573?v=4" width="50">[wjmelements](https://github.com/wjmelements) opened issue at [2017-10-08 20:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3053):

#### Rationale
It is better to compute the auctionEnd once during contract creation than to compute it every time someone bids. It is also better to not store unnecessary information on the blockchain. I found these issues distracting while learning Solidity.

#### Change
SimpleAuction does less computing for each bid by retaining the more-relevant auctionEnd instead of auctionStart.
SimpleAuction drops its now-unused biddingTime variable.
BlindAuction drops its already-unused auctionStart variable.
