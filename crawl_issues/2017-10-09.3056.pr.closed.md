I successfully managed to get an experimental version of remix working with your docker container! Wohoo! :-)

I'm still a bit uneasy about including binaries into docker files. Since in contrast to go, python is usually part of every base image of a distribution. Would it be possible to write the http wrapper in pyhton and include the script itself?

Nice! I'll try to supply a python version by tomorrow ;-)

Hi @chriseth, sorry for being away for a while, I've updated the image to a version based on python. Should be small (95 MB), CORS-enabled and based on python.

Sorry, I'm closing this, we are not sure if this is the route we want to go. Thanks for you work anyway, we might pick it up in the future!
