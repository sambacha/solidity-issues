# [\#3060 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3060) `closed`: Modifiers add to stack, discourages modifier usage
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

I assume there's nothing that can be done about this, but I was surprised to see that the following contract doesn't compile because each modifier is added to the stack:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

contract Testing {
    modifier a(uint256 x) {
        require(true);
        _;
    }

    function foo(uint256 x)
        public
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
        a(x)
    {
        uint256 aa = 22 + x;
    }
}
```
Error: 
```
browser/Testing.sol:27:27: CompilerError: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.
        uint256 aa = 22 + x;
                          ^
```

For methods with many modifiers and a lot of variables, it means that people will need to write functions to do their checking instead of modifiers in order to work around stack depth issues. Like this:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

contract Testing {
    function a(uint256 x) {
        require(true);
    }

    function foo(uint256 x) public {
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        a(x);
        uint256 aa = 22 + x;
    }
}
```
Is this expected behavior?

Yes, that is expected behavior. Since modifier wraps the function like a decorator, the variable x which is pushed into the stack at the beginning of the call to `foo` must remain available until the `_;` returns.

You showcase an interesting case though, and I think there is a simple optimization to be made here, which is to pop modifier local variables when the `_` statement is in tail position.

There is a more general case to be made for incorporating liveness analysis into the compiler, as long as it can intelligently balance stack/gas tradeoffs.

We are not planning any such optimizations at the high level language layer, since the benefit / danger - ratio is just too low.

I think it is good to keep this open as a reminder. With the new IR it should be possible to move some of the arguments into memory to accommodate this (or evm1.5/ewasm would actually allow way more arguments).

@leonardoalt @chriseth @ekpyron I think with the new scoping rules this could be improved in certain cases.

Not really, because modifiers generate a block that surrounds the function.

My code is now a lot uglier because of this

I know this is low priority but feel like it should be re-considered. At least in the case where `_;` comes at the tail-end..

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
