Thanks! Can you please compare this with #2431 which is another sample code for the same?

@axic Thanks for pointing it out. But that's a sample code and here is the one I created one for `Payment restrict to only sender or recipient`.

Please review this PR.

Sorry @amitkumarj441, I am not sure what do you mean by `Payment restrict to only sender or recipient` ?

@axic I mean it's for Payment Channel.

@amitkumarj441 sorry I am still confused about differences between this and #2431?

@axic This PR is an improved version of #2431. @VoR0220 is already reviewing this PR.

To me this seems to be a code from scratch, not an incremental improvement over #2431.

I think having the state enum in #2431 is very useful. This PR also should adhere strictly to the coding guide as seen in https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html

This is a fairly basic one, I do think there are things that need to be altered in terms of a modifier (an enum works too frankly for state transition steps), however I did find it to be a tad more complex in terms of the details. Thorough would be the correct word but harder to decipher.

@VoR0220 Okay. Alright.
So, any decision on this PR?

Not my decision to make.

I am sorry, meanwhile #4212 was merged which achieves the same goal. Closing this now, but if you feel that the current merged chapter could be improved, please do not hesitate to open a PR for it.
