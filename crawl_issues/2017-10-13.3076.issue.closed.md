# [\#3076 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3076) `closed`: Build fail: "Unable to determine commit hash. Either compile from within git repository or supply a file called commit_hash.txt"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303693?u=c4017c4404bcb708819e6a2603499b4338a43ea0&v=4" width="50">[giacecco](https://github.com/giacecco) opened issue at [2017-10-13 15:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3076):

Not clear if this is an issue or intentional. Trying to build 0.4.17 from source - not from the git repository - I get the error you see below, interrupting the _make_ stage. The problem does not happen if I actually create the ```commit_hash.txt``` as suggested. Perhaps you want to force the user to find the real commit hash, in case she downloaded the source code from a malicious source? Thanks.

The compiler version string includes a part of the commit hash, so you have to get it to cmake somehow. Either you build directly in the git repository or you use the archive attached to the release page: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.4.17/solidity_0.4.17.tar.gz or you create a file called `commit_hash.txt` in the root of the source directory.

About the potential attack: I don't think there is anything we can do if users compile software they download from somewhere else.

Got it, not a security feature, just a way to be absolutely crystal clear with the user of the binary about what exact version she's using.

The commit hash is used to have a proper version number. Please use the archive that is provided as an artefact in the release.

Either you build directly in the git repository or you use the archive attached to the release page: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.4.17/solidity_0.4.17.tar.gz or you create a file called `commit_hash.txt` in the root of the source directory.

how to  create a file called `commit_hash.txt` in the root of the source directory? I mean where is the root of the source diretory
