# [\#3077 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3077) `merged`: Assume peephole optimizer was successful if number of pops increased.

Without this change, the "OpPop" method is not really effective, because it just replaces an operation by a pop and does not decrease the number of operations.

I vaguely remember having implemented that before, but either it got lost in a merge or was removed deliberately...

Failure is hash mismatch in soljson.js.
