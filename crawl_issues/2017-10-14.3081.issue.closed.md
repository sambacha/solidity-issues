# [\#3081 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3081) `closed`: visual studio + solidity +deployment issue

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32796826?v=4" width="50">[divz1010](https://github.com/divz1010) opened issue at [2017-10-14 14:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3081):

I have installed a local deployment via docker of Strato Management.
I am trying to setup the BlockApp to deploy custom contracts from Visual Studios:

prompt: Enter the name of your app: TestApp
prompt: Enter your name: test user
prompt: Enter your email so BlockApps can reach you:
prompt: apiURL: (http://strato-dev4.blockapps.net2) http://localhost1
prompt: Enter the blockchain profile you wish to use. Options: strato-dev, ethereum: (strato-dev) ethereum

I’m not sure what I should put for the blockchain profile.

I can then do bloc start and the server runs, but when I deploy sample code from VS I get the following:

PS C:\Users\Chris Mills\source\TestApp> bloc start
bloc is listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000
api is pointed to http://localhost1 with profile ethereum

Then the service crashes and I have to restart it. Is there something I’m doing wrong here?
please let me know
how I can resolve this

This seems to be unrelated to Solidity. Please open an issue on the framework you are using.
