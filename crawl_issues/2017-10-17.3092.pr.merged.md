Shouldn't this have a changelog entry? Also can we squash the commits?

Yes, you are right about the changelog entry. Squashing should also be done, but can also be done as part of the merge in github.

@rivenhk will you add a changelog entry?

@rivenhk thank you. I restarted the failing test (the failure looked unrelated to the PR).

@pirapira I hoped the first 3 commits would have been squashed given they do a lot of back-and-forth changes (not you can also do that from the merge interface)

@axic I knew, but I didn't have the chance to do that.  It's already merged.

@pirapira sorry, it was @chriseth doing it.
