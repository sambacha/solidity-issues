Please provide a bit more detail, such as the compiler version, the environment (IDE, tools, etc), your OS, etc.

I taken the bitecode code from **remix** onlline ide and deployed this contract in parity 1.7.0 node.

That would mean the error is shown by Parity and should be reported to Parity then.

I think 0xfd is `REVERT`, as I ran across similar output while pumping some problematic bytecode through https://etherscan.io/opcode-tool

Also [this](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c61610302aa2bfa029715b534719d25fe3949059/libevmasm/Instruction.h#L195).

Chances are Parity 1.7.0 doesn't support this new opcode.

@akshay951228 please add a pointer to the report to Parity.

Please reopen if issue persists. It doesn't seem like a Solidity issue.
