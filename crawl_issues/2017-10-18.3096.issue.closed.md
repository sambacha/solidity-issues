Solidity is the official language for smart contract. I used this language for just a little time. So can this language process images or can it support libtary like OpenCV?

This question is better asked at https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/ but in general, smart contracts and blockchains are not meant for such purposes. You  might get it working via tools like truebit, though.
