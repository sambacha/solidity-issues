Closes #1677.

Follows https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/

Thanks! Can you please add tests that (assuming we strictly follow PEP-0515):
- trailing underscores are not allowed (in both decimal, hex and exponential)
- underscores within the exponent part is allowed (`1e3_00_0`)
- leading underscores in decimals (disallowed by PEP)
- consecutive underscores are not allowed in any of the places where underscores are allowed

Deviating from the PEP I'd argue that leading underscores in hex are a nuisance.

Also please update the documentation (search for "rational and integer literals").

Also there's this rule in the PEP:
> For the b, x and o format specifiers, _ will be allowed and group by 4 digits.

e.g. `0x1_2_3` is not valid, but `0x1234_5678` is

I agree with you that 0x_abc looks weird and not consistent with disallowing leading underscore for decimal numbers.

> Also there's this rule in the PEP:
> For the b, x and o format specifiers, _ will be allowed and group by 4 digits.
e.g. 0x1_2_3 is not valid, but 0x1234_5678 is

My understanding is that this is for the _output_ format specifier, when converting from number to string. This is not a constraint on the syntax of a numeric literal. The [grammar](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/#literal-grammar) given does not specify this constraint.

I am working on adding the tests and disallowing leading underscore. Is this additional grouping constraint really needed?

@axic  I have added more tests and docs.

I also tried in python3.6 and it does allow arbitrary grouping of digits.

e.g. `x = 0xab_cd_e_f` is valid

Even the PEP introductory section suggests that. I think it definitely is a better idea to enforce that (we can always lax the rules, but harder to make them strict once out in a lax version).

@axic  Ok will do this then. 

Just to be clear the following will be invalid:

0x_abcd_cdef (leading underscore)
0xab_cd (not grouped by 4)

What about the following?
0x12345678_9abc - one group of 4 has underscore but other doesn't.
0x123_4567 - The total number of digits is not divisible by 4.

Good questions!

> 0x12345678_9abc - one group of 4 has underscore but other doesn't.

I guess this is fine too (I would personally not allow it, but I guess could be used to show where the fixed point would be after conversion? Tiny use case though). Perhaps this is the point where lax rules gain ground.

> 0x123_4567 - The total number of digits is not divisible by 4.

I think this is fine.

@axic Thanks One more question :)

Since we are allowing 0x123_4567, should we allow 0x1234_567 too? I think allowing only one of these 2 makes sense (and will make implementation slightly easier).

Hi, I am thinking about the best way to implement this. I think this rule will cover all the cases. Or do you want more restrictive ones?

* The number of digits to the *right* of each underscore should be a multiple of 4. 
* And ofcourse, no leading, trailing or double underscores

This will take care of all the above cases. But it will also allow such cases:
`0x12341234_123456781234_abcd`

Due to our ambiguous handling of literals, we should allow both `0x123_4567` and `0x1234_567`. The first makes sense if used in a number context, the second if used in a `bytes32` context.

Ok, perhaps to complicate things even further:

If the literal ends in 4 hex digits without separator, the length of the first element is irrelevant. If it starts with four hex digits without separator, the last element has to have an even length. So `0x1234_567` would be disallowed, but `0x1234_5670` would not be.

I'd argue that in a number context one could say leaving the leading 0 nibble out is acceptable (as it is a number), while in a `bytes32` context it isn't since that refers to actual bytes.

`0x1234_567` is very misleading, because even in a `bytes32` context it will be assigned as `0x01234567...0`.

Exactly! Although the "context" should not influence whether the literal is valid or not, it should be visible from looking at the literal itself.

I can't follow you, you say `0x1234_567` should be allowed because it makes sense for `bytes32`. I do not think it makes sense for it at all.

Looking at `bytes32 x = 0x1234_567` I'd get the impression that it will be `0x12345670...0`, but it will be `0x01234567...0`.

Also I'd say the parser should not enforce any rules (perhaps apart from stray leading, trailing underscores), but rather have it in the SyntaxChecker.

Reason:
- better error reporting
- perhaps less code (could use a regular expression there).
- and easier to describe it in `grammar.txt`

@chriseth  @axic , is the following rule fine?

* If there is a semicolon in hex numeric literal, then it should be before every 4th digit from right.

How about in RationalNumberType::isValidLiteral in Types.cpp file?

@axic great idea about syntaxchecker! This would also automatically allow the parsing to continue in case of an error.

@Balajiganapathi I would prefer the following rule:

If there is no separator at all, it is fine.
If there is a separator, the number of hex digits between separators has to be exactly 4 and special rules about the part before the first separator and after the last one are:

If the literal ends in 4 hex digits without separator, the length of the first element can be arbitrary. If it starts with four hex digits without separator, the last element has to have an even length. If neither the first nor the last has 4 hex digits without separator, the literal is invalid.

Sorry to nitpick, but somehow I have the feeling that the parsing logic can be even more simplified.
We try to model the regular expression `[:digit:]+(_[:digit:]+)*` right?
Shouldn't this be possible with something like

```
do
{
  if (!isDecimalDigit(m_char)) return;
  while (isDecimalDigit(m_char)) advance();
  if (m_char == '_')
  {
   advance();
   if (!isDecimalDigit(m_char)) { rollback(1); return; }
  }
}
while (isDecimalDigit(m_char));
```
