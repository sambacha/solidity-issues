> If the current block ends with the EVM terminating (STOP, RETURN, ...), avoid memory writes if we can infer that the memory is not accessed anymore.

@chriseth is this still relevant? The yul optimizer should do this already.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
