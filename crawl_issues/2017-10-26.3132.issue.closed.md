Remix tells me: `Constructor must be public or internal`

If i make `internal` I get: `This contract does not implement all functions and thus cannot be created.` ...

What's the purpose and how to use an `internal` constructor ?

Why must a constructor be `public` instead of `external`?

See #2638. Basically it allows an abstract contract to have a constructor, which is used by the child.

Thanks, that's helpful and makes sense.

Any explanation for:
> Why must a constructor be public instead of external?

Idea-wise, if a constructor was allowed to be `external` then that would prevent inheritance?  (There's an issue here somewhere like `final` in Java.)

Hm, I cannot recall any particular reason, but yes, inheritance would be a problem with external constructors.

@ethers would you be interested in documenting the above in the main docs? This question comes up a few times, good have it explained.

@axic I can pick this up if @ethers hasn't yet?

@elenadimitrova yes, please take it, it would be great having this document. @ethers has not expressed interest, it is safe to assume he hasn't started working on it.

Is this the best place in the documentation for that @axic  
http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#abstract-contracts

Shall we roll in #627 here as well?

@elenadimitrova I think it would make sense introducing a new section for constructors somewhere in the *Inheritance* section.

@elenadimitrova Thanks for documenting the reason for internal constructors.
