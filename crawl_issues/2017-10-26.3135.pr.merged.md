# [\#3135 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3135) `merged`: Convert static SourceReferenceFormatter functions to member ones

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138426?u=3117125771b06e3aa8da468c8f41e4038d717974&v=4" width="50">[federicobond](https://github.com/federicobond) opened issue at [2017-10-26 21:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3135):

This cleans up the method signatures and also opens the door to configuring and even replacing the formatter implementations.

The test failure is weird, since this PR should not change that...

@chriseth anything blocking this?

I guess it is fine, but with time I'd like to use StandardCompiler in the CLI too (e.g. to reduce the number of public interfaces we have) and that would mean most of these changes aren't really utilised.

The blocker here was as @chriseth mentioned the test failure:
```

Retriggered tests, maybe that fixes it.

@federicobond it is still failing the tests :(

Tried this locally and cannot reproduce it :(

Okay the problem is the different version of the shell, which emits the `Skipping non-existent input file ""*/*.sol""` warning.

This is the code filtering out the `pre-release` line from the output and ensuring the output is empty afterwards: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests.sh#L75-L81

@axic I did not understand your last comment fully. Is the shell not globbing one of the function arguments?

@federicobond I had that hunch, but then I think it was something else but related, unfortunately had to leave the task and don't fully remember.

I am sure it had something to do with the shell or the script.

This is the output:

```
Compilation failed on:
Skipping non-existent input file ""*/*.sol""
Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
```

The script removes any line containing `pre-release`. If there are any lines remaining in the output it is a failure. Whoever emits that "Skipping non-existent" (it must be the shell as it is not `solc`) is causing it to fail.

Sounds like `solc` is receiving a literal `*/*.sol` as argument. Perhaps shellcheck and/or some reading can clarify.

@federicobond can you try to fix it? Would be keen merging this.

This is so frustrating, the change should have nothing to do with that test failure.

Rebased again, perhaps it will work?

Ok, fingers crossed. I was not able to reproduce it, but I might have the fix. Explanation inline.
