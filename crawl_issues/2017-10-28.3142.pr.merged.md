Fixes #716.

I have extended ConstantEvaluator to support identifiers. It also recursively calls in case of more constant references.

Thanks for this! There should be a lot more tests because this a new feature. You must also ensure the case about pure expressions in constants, such as `uint constant x = keccak256(ripemd160(33))`, which is really tricky because the `ripemd160` part is a `CALL` and unfortunately it is not evaluated once at assignment, but rather every time it is used...

@axic I have added more tests.

Do you mean we should allow such expressions? In current implementation they are not allowed ( I have added a test for that case too).

I'd keep disallowing them so that's great the way it is.

I like powers of two, perhaps 32?

Please include tests for recursion: `uint constant LEN = LEN;` and `uint constant A = B; uint constant B = A;`

I think that's all the comments, should be done now :)

Done @axic :)
