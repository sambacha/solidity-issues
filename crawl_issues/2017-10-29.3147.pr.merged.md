# [\#3147 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3147) `merged`: Suggest alternatives when identifier not found. Closes #3058.

We can use the following method to compute alternatives:

1. When an identifier is not found, look through current and enclosing scopes and compare each declaration name with the identifier name
2. To decide whether two names are similar, calculate the [Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance). This metric considers insertion, deletion, substitution and transposition as single operations
3. If the DL distance is <= 2 and it is less than the lengths of the name they can be considered similar.

@Balajiganapathi thanks these are great! Will do an individual review, but two small mentions (applies to all PRs): no need to use namespace specifier `std` as it is imported and please add an entry to the changelog in every case a bug is fixed (no need to include bug issue number) or a feature is added.

Please include a test for inheritance (suggested name in the inheritance tree).

@Balajiganapathi just a heads up: we'll be busy with devcon this week and it is likely that your changes won't be properly addressed this week.

@axic I have made the suggested changes to this (and my 3 other) PRs.  Waiting for these PRs to be reviewed and merged before taking up more tasks as I don't want to keep repeating the same mistakes :)

@Balajiganapathi will you have some time before next week to check these changes out or should I push changes to this branch?

@axic had a busy week so could not work on it. Will make these changes over this weekend. 
Also, can you tell me where exactly to put the stringWithinDistance in libdevcore? I am not able to decide.

None of the existing files in libdevcore seems to fit. Shall I make a new StringUtils source file for this?

I think it sounds fine, could be more specific too if you find a good name (something along the lines of string similarity).

Please add a specific test for the distance module in `test/libdevcore` (just name the file the same as the implementation file name).

Rebased and made some tiny updates to the branch.

Please use rebasing instead of merging, since it is impossible to review a merge commit.

@chriseth oh I think actually this was waiting for you to review. Can you review the updates? It shouldn't be too hard to finish this one.

Fine part from minor things. I will rebase and fix those.

@axic if tests are green, you can merge at will

Circle somehow fails since it cannot fetch the commit. Since travis is green, I would ignore it.

I guess building from external pull requests doesn't properly work with circleci
