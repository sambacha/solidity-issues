After PR #2749 now examples in documentation produce messages:
> Warning: No visibility specified. Defaulting to "public".

Adding "public" visibility will solve the problem. 

I can make a PR after merge of #3152.

@axic Looking into this one, I'm having some technical issues which I'll investigate, but mostly I wondered if these tests are all contained in the _scripts/tests.sh_ script as it's not completely clear if this includes the docs tests? If so, I might clarify that in another PR.

I think it is done in `test/commandlineTests.sh`.
