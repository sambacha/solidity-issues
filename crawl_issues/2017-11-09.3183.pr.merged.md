@chriseth well, it seems that this was so by design in the parser, but the grammar always understood it with a parameter list. I guess regarding the initial intention it made sense, but since we try to make this less prone to error I'd argue this is the better way.

@axic right, done.

So we ignore that this might be seen as a breaking change for some?

Please adjust some more test cases.

We can postpone it to the breaking release, but I'm yet to see such a contract (I wasn't even aware of it and the documentation doesn't give it as an example).

Seems like Zeppelin fails:
```
Starting our own testrpc instance
Error parsing /tmp/tmp.SSInTQ7ujt/contracts/Bounty.sol: Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
Compilation failed. See above.
```

I restarted the zeppelin tests. Shall we merge as is, or perhaps rebase so that the "prerelease" warning is fixed?

@chriseth the tests seem to be passing?

@federicobond needs to be rebased and the changelog entry be moved. (Also no need to have the issue reference in the commit message).

Seems to have been rebased.  The ChangeLog entry appears in the right place.

@pirapira the last release was 0.4.19. We are now in 0.4.20 unreleased.

So, why didn't I get a merge conflict?

Github only cares if the merge commit applies without conflicts and in that case it did (because the previous release had no bugfix entries). There is a separate option in Github to enforce that every PR has to point to the `HEAD` but that is quite annoying because requires a rebase after every single merge. This is a tradeoff, but requires us to be a bit more careful.

Oh, I see.  Whenever the new changelog entry is far away from `... (unreleased)`, there is no protection.  Sorry.
