# [\#3184 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3184) `closed`: Query style syntax

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8215875?v=4" width="50">[r0kk3rz](https://github.com/r0kk3rz) opened issue at [2017-11-09 13:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3184):

In a multisig wallet scenario, if you want to check that everyone has signed a particular pending transaction you end up doing something like this.

```
    function isConfirmed(uint transactionId)
        returns (bool)
    {
        uint count = 0;
        for (uint i=0; i<owners.length; i++) {
            if (pendingTx[transactionId][owners[i]])
                count += 1;
            if (count == owners.length)
                return true;
        }
    }
```

Which is a rather long winded way of saying 'Everyone needs to agree to this'.

Instead it would be nice to get a bit more declarative and query-like with it.
Eg.
```
    function IsConfirmed(uint transactionId)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return where all owners in pendingTx[transactionId]
    }
```

Which reduces a hand crafted loop with possible off by one errors and other common mistakes into something that in my mind is quite readable and would be great in modifiers

We do not plan to add declarative constructs for now.
