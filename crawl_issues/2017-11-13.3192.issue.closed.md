# [\#3192 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3192) `closed`: Variables can be used before they are declared

I was surprised this compiled:

```
pragma solidity 0.4.18;

contract Sandbox {
    function foo() public pure returns(uint) {
        uint baz = bar + bar;
        uint bar = 10;
        return baz;
    }
}
```

This has been a part of the language for a while.  Actually, a few features
I've written have had to take it into account.  Despite it being pretty
unappealing (to me and you), I'm not sure it can be classified as an issue.

What are the reasons to support the ability to use a variable before it's declared?

Declarations are hoisted in a similar way that JS hoists.

This is being addressed in #1679. I'm closing it as it is part of the language taking its basic scoping rules from Javascript. I'm sure the documentation explains this, but if not please reopen the issue.
