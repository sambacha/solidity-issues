Add another example with ``call`` to demonstrate Re-Entrancy. Since ``send`` explicitly sets gas to 2300 by default according to this commit https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/9ca7472089a9f4d8bfec20e9e55c4f7ed2fb502e which makes it impossible to "get multiple refunds" because a non-zero CALL costs at least 9700 gas. This issue is discussed on Ethereum StackExchange https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30371/send-ether-reentrancy-attack-in-reality-how-could-fallback-function-make-a-mes/30616#30616

Rebased to have the new indentation rules (and trigger compilation tests).
