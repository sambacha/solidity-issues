A semicolon was mistakenly inserted where a string concatenation

Good catch, thank you!

I wonder why the useless statement (`string(";\"");`) was not detected by the compiler. @chriseth @chfast @pirapira any ideas was compiler flags to detect it?

@axic This is probably a new warning in clang6. @kseo Can you send us full warning message?

I don't think there was a warning, but probably we could turn it on with `-Wextra`.
