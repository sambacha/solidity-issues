# [\#3203 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3203) `merged`: Prevent libraries from being called.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-11-14 18:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3203):

Fix for a bug classified as "medium" (up for debate).

Prevents libraries being called directly (i.e. not via delegatecall or callcode) by injecting the deploy address into the code at deploy time. This results in the library's deployed code to start with

    if (this == _injected_deploy_address_) revert();

@axic it seems the zeppelin tests actually call libraries directly.

The overall check makes sense, but those comments seriously concern me. "Make it too complicated to be optimised away" is not a good way to do things.

@Arachnid @holiman the optimizer operates on AsseblyItems. So a solution might be to introduce a new kind of AssemblyItem that is not touched by the optimizer and assembled to `Push20 000...000`. What do you think?

I did not do it at first because it adds a whole new type of assemblyitem for a single special use case, but I guess it's worth it after all.

Long-term, do you think EVM designers might be interested in introducing a CODEADDRESS opcode or similar to get the address of the currently running code? I think it may be useful to distinguish between delegatecalls and own calls in different kinds of situations.

@federicobond I think it would be better to have access to the type of the call itself. Perhaps you want to know if you are inside a STATICCALL or not.

A discussion with @axic yesterday revealed that we are not yet sure whether this is actually the way to go. It is impossible to call libraries directly from Solidity itself, but the compiler generates an interface for the library, so people might call libraries from javascript and the documentation actually never stated that this is not how it is meant.

Also, for security reasons, it could be a good idea to STATICCALL a pure library function instead of DELEGATECALLing it.

If libraries are just not callable from Solidity, but callable from javascript or other EVM code, `library` is a bad feature.  `library` provides an illusion "this thing is not callable" on Solidity programmers while in fact allowing EVM programmers to call it.  That illusion is a source of bugs. In that case, I suggest removing `library` feature from Solidity.

@pirapira you are probably right. Libraries currently generate a json-abi - I guess we should also remove that from the compiler.

Actually I was under the illusion that "libraries" (not the inlined parts) could be used manually, even by contracts written in other languages.

Similarly, libraries written in other languages (e.g. C contract in eWASM) could be used by a Solidity contract.

Too bad the current system doesn't really give any kind of safe guards to either of these use cases.

@axic all functions that are compatible with the ABI specification can of course be used by other languages. Anything that uses storage references cannot be used since this is a Solidity-only feature not covered by the ABI - also we have not yet defined a cross-language storage allocation specification.

What we could do is allow view functions to be called via CALL.

I think a good compromise would be a built in function available within libraries to determine the execution context: `msg.librarycall` ->`PushDeployTimeAddress ADDRESS EQ`

Libraries then could safeguard `selfdestruct` and manually:
```
require(!msg.librarycall);
selfdestruct(owner);
```

Storage modification is already disallowed via the type checker so not sure what other scenarios are there currently with a risk of affecting the "library state".

A more complex solution would be only adding the call preventer to functions with higher `stateMutability` than `view`.

Note to myself: We have to add a test where state is modified inside the fallback function.

Hey, if I'm not mistaken, this PR totally breaks the examples used here : https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/contracts.html#using-for
As libraries now cannot modify the state, half of the methods used with the `using for` syntax will do nothing, without any warning.
Was this the expected behaviour? Should the examples be updated then?

@ngotchac can you provide more details? The compiler only creates code for libraries to be called via delegatecall, so everything should still be fine.

If you try this example:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;
// This is the same code as before, just without comments
library Set {
  struct Data { mapping(uint => bool) flags; }

  function insert(Data storage self, uint value)
      public
      returns (bool)
  {
      if (self.flags[value])
        return false; // already there
      self.flags[value] = true;
      return true;
  }

  function remove(Data storage self, uint value)
      public
      returns (bool)
  {
      if (!self.flags[value])
          return false; // not there
      self.flags[value] = false;
      return true;
  }

  function contains(Data storage self, uint value)
      public
      view
      returns (bool)
  {
      return self.flags[value];
  }
}

contract C {
    using Set for Set.Data; // this is the crucial change
    Set.Data knownValues;

    function register(uint value) public {
        // Here, all variables of type Set.Data have
        // corresponding member functions.
        // The following function call is identical to
        // `Set.insert(knownValues, value)`
        require(knownValues.insert(value));
    }
    
    function contains (uint value) public view returns (bool) {
        return knownValues.contains(value);
    }
}
```
(I just added the `contains` method on `C`) you can verify that the `register` method does not work.
