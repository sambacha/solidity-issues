(From #3173.)

The suggestion here is to not include the complete list of built in types in the grammar, just consider them the same as user-defined types.

It should not make a difference grammar wise, only syntax highlighting benefits from it.

This wasn't done in #3173. That PR prompted the idea.

Even after #8505 this is still the same.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
