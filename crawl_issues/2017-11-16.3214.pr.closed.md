Thanks, that's a very good start!

@chriseth What other places do I need to change besides `TypeType::nativeMembers`?

@kseo you could add test cases first and see what is not working and/or what was broken by the change and track it down from there

Since `constant` can contain expressions (which are copied and evaluated a the place they are used) and refer to other constants it probably makes sense to have a complex test case, such as:
```
contract C {
  uint constant a = 33 * b + 4; // can also mix keccak256(b) into this
  uint constant b = 44;
}

contract D {
  uint constant b = 66;
  function f() returns (uint) {
    return C.a;
  }
}
```

The goal here is to ensure that `b` is looked up from the correct contract when evaluating the constant expression.

This reminds me (it is not strictly related to this PR), but we could add tests for `storage constant` and `memory constant`.

@chriseth this needs to be reviewed

@chriseth I added some more test cases, but indeed cross-contract cycle detection does not currently work. Since this PR was not originally planned for 0.4.22, I suggest that I first continue to review the other PRs and then get back to this, unless you definitely want this in the current release.

Cross contract cycle detection should work now and this is ready for review.

Please add a test case for 
```
contract A {
    function f() pure returns (uint) { return 1; }
}
contract B is A {
    uint constant x = super.f();
}
contract Y {
    function f() pure returns (uint) { return 2; }
    
}
contract X is Y {
    uint constant a = B.x;
}
```
and check what the value of `a` is.

Note that we currently still allow non-compile-time-constant constants - we only add a warning. Because of that I would say this is too dangerous to include in the release.

Did we test accessing `address x = address(this)` from different contracts?

I updated the PR to include @chriseth's test (before the latest changes the test contract would cause a fatal compiler error; now the expected value of ``a`` is 1).

However:
 - In the meantime I agree that this PR should be postponed as long as non-compile-time-constant constants are possible.
 - One might actually argue that in the new ``cross_contract_constants_super_call`` test the value of ``a`` should be 2 and not 1, so this has to be discussed. In general I think it may be a good idea to postpone this PR until e.g. #3157 is settled.

What is the status of this? I am kind of lost.

@axic The current status of this is "postponed". We could think about re-evaluating this now, though.

Closing because it got stale and there are still discussions about the underlying feature.
