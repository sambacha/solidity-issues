This PR contains the following changes:

- Variables that are touched inside a branch are merged into a new `ite` variable after the branches (only for if-else, no loop support), guarded by the current path conditions
- Keep track of current path conditions
- Added `unaryOperator` visit (returning `not implemented yet` warning msg)
- Adjusted SMTChecker tests: now variables are not reset after the branches finish, and the usage of the unary operator `++` returns the `not implemented yet` msg
- Fix precedence bug in `SMTChecker::booleanOperation` (equality over logical operator)
- Typo in some places "satisifable" -> "satisfiable"

I've fixed the other comments (that I haven't replied) and will create another PR to branch `division` (the one that contains the latest changes).

The new PR (for branch `division`) is https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3217 (this one should not be used).

Closing as this is obsoleted by #3217
