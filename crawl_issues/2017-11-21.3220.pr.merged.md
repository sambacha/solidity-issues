# [\#3220 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3220) `merged`: If statement for Iulia / Inline Assembly

This will be much more useful in the ABI decoder (only the encoder is part of develop as of now).

I think this is missing the evm1.5 codegen part?

No, AbstractAssembly handles both of them.

Never mind, it is `EVMCodeTransform` and the if code has no need for evm15 specific stuff.

It is lacking tests:
- printing test
- assemble test
- scope tests (`if iszero() { let x := 1 } x := 2`)
- tests in the julia suite

Though it seems `for` loop isn't covered in the printing test either.

There is and end-to-end test for if - do we have an "assemble test suite"?

`BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(Analysis)` in `test/solidity/InlineAssembly`

Perhaps we're failing zeppelin tests now as they've checking for even warnings:
```
> zeppelin-solidity@1.3.0 test /tmp/tmp.Cblq5apBSn
> scripts/test.sh
Starting our own testrpc instance
Error parsing /tmp/tmp.Cblq5apBSn/contracts/Bounty.sol: Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
Compilation failed. See above.

@axic hm, I fear we have to patch that out, we cannot wait for modified zeppelin code when we introduce a new warning.

Test failures are due to the Zeppelin issue. This should be fine to merge though as everything else works and it only adds the `if` feature.
