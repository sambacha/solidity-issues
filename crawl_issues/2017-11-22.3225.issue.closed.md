From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2129#discussion_r130046385, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2129#discussion_r130046494 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2129#discussion_r130046541.

Introduce memory pointer, storage pointer and address types.

At least conversion from `u256` type to them is needed, e.g. `mpointer(2:u256)` gives a memory pointer type of value `2`.

#3525 should be a solution to this.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
