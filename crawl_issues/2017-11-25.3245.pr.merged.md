# [\#3245 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3245) `merged`: Remove use of solAssert in Jumpdest optimization

#### Background

I was looking into existing LLL implementations, and Solidity's one is nearly perfect enough to use as a standalone library. There is one problem - you can't currently build it without `libsolidity`, because of one line of code.

## Changes

Replaced a use of `solAssert` with an `assertThrow(..., OptimizerException, ...)`.
Removed the inclusion of a `libsolidity` header.

### Reasoning

There's no reason for this to be a `solAssert` - it's not directly in `libsolidity` or `solc`, `libevmasm` is otherwise totally decoupled from Solidity proper, and there's no justification for why this represents a Solidity compiler error instead of a problem with the assembly optimizer directly.

There's not really an explanation for why this illegal state is checked here at all, but I didn't wan't to remove the Exception entirely, because presumably it was motivated by something.

Thanks! That was an oversight added lately.
