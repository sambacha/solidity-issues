# [\#3246 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3246) `closed`: Warning: Error querying SMT solver: No SMT solver available.

I'm trying to follow an example Christian showed at devcon using the command line solc v0.4.18. 

Here's my solidity source code:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract SimpleExample {
    function f(int16 circle, int16 square, int16 triangle) public pure {
        require(circle + circle == 10);
        require(circle*square + square == 12);
        require(circle*square - triangle*circle == circle);
        assert(false);
    }
}
```

Here's the output:

```
$ solc smtcheck.sol
smtcheck.sol:2:1: Warning: Experimental features are turned on. Do not use experimental features on live deployments.
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
^-----------------------------^
smtcheck.sol:8:17: Warning: Error querying SMT solver: No SMT solver available.
        require(circle + circle == 10);
                ^-------------^
.... more errors...
```

Am I missing a flag, or using the wrong pragma?

Solidity needs to be built with z3 available on the system. During `cmake` there should be a line stating whether the z3 library was found or not.

You should see: `Z3 SMT solver found. This enables optional SMT checking.`

Please reopen if it doesn't solve the issue.
