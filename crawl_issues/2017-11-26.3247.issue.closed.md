# [\#3247 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3247) `closed`: Unable to import Solidity contract from a file using `compile_files`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6226175?u=ea7339a04dc8c949afddddadb7067dfaaf493fdf&v=4" width="50">[ltfschoen](https://github.com/ltfschoen) opened issue at [2017-11-26 20:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3247):

**Which version of Solidity you are using**

Solc v0.4.17 (see where I load Solc dependency in my [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ltfschoen/pyethfinality/blob/master/Dockerfile))

**What was the source code (if applicable)**

https://github.com/ltfschoen/pyethfinality/blob/master/main.py

**Which platform are you running on**

* Docker VM on macOS 10.12.6 - Linux version 4.9.49-moby (gcc version 6.2.1 20160822 (Alpine 6.2.1) )

**How to reproduce the issue**

Follow steps in the "Quickstart Guide" of my Github repo https://github.com/ltfschoen/pyethfinality#chapter-0

* Run the Python script in the 1st Bash Terminal tab's Docker shell 
```
python3 main.py
```

**What was the result of the issue. What the expected behaviour is**

In the web3.py Quick Start example code https://github.com/pipermerriam/web3.py, they load the Solidity contract "inline" and store it in variable `contract_source_code` and then compile the source code with `compiled_sol = compile_source(contract_source_code)`, which is then assigned to the `contract_interface = compiled_sol['<stdin>:Greeter']`.
But I want to load the Solidity contract from a "file", so I added `compile_files` to the list of imports `from solc import install_solc, compile_source, compile_files` and compiled the source code with `compiled_sol = compile_files([“./Greeter.sol”])`, but I get the following error on the above mentioned line of code that assigns to the `contract_interface` variable.
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 42, in <module>
    contract_interface = compiled_sol['<stdin>:Greeter']
KeyError: '<stdin>:Greeter'
```
Note: I need to load the Solidity contract from a file so I can implement unit tests.

This really seems like to be a Python question for web3.py so I suggest to raise an issue there.

Please reopen if it is a Solidity compiler issue.

Thanks I've created this issue instead https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py/issues/472
