This is hacky but could do for now.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3244 (hopefully)

Change request to truffle: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-compile/pull/35

If we are including a patch I'd rather patch `node_modules/solc/wrapper.js` as we have way more control over the changes in there. I was however thinking about either creating a wrapper over solc or soljson (the latter is more messy due to the C-JS wrapping).
