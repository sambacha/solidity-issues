```
contract C {
  function C() {
    f();
  }
  function f() internal {
    uint x = 42;
  }
}
```

the code for `f()` will be included both in the constructor and the deployed bytecode.

This is the case even without optimiser.

Ah sorry, it's not... seems to be rather a bug to me...

So the logic in `ContractCompiler` first appends all functions with an external interface and while doing so, it collects all referenced functions and puts them in a queue. `appendMissingFunctions()` then adds the code for the functions in the queue also queueing referenced functions again.

The reason for this behaviour is that references to internal functions in the constructor always create an identifier for the creation-time and the run-time aspect of the function, because the function pointer might be stored in storage.

Currently, I cannot think of a nice way to resolve this issue. The simplest case of just directly calling the function can get rid of the runtime identifier, but it would be rather hacky.

Although, we already do something similar for library member access, I will give it a try.
