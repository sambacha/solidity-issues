# [\#3274 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3274) `closed`: SMTChecker: computation of loop iterations and unrolling while and do-while

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2017-12-03 13:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3274):

New code:
- Detects automatically the amount of times a loop runs, supports `<=`, `<`, `>` and `>=`. This is done by asking `z3` to maximize and minimize the equation, and checking whether the resulting value is the same. If yes, that is the constant difference between the `left` and `right` sides at that code point. **Assuming** (Assumption [1]) the difference decreases once every loop iteration, that is the loop bound.
- The loop is then unrolled that amount of times, and the touched variables merged after each iteration.
- If the loop runs less times than the computed bound the code is sound. If the loop runs more times, there are no guarantees.
- If a constant difference isn't found, the loop body is run once, as it was before.
- Added tests for `while` and `do-while`.

Main changes to existing code:
- Added the `maximize` and `minimize` functions to the solver interface.
- Since the loop condition and body may be visited several times, an `Expression` may now have many  `smt::Expression`. Method `expr` now points to the latest one.

Questions:
- Do we want to keep the check of whether a `do-while` condition is always true/false? I wonder how much help that would actually be to the user.
- In the `while` case, I kept the warning message only when the condition is `false` at the moment of the first condition check, that is, will never go in.
- Do we want a warning message stating that automatic loop bound detection does not support `==` and `!=`?
- I've added a note stating assumption [1] as a warning message. Do we want to keep it?

This PR depends on (or subsumes) https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3217.

@leonardoalt is there a way you could split these changes into smaller PRs?

@axic I actually just noticed that the older commits from the other PR were indeed merged into `division`. I'll rebase and check how the new PR would look like.

@leonardoalt you don't need to close the PR you can just force push over it.

Also I hope we can merge #3032 tomorrow just need an answer from @chriseth on the question there.

Yeah but I wanted to get rid of the old commits...

Actually, I don't quite get why GitHub is placing all those commits from @chriseth under this PR, since they are already in the `division` branch. Going to reopen.

Ok, I see now.
Commits 12f31d8 to acaaccf were from branch `trackVariables`, and were already merged into `develop`.
Commits 8a5f940 to 74814bd were from branch `division`, and are the ones about to be merged by PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3032.
GH shows the commits from `trackVariables` because `division` doesn't know about them.
Since this PR depends on all of them, I guess it's better to wait for `division` to be merged into `develop`, and then create a PR directly to `develop`.
What do you think?

@leonardoalt it should be possible to rebase now since both PRs have been merged

@axic Cool. I guess it doesn't really make sense anymore to create a PR into `division`, since `develop` is the branch with the code from `trackVariables` and `division`. So I'd say it's better to create two new PRs into `develop`, one for the `ite` variables and one for loops (this). This way each PR gets less confusing and easier to review.

@leonardoalt you can change the merge destination in the Github UI. There should be a dropdown next to the merge destination or an edit button.

@leonardoalt just did it myself. Also please always use `develop` as the destination and not other PRs. That is our current process.

@axic ah ok, didn't know that, thanks. Rebased. I'll fix the other PR as well.

@leonardoalt so in what order are these two PRs laid out? Can we split these PRs into smaller bite size chunks?

@axic PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3217 comes first. I can make them smaller, starting with keeping track of the path conditions I think (before the `ite` vars). Should I modify https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3217 so that it starts with simpler code, or create a new one for that?

@leonardoalt:

> I can make them smaller, starting with keeping track of the path conditions I think (before the ite vars). Should I modify #3217 

Cool, having them smaller eases review and speeds up the merging process. You can create a new one for that simple change and then rebase the one which depends on it. I'd like to merge at least two of your bite-size PRs this week.

@leonardoalt is this the next PR in the series?

@axic Yep, still requires some discussion though. If this is supported, I would suggest that the user should have a way to give a general upper bound. @chriseth This could be related to what we talked about some time ago (pre and post conditions).

I need to rebase this PR and work on it a bit, there were multiple changes in the SMTChecker that will affect this.

@leonardoalt is this still a PR to be finished? Is it worth working off this or due to the changes better to start form scratch?

The SMTChecker has been changing a lot, so it's probably better to close this one and I'll start from scratch reusing some code.
