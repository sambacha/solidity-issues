Currently syntax like this is not supported.
```
uint i = 2, j, k;
```

I think this feature may not necessarily improve readability of a contract. Do you have any use cases where this restriction adversely affects the readability of a contract?

No I dont have any such use cases.
It just reduces some typing. But as you said readability might be more important in case of contracts.

@chriseth I propose to close this issue as it goes against the general aim of the language design.

It can be reopened if it receives enough support.

@axic I agree. I was just trying to cut out some typing. Il close this issue.
