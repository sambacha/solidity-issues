#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2017-12-11 19:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3304):

- Added the `implies` operator to the `SolverInterface`.
- Keeping track of the current path conditions.
- Using the conjunction of the current path conditions as implicant for checks instead of pushing the solver. The solver is still pushed/popped for the check, but not for the condition scope.
