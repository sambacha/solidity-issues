# [\#3305 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3305) `closed`: Warn about duplicated super constructor calls

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/138426?u=3117125771b06e3aa8da468c8f41e4038d717974&v=4" width="50">[federicobond](https://github.com/federicobond) opened issue at [2017-12-11 21:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3305):

Mentioned in the audit report from Coinspect available [here](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-audits/blob/master/solidity-compiler/Coinspect%20-%20Solidity%20Compiler%20Audit%20v1.0.pdf).

I think I saw an issue related to this, but I couldn't find it.

I think this should be an error and not a warning given the value from the "first" (aka the inheritance definition) call is ignored.

```
contract A {
  uint kk = 42;
  function A(uint a) {
    kk = a;
  }
}

contract B is A(3) {
  function B() A(5) {
  }
}
```

generates

```
    /* "constructor.sol":71:119  contract B is A(3) {... */
  mstore(0x40, 0x60)
    /* "constructor.sol":25:27  42 */
  0x2a
    /* "constructor.sol":15:27  uint kk = 42 */
  0x0
  sstore
    /* "constructor.sol":94:117  function B() A(5) {... */
  jumpi(tag_1, iszero(callvalue))
  0x0
  dup1
  revert
tag_1:
    /* "constructor.sol":109:110  5 */

      revert

}
```

Also it should do this check for calling the constructor twice without an argument too.

And please include a changelog entry.

Good, I agree it should be an error. I think the case of "calling the constructor twice without an argument" is already covered by other errors, perhaps I'm missing something?

This compiles without issues, don't think it is covered:
```
contract A {}
contract B is A() {
  function B() A() {
  }
}
```

Please add this test too:
```
contract B is A { function B() A() {} }
```

I have submitted a [PR](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/pull/613) for the failing Zeppelin code.

@axic anything blocking this?

@federicobond honestly I don't remember the status of this.

@axic the implementation is finished but it's a breaking change (as the OpenZeppelin failure demonstrates). The change is enforced only within a contract, where it's obvious that the duplicated constructor was not intended or noticed, not across the whole inheritance graph, which would be more difficult.

This just requires a small change to work with openzeppelin: If the base constructor does not take arguments, it is fine to mention it twice.
