 - [x] add out of bounds checks for the old decoder, but only use it for decoding dynamic return data
 - [x] use evm target selection
 - [x] even if we use the current EVM, do not use the new abi decoder by default
 - [x] add a test case for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3516

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3569

This is ready for review.

Decisions to be taken:

 - do we want to enable this by default - some VMs might not have `returndatacopy`?
 - this might lead to problems when the returned data invalid data pointers in the ABI encoding (it still uses the old decoder unless the new is active). It is worse than with calldata because everything will reside in memory and we do not have zero-extension there because we need to copy from memory to memory.

Hi guys. Is it still not merged?

@AnthonyAkentiev someone is impatient there :)

There are still security issues to be discussed, see above.

The first comment above is solved (`pragma target byzantium`), but for the second comment, we probably do not want this to run with the old ABI decoder.

Perhaps we could remove the `InaccessibleDynamicType` in a separate pull request because it should already be covered with an assertion. (Need to verify that.)

Use the old decoder only on statically-sized data or on the statically-sized head of dynamically-sized data. This means returndatacopy is not used with the old decoder.

Should use the new `evmTarget` from #1117.

This is finished, but I still have to untangle the various commits.

Rebased because this diff starts with `abiDecode` being present but couldn't find that on `develop`. Probably this wasn't rebased for a while, but had a lot of other commits and github removed those 
 from the diff because they were merged.

Ah, the problem is Github lists commits in the wrong order (by timestamp), but merge wise `Move the old ABI decoder code` comes before `Simple size check for old ABI decoder.`.

Oh wow that is interesting. I last rebased two days ago.
