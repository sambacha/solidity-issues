It would be cleaner to handle this at output time, when you know how many errors were reported and can say things like: "X errors ommited."

Some clients may also want to exercise precise control over error output.

Wasn't the main point of this report the excessive time it takes to create the errors as opposed to simply writing it out?

In some of the original reports it may have taken up to 2-3GB of memory to keep all the errors :)

Yes, technically you could keep compiling without storing the messages, but bailing out looks like the reasonable choice here.

Oh this was failing a test, but I think that was due to the a momentary RPC issue.

Also, the commit `reindent` should have been squashed to the preceding commit, just left it separate for review purposes :)
