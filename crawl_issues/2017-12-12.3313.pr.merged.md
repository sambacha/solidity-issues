Thanks for the change! Can you please justify why that key is the correct one? :)

This seems to be the right key (at least it is from the same URL the packages are imported from): http://linuxsoft.cern.ch/cern/slc6X/i386/RPM-GPG-KEY-cern

This matches the one proposed in this PR. I'd however prefer to link to this one (as it is within the repo) or include the key verbatim in the script.

@chriseth I can't prove this GPG key file is correct one, I don't even know the original GPG key file content is. I just google it then got this url.I think  maybe including the key verbatim in the script is more acceptable as @axic said.

Perhaps we could include the key fingerprint?

okey, I'll try this, but how can I get the origin fingerprint?

Apparently ` gpg --with-fingerprint -v RPM-GPG-KEY-cern` gives you the fingerprint. Though it is not a nice interface.

Updated the URL to use the file from the same host (linux.cern.ch) as the packages.
