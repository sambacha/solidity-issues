# [\#3315 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3315) `closed`: Fixes the errors in the sample ballot contract

This fixes issue #3061 by adding public visibility identifier to the functions and capitalizing functions which had the same as the declared structs. The contract should not have a problem in compilation now

Thanks a lot for the pull request. You might have been a little late, it could already be fixed now - could you please check? It might be that capitalizing some functions is still left to do. If you do that, please keep the indentation of 4 spaces, otherwise the formatting is wrong.

Yeah I just checked it and that had been fixed but some functions names were not capitalized so I went ahead and did that and fixed the indentation

@nisdas if you want to rebase, then simply force-push to your branch, no need to close this pull request, it will update automatically.
