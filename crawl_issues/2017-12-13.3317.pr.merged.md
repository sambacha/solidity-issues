OK, I think I answered all your questions and in my opinion, the code is rather complicated but should be correct. I will take another look if I can simplify at least the conditions in `parseExpression`.

I think we need to add tests for the strict mode parser, it seems `InlineAssembly` is the best location for that. By having the test cases for all loose/strict cases we can simplify the code (ie. not checking for swap/dup twice, although putting in extra assertions).

I think `onlySinglePusher` could also be eliminated and having an extra check for that in `parseExpression` (the only place it is enabled).

@chriseth pushed my latest change, probably tests don't pass

Fixed by moving the detection some lines down and rebased.
