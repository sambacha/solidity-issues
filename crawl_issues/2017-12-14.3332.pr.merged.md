Depends on #3317 and #3352.

I think I will also add the implementation to this PR, perhaps refining and changing the description in the process.

This should work, but I would feel much more comfortable if we required a conversion to SSA first.

The main downside of SSA is that it requires either a re-unification of variable names or much more logic in the assembly stage (which I would rather avoid). Also it might destroy debug information about the stack location of local variables.

Perhaps we could try to keep some relation between the different variants of the same variable (i.e. by suffixing every variable by  `_i`) and then write the reunification in a way that re-using variable names that have the same prefix is preferred.

I think this PR doesn't even need the last two commits ("References counter." and
"Use external variable reference counter component.") because those are part of the #3351?

Needs to be rebased.
