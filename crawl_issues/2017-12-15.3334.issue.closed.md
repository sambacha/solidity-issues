# [\#3334 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3334) `closed`: Yul object format

Implement object format as defined in https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/julia.html#specification-of-julia-object

More specifically:

 - parser for "object"
 - parser for "code"
 - parser for "data"
 - built-in functions `datasize`
 - built-in function `dataoffset`

@axic could you please confirm that this is what we want? I would not implement `datacopy` for now, as it has to use `calldatacopy` at construction time and `codecopy` at runtime, which might be a bit too confusing.

Actually the above statement is not true. The constructor code is available as code.
