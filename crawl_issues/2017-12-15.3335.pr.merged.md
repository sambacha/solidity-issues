@chriseth  Hey sorry, something went wrong with my rebasing, I wanted to drop my last two commits and add a fresh one. But I pushed to my branch before adding the new one, so the pull request closed. Here are the changes you asked for; I capitalised the variables instead of functions. This should stop the warnings from the compiler

Is this in line with the coding style guidelines we have?
