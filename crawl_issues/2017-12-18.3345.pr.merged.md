# [\#3345 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3345) `merged`: add clarity to destructuring assignments with leading comma

Coming from Javascript, destructuring in Solidity with a leading comma confused me because I initially thought `(,data[3]) = f();` meant discard the first value and get the second value, which would be `true` in this example.  (Which would fail because `data` is a `uint`).

But this doesn't seem to be the case because destructuring in Solidity with a leading comma tells the compiler to destructure from the right side.

Thanks for the added clarity! We are about to remove that feature due to similar confusions, but good to have it until then.
