Fix for issue with very large exponent values causing CPU blowout. Exponent values now restricted to max of 1232 ( rational(1) << 4096, approximated.) It should also be noted that values above E78 are causing casting errors:

`biginttest.sol:6:11: Error: Type int_const 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256.
c=1E78;`

Do you want to handle things like `10**1000000` in a second pull request?

Oh I'm sorry, I forget something: Could you also add a line into the Changelog.md file at the topmost section under 'bugfixes'? Something like `Type Checker: Limit the size of the exponent in scientific notation of number literals.`

Could you please rebase this? There is a conflict in the changelog.

Also can you please squash some of these commits? There appears to be a couple of them with the same commit log.

@chriseth @axic Requires re-review. I tried to squash the changes before committing. Somehow unable to resolve conflicts in the browser. Will try that again tomorrow.
