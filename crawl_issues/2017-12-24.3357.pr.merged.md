The pseudocode for the parser remains obsolete, but at least the definition now resembles the current implementation of assembly syntax.

I think the one in `julia.rst` should also be updated.

As a separate work we should also consider how to simplify the documentation and the grammar, because there are now 3 copies of the assembly grammar.

I am not super familiar with the syntactic differences between Iulia and inline assembly, is there some place I can look that up? 

What I have so far:
* Support for user defined types in inline assembly

Two differences:
- some of the constructs (label, instruction, stackassignment) are disallowed and
- identifiers and literals contain a type

I just checked the Julia version and it's much closer to the implementation that what we have right now for inline assembly. Should we merge this now and then try to consolidate the different grammars?
