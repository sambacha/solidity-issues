Tests seem to be fine, so I think we can merge this.

@federicobond sorry I haven't responded yet. Will want to run your tests with code pre-change to see it has the same effect (it should, just want to double check).

@axic have you had time to test this?

@federicobond no. Do you want to push the tests as a separate PR? That should accomplish the task.

@axic there is a single new test case that is not related to the nonfatalness of errors. I opened a pull request for it [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3451). Not sure if that's what you had in mind.

I actually just meant pushing the test commit from here separately, to run tests on it. The result should not change with this PR. Did that locally and they are fine, so we can merge this as is.

@chriseth are you happy with the test coverage or is it still missing something?

Fails on the same seemingly unrelated Zeppelin error.
