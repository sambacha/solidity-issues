# [\#3364 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3364) `merged`: Revert with reason

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-12-30 13:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3364):

Part of issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1686

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3373

I went with encoding the reason string as a function call to `Erorr(string)`, including the function selector.

Still to do:

 - [x] the same for ``require()``
 - [x] documentation for ``require()``
 - [x] forwarding of the reason string by the caller together with bubbling up the error
 - [x] tests for forwarding reason string for weird cases like create and transfer.

The reason we might not want to forward the reason string is that it allows a called attacker to consume more gas in the caller (because the caller needs to copy the return data), but I think this is an acceptable "risk" given the benefit that the error string shows up in the transaction receipt.

Is the string returned regularly, right? In terms of forwarding the return data, would this work https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/blob/dev/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol#L9

To clarify: lets just use `Error(string)` and replace the current encoding, but do not change any other part of the PR (e.g. do not add the internal error messages yet).

@ekpyron alex was mainly concerned about the general concept of how the error string is encoded. What do you think?

@chriseth I think ABI-encoding as a function call to some error function makes sense. I was wondering about the ``Error(string)`` signature and whether it should be a different name, resp. different for ``revert`` and ``require``, but I think using the same makes sense and the name ``Error`` makes sense as well.

Were there any specific concerns? What would be the alternative? Just returning the encoded error string directly?

If I understand https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838#issuecomment-379238333 and the connection to this PR correctly, it seems to me that the current concept makes a lot of sense.

If the concern is about whether to use something like ``Error(cstring)`` or ``Error(bytes)`` instead of ``Error(string)`` to save space in the encoding, I think the fact, that ``Error(string)`` is more natural and it is the signature I would usually expect for a function accepting a string, is more important than saving the space. Especially since in the future the concept can be extended by specific errors with different signatures that may be more space-efficient, following https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838#issuecomment-379238333.

Failure in appveyor is just bytecode upload and thus can be ignored.

I think prefixing a specific 4-byte sequence allows us to extend the encoding later, while at the same time it does not reduce usability since it is fixed for now. Also, it is better than just prefixing a certain number of zeros, since it already suggests away how to extend it to encode different types.

I would opt to merge it :)

The test case `bubble_up_error_messages` does it for a regular external function call, `bubble_up_error_messages_through_transfer` for transfer and `bubble_up_error_messages_through_create` for create....

That's weird, I have seen revert_with_cause and require_with_message, but not the bubble up ones. Anyway, they look correct.

How to read require/revert error string from failed transaction log? (ERROR_TEXT in example above)

I know that maybe is not the right place but I've not found any references or examples so +1 to @vsdigitall. I think that the reason string is in the output as hex in the failed transaction. But I've been not able to fully test this thing.
