# [\#3366 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3366) `closed`: Can the compiler replace MOD with AND when possible?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7003246?v=4" width="50">[barakman](https://github.com/barakman) opened issue at [2017-12-31 17:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3366):

The cost of `%` (5) is higher than the cost of `&` (3).

When `x` is a power of 2, the expression `a % x` is equivalent to `a & (x - 1)`.

When `x` is also a constant variable, this replacement can take place during compilation.

Can the compiler do this when optimization is enabled?
