# [\#3371 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3371) `closed`: Can the compiler replace MOD with AND when possible?

The cost of `%` (5) is higher than the cost of `&` (3).

When `x` is a power of 2, the expression `a % x` is equivalent to `a & (x - 1)`.

When `x` is also a constant variable, this replacement can take place during compilation.

Can the compiler do this when optimization is enabled?

We can probably easily add this in SimplificationRules.cpp:144.
Do you have a real-world example contract? I'm asking because the gas savings are not too apparent for all constants:

MOD is 5 gas, AND is 3 gas, so it looks cheaper, but note that if `x` is a power of two, then `x-1` might be much harder to represent. Also, zero bytes are cheaper in transactions than non-zero bytes. On the other hand, `x-1` might be one byte shorter than `x`.

A real-world example contract:

```
    uint256 private constant ONE = 0x010000000000000000000000000000000;

    function func(uint256 x) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 integerPart = x / ONE;
        uint256 fractionPart = x % ONE;
        ...
    }
```

The constant optimiser should be able to reduce both `0x010000000000000000000000000000000` and `0x00fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff`.

After some empirical testing, it actually does reduce it, but they are kept until different expected run thresholds (on a particular example).

`0x010000000000000000000000000000000` is reduced when expected runs are < 40:
```
exp(0x2, 0x7c)
```

`0x00fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff` is reduced when expected runs are < 30:
```
sub(exp(0x2, 0x7c), 0x1)
```

Since the default value is 200, it is very likely it won't be reduced and the deployment cost will be higher due to the non zero values. Still it means a saving during runtime, especially useful within loops.

@barakman your example though will not save a huge lot, given the function likely won't be inlined even if you use it within a loop.

@axic the optimiser will try to find a different representation of the constant, but it does not have a rule that says `MOD(a, b) -> AND(a, SUB(b, 1))` if `b` is a power of two.

I know it doesn't have a rule, just wanted to figure out what it does with the constants.

I actually added the rule too to see how it works.

Can you create a pull request?

I can, but it will need changes.
