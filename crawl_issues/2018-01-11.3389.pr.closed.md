So 6 tests are failing, all to do with fixed point types. These seem to be failing to to the changed check in FixedPointType's constructor. This brings up the question of how the check should work.

@meowingtwurtle ok, I think now I understand the issue with the constructor / the reason why we did not have a check before: Is there a real reason why we want `1` to be always part of the range of a fixed point type? People might be ok with `fixed8x50` if they only work with very small numbers. Would that be counter-intuitive?

Could you please also add some tests that cause overflow (or are close to overflow)?

Also, code that is not tested is the code that performs explicit type conversion between different fixed point types and also integers and fixed point types. Overflow tests there would also be nice.

 - signed overflow
 - overflow of types which do not utilize all the 256 bits, especially signed
 - explicit conversion from fixed point to int (sorry if you already have that, but did not find them with a quick glance)

I do not support the addition of fixed points to Solidity. I think this is a presentation-layer issue. Just like `printf()` formatting is not in scope for Solidity, I think non-integer types are out of scope.

I am confident that this feature will make contract auditing more difficult and will lead to lost money in the real world.

If people want to use a convention of 10^18 is one unit then they should use the `finney` and `ether` keywords which work very well and are well understood.

@fulldecent if it's a presentation layer issue, why is safeMath so necessary to denote decimal places in an ERC20 exchange? This isn't for the purpose of ether necessarily as it's moreso for the application layer itself ala trade.

SafeMath addresses only integer overflows. Overflows are not presentation layer.

I am not aware of any feature of SafeMath that relates to the number of decimal places.

That's kind of my point. Overflows are addressed here inherently based on the types. This helps not only with presentation but also just logically speaking if we were going to be doing percentage mathematics. The feature makes the job easier, not harder, to audit would be my argument back to you. In addition the extra mathematical properties it provides enables greater financial applications would be another argument I would extend to you.

Also, every language has features that you don't technically need to use. Think about arrays. Technically, at least for storage arrays, you could just use a storage pointer in solidity. In some other languages, you could just use pointers to iterate through memory addresses.

Fixed point types are not limited to 18 decimal places, that is the default setting though, similarly how `int` and `uint` are aliases to `int256` and `uint256`, `fixed` and `ufixed` are aliases for `fixed128x18` and `ufixed128x18`.

@fulldecent can you explain your point in more detail? Is it just a generic "as few features as possible" reason or do you have specific concerns?

The lack of fixed points is generally seen as a missing feature. My argument was always that fixed points can be added using library functions, and there actually is a library: https://github.com/NovakDistributed/macroverse/blob/master/contracts/RealMath.sol

The other argument is that `x * y` is just easier to read than `Lib.mul(x1, x2, y1, y2)`.

My complaints are general and are specifically:

* The documentation is unclear.
* There are no examples.
* There are no test cases.
* Multiplication is undefined.
* When multiplication is defined it will need to deal with rounding.
* When multiplication is defined this equation will not hold `X * 10 * 0.1 == X`.
* There are other ways do to this already, the demand is not well motivated, and the solutions that users will choose depends on their application. Prove me wrong, link to a list of mainnet contracts that are using RealMath!

I spoke at a conference last weekend and beginners are already confused enough with reentrancy. I asked my co-panelists "what is 200 + 200 in Solidity" and they answered 400 (correct answer is 144). Before we introduce yet another caveat on common sense (X * 10 * 0.1 != X) let's carefully evaluate the demand for standardization of this approach and whether we are painting ourselves into a corner.

I can tell you personally that the demand has been there from within and from outside the community for years. This is partly my fault for not getting it done at an earlier date and then falling behind with other priorities. I think it would be a shame for @meowingtwurtle 's efforts to be shot down so easily when we are so close to getting this highly demanded feature over the line. 

Regarding your other points. IIRC isn't rounding already a solved problem when it comes to multiplication of fixed points? I know we can work on scaling and precision but that's for numbers at the tail end that would round off (and I'm not certain we should be hyper concerned about that in a 32 byte word system...but the edge cases are indeed worrisome...still this is basic computer science we are talking about here). 

Easy fix for the 0.1 problem is to just throw a warning whenever the constant between 0 and 1 is utilized. 

(also, your 200 + 200 claim is wrong....I even went and double checked it because I was wtf-ing after I read that)

The demonstration of demand (citing deployed contracts on mainnet) should be well documented as motivation for changing the language.

I have not shot down this work. I have raised objections which are overcomeable. Some are difficult to overcome.

Multiplication is not solved. This is why we do not have floating point numbers in Solidity, among other reasons.

Warning on numbers between 0 and 1 is wow.

If we need to make a decision about rounding for multiplication then this should be the highlight of our discussion here. Including examples of contracts deployed on mainnet that are using Mul(a,b,c,d) functions as above. And also including a discussion of other use cases which might have a problem with the proposed solution.

The time to consider changes to a language is after a careful analysis of the current and proposed usage is considered -- not after some code has been written.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.4.21;

contract Add {
    function test() external pure returns (int total) {
        var a = 200;
        var b = 200;
        return a+b; // returns 144
    }

    function test2() external pure returns (int total) {
        var a = 300;
        var b = 300;
        return a+b; // returns 600
    }
}```

@fulldecent your arguments suggest that people are not used to fixed precision arithmetics, which I would doubt. We could solve the `x * 10 * 0.1 == x` issue by extending the type with each operation, but then people still have to deal with trimming the type as soon as it gets larger than a word. After all, this is a programming language and not mathematics (and even mathematics has its pitfalls with notation).

@chriseth @fulldecent I did some testing. It appears that, because of the encoding that is used (stored as multipled by 10 to the power of <decimals>), that your equality will hold for certain numbers. `x * (1/a) * a == x` will hold for all numbers a such that both `a` and `1/a` are terminating decimals in base 10 (size constraints not withstanding, so the 18th decimal place would be lost for `ufixed128x18`).

Yes, this includes `0.1 * x * 10 == x` and even `32/5000 * x * 5000/32 == x`.
However, this does mean that `(1/3) * x * 3 != x`.

This is all fractions in simplest form such that both the numerator and denominator prime factorize into only 2's and 5's.

@axic Made requested changes, although it occurred to me that there are no tests for shortening fixed point types. I'll add those now.

Question: should we have implicit conversion between `intM` and `fixedMx0` ?

If `fixedMx0` is a permissible type, sure. But, I don't see why it should be. It is functionally equivalent to a `intM`.

It is. Please add a test for it too :)

I'm not sure if it makes sense, but it may... though it will require a lot more tests because then in many cases a common type can be derived when doing binary operations with fixed point + integer types.

[Following is my opinion, if you want something else, that's fine]
I think that if a developer elects to use a `fixedMx0`, that they have forfeited use of bitwise operators. `fixedMx0` shouldn't be treated any differently than other fixed point types.

> I think that if a developer elects to use a fixedMx0, that they have forfeited use of bitwise operators.

Sorry, I meant any arithmetic opration taking two operands, such as addition of `fixedMx0` and `intM` would find a common type and would be allowed. Because of that, probably is a bad idea (at least initially) to allow implicit conversion between `fixedMx0` and `intM`, even though there's no information loss.

The question then is: do we need `fixedMx0`?

@chriseth why is that? What is missing in this PR?

Also how should we proceed with this. I think we're slowly getting closer.

I think there are two non-awful options here regarding `fixedMx0`:
1) completely disallow it **[what I prefer]**
2) completely treat it as an alias to `intM` (at the parser level) _maybe unnecessarily complicated_

Rebased.
One tiny semantic change: require cleanup for fixed points if op is Exp, even though Exp is not yet permitted, just so we don't forget in the future. Let's see if the tests pass!

No progress, mainly but not only because of the discussion happening here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/409

This will probably only be implemented with the new yul-based code generator.

Closing since we are moving on to yul.
