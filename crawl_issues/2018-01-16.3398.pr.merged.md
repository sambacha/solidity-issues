In general, I welcome this change. We only have to check whether it adds another executable to the debian / ubuntu builds. lllc should be its own package and not a binary that is part of the solc package.

Sounds good. Let me know if there is anything I need to do to help.

I'm pretty sure it will just install lllc as well. If you know debian/ubuntu packaging, you can take a look at `scripts/release_ppa.sh`.

@axic good catch -- addressed.

I don't know much in regard to packaging, but if you feel like more has to be done here in that regard I can take a look. Just let me know.

@chfast I have removed the quotes in `lllc/CMakeLists.txt`, but did not address the quotes that remain in the corresponding part of the `solc/CMakeLists.txt` since that is out of the scope of the changes being made in this PR.

As a compromise, we could probably change this so that `make install` does not install `lllc`, but something like `make install lllc` installs it. Not sure if that is possible.

There are 2 solutions for this in CMake:

## Don't build lllc by default.

1. `make` (does not build lllc)
2. `make install` (would install solc without lllc because not built)
3. `make lllc` (will build lllc)
4. `make install` (would install solc with lllc because built)

I think this is rather confusing, because `make install` behavior changes depending on what you have currently built. If you want build lllc but not install it you have to remember to remove it before `make install`.

## Use `install(COMPONENT)`

1. Specify different "components" for solc and lllc, e.g. "solidity" and "extra-tools".
2. To install single component, you have to do `cmake -DCOMPONENT=comp_one -P {your_build_dir}/cmake_install.cmake`. Not very beautiful, but works.

We can also have a combination of both.

Can I propose a third option where there is a CMAKE option to specify whether `lllc` should be included in `make install`? I went ahead and updated the files to show the changes that are required to support this.

`cmake -DLLLC_INSTALL=ON ..`

> cmake -DLLLC_INSTALL=ON ..

Yes, this is good idea. However I'd call it `INSTALL_LLLC`.

I'm fine with whatever name you and @chriseth agree on.

@Matthalp a cmake flag is a good idea! I think we can actually default it to install lllc and then add the setting in the scripts/ppa_relaese.sh:

```

override_dh_auto_configure:
        dh_auto_configure -- -DINSTALL_LLLC=Off
```
But someone would have to test that :)

@Matthalp can you make the changes to the release scripts to turn off installation (as mentioned by @chriseth)?

The change is easy, but I still have to sit down and test it locally. I'll try to do that by the end of the weekend.

Interesting thing: most of Solidity manuals say "if you have installed solc you've already had lllc also".
However lllc is absent in Ethereum PPA and it can't be installed via source code compilation without manual intervention.
BTW both of them solc and lllc take a part of compilation and making. Onnly one difference is installation: it works only for solc.
Why it is important? It is only yet another one compiler for contracts. What's wrong with addition of it to standard make install?

@axic @chriseth Where do you stand based on the comment from @xemuliam? Should I exclude `lllc` from being installed as part of the Debian package or not?

Yes, lllc should have its own debian package.
