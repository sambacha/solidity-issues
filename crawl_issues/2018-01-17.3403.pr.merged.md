# [\#3403 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3403) `merged`: Made install_deps.sh safe to use on Arch Linux

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9366031?v=4" width="50">[xManusx](https://github.com/xManusx) opened issue at [2018-01-17 08:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3403):

After cloning the repo, I saw that in `scripts/install_deps.sh` installing dependencies  in Arch Linux is done with `pacman -Sy ...` which is discouraged in the [official Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Installing_packages) as it can lead to dependency issues and break the system.
