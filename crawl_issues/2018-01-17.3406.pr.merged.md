# [\#3406 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3406) `merged`: SMTChecker: A little refactoring on SSA vars (preparation for Bool)

The idea is to remove the SSA reasoning from the SMTChecker class and do it somewhere else, in this case, symbolic vars of each type have their own classes.

The code isn't ready to merge (still not fully documented, debug, etc), but I wanted to start a discussion. Some points:

- Is the code separation reasonable? :+1: 
- Where should functions `minValue` and `maxValue` stay?
- A pointer to the solver (`m_interface`) is passed to the var. :+1: (reference)
- Variables are now pushed and popped inside branches. :x: (copy instead)
- Zero and default unknown values are now defined in the specific var type class. :+1: 
- The addition of support to `Bool` should be easier now.

While I think this goes into a good direction (especially when we add more types), the way push and pop are implemented still looks suboptimal, since we always loop over all variables. Also it looks to me that maintaining a single stack for each variable is not the best approach. Would it be possible to rather create a copy of all variables at the point where we push and only maintain a pointer to a shared "next free sequence number" for each variable inside the variable instance?

Good, that's exactly what I thought at first. I also dislike pushing/popping all the variables all the time.
The reason why I didn't implement it as a copy right away is that the derived type of the variable is only known at runtime, therefore a few casts would have to be used to infer this type and allocate a copy, and I wanted to have as little specific type reasoning as possible in the SMTChecker class. But well, I guess it's still better than the variables being pushed/popped.

Implemented with copy.

@chriseth Current thoughts on this? It is currently implemented as we discussed last, with the `SSA` and `Symbolic` parts of a program variable being separated and copied accordingly. It doesn't mention anything about `Bool`, but it's prepared for it (I'm writing `Bool` support in another branch, based on this one).
