It's quite subtle and confusing that the ordering of the inheritance declaration changes between the first and second examples in these docs. 

I've added a comment which guesses at the reason for this, but it might not be the right approach, and the author's intent might be something different, or not to have reversed them at all. It's not clear to me that the different functions are meant to run in a specific order.

You are right, the point if this example is introducing `super` and not reversing the order of the base contracts. Thanks for noticing!
