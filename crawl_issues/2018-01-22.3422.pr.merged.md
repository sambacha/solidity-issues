# [\#3422 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3422) `merged`: clarify `address` in function selector

I found that the canonical form for `address` in computing the function selector calldata tag is `uint160`. Update the abi specs to explicitly mention this.

@chriseth is the canonical form for `address` really `address`? I had to change it to `uint160` to work. Can make a small test case if needed.

Yes, `function f(address x)` and `function f(uint160 x)` are two different functions.
