# [\#3425 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3425) `merged`: Deprecate the var keyword in SyntaxChecker

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/675633?u=5573ef6636004e09038c1c12127bd8dafd2394f5&v=4" width="50">[jevogel](https://github.com/jevogel) opened issue at [2018-01-23 16:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3425):

Fix #3301 by extending `libsolidity/analysis/SyntaxChecker` with a visitor for `VariableDeclaration` where the `typeName` is empty (means "var"). The compiler emits a warning for such instances, unless the experimental mode V050 is turned on, in which case it emits an error. This addition causes 7 errors in SolidityTests due to their use of the `var` keyword.

Thank you!

Can you please add test cases (in `test/libsolidity/SolidityNameAndTypeChecker`) and update the change log?

Sure. Should I do anything about the existing test cases that are failing due to their use of `var`?

Please fix them :)

The ones which are specifically made to test `var` should use `CHECK_MULTI_WARNING` or something similar and must keep the `var` keyword.

In cases it is used by mistake, it should be replaced with a proper type (probably there aren't any cases of this).

I wonder whether it might be better to already do that at parsing time, but I guess the problem is that we do not yet have access to the pragma at that point - is that correct?

Yes, pragma is evaluated later. But this should be fine.

I edited all test cases that were failing to check for the `var deprecated` warning. However, it looks like some of these might require modification to replace `var` in them because otherwise the test will not be checking what it should.

If you could take a look at the changes and let me know which test cases should be reworked, I can take a shot at it.

Made some progress on fixing the tests, but ran into some problems with the `ViewPureChecker`. Here are the errors I'm getting when running the tests: [gist](https://gist.github.com/jevogel/7371648e77dc7157a0e0e00716f80ea9).

I am a git noob and inadvertently polluted this pull request with a ton of commits from `develop`. Should I just close this PR and start over?

Please don't close. Just run `git rebase upstream/develop` if `upstream` is the upstream.

Assuming you're local git copy has `origin` as your repo, then do the following:
```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ethereum/solidity
$ git fetch upstream
$ get rebase upstream/develop
```

I did the rebase but all of the commits are still showing up in the history of this PR. Is that a problem?

It seems to be correct for me. Refresh github a few times, sometimes it can take a while.

Awesome, that worked. Thanks for your patience!

Started https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3479 to allow searching in a set of errors.

All tests should work now, but we still need to take a look at the expectations:

Some tests now search for "var is deprecated", although what they actually should do is check that there is no other warning apart from "var is deprecated".

We should change the 'multi-error' feature such that we list all errors/warnings that occur (i.e. the exact same set), and not only search for one to be present.

Rebased onto the new multi-error testing framework. Will adjust the expectations tomorrow.

@chriseth was it intended to drop all the other changes it had? I assume all of that was obsoleted by the new framework.

Yes, it was intended, I would rather restart adding the expectations instead of going back and forth in the previous commits.

Made the bear minimum changes required in tests. Many other tests could be cleaned up too.
