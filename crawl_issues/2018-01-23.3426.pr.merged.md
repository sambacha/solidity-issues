Thanks for clarifying the version number, I wasn't 100% sure and didn't want to edit in the wrong one.  

Though I appreciate that it's not required, I think the link to the GitHub issue where this was decided is appropriate, as somebody will be following old code/tutorials with `constant`, run into a problem, and want to know when and why the change was made.  The hyperlink is a big step toward answering such questions without any additional screen real estate or reading time.  Also, there are plenty of other links pointing to that issue from other places saying the same thing.

Squashed, rebased and reworded.
