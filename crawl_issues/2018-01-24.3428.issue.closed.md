# [\#3428 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3428) `closed`: Compiler should complete even if contract is not fully implemented

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=499298f335f6f4f2b2498c3510275590dd8e67fc&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) opened issue at [2018-01-24 01:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3428):

Currently, the compiler will not run if contract/interface methods are left unimplemented.

Instead the compiler should run if there are no syntactical/grammar errors.

Why? Because the compiler parses NatSpec and NatSpec is useful even for incomplete contracts and for interfaces.

Please verify that is the case with the Solidity commandline tool (`solc`). Not sure what exactly "will not run" means, but the screenshots only show fields (apart from the `methodHashes`) which are relevant for bytecode output.

Remix IDE related issues should not be reported here.

Thank you @axic, I have followed your advice and confirm `solc` DOES work as expected. Closing issue. Adding notes. Reporting downstream.

TEST CASE:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

/// @title A simulator for Bug Bunny, the most famous Rabbit
/// @author Warned Bros
/// @notice You can use this contract for only the most basic simulation
/// @dev All function calls are currently implement without side effects
interface BugsBunny {
    /// @author Bob Clampett
    /// @notice Determine if Bugs will or will not accept given food
    /// @dev Food must be provided in UTF-8 format
    /// @param _food The name of a food to evaluate (English)
    /// @return true if Bugs will eat it, false otherwise
    function doesEat(string _food) public pure returns (bool);
}
```

COMMAND:

```sh
./solc --devdoc --userdoc bunnyint.sol
```

OUTPUT:
