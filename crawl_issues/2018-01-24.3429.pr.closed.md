# [\#3429 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3429) `closed`: Correct notice about which macOS versions are supported

This PR does not change any code. The code already shows Sierra is supported. I have changed just the message to show that the unsupported version is High Sierra (aka macOS 10.13, the next version after Sierra).

@axic Thank you, corrected. Now Sierra is shown as supported and the High Sierra is the work in progress.

I'm not sure though what "work-in-progress" means there :)

Do you by any chance have High Sierra? If so, does it work out of the box?

I have High Sierra and it works out of the box with the instructions provided. (I just overrode the version check.)

I will create a separate PR in a moment to fix that. This PR is zero risk so you can merge now. That PR will be higher risk so more people can review it further before merge.

I'll go with the other one. Someone at this point would've complained if it wasn't working.
