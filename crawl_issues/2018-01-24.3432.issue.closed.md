(Originally tracked in https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/84781120)

Also see https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/91.

The idea is to have a decompressor during deploy time in the "constructor" (just like self extracting ZIPs and the 624 packer worked). This could save on deployment fees (but only if the input didn't contain a lot of zeroes).

Unlikely though this will produce usable results in the near future, it still may be a fun project. However, should gas costs increase, this will be become more important.

Actually I think I have seen an lz decompressor in EVM at some point by someone...

Yes, it is linked in the EIP linked above :)

But it is quite outdated, uses `call` for memcpy. It could be implemented much better in Julia.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
