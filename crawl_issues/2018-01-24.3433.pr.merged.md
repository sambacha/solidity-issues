As explained in "Multiple Inheritance and Linearization" part, "a simple rule to remember is to specify the base classes in the order from “most base-like” to “most derived”". So "contract Final is Base1, Base2" means Final is derived from Base2, derived from Base1, so the final inheritance sequence should be, starting with the most derived contract : Final, Base2, Base1, mortal, owned.
