# [\#3442 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3442) `closed`: Interfaces: require external visibility

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=499298f335f6f4f2b2498c3510275590dd8e67fc&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) opened issue at [2018-01-28 17:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3442):

The [Ethereum ABI specification](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html) does not make a distinction between `external` and `public` functions. Therefore the `Interface` keyword likewise should not so distinguish.

Currently `private` and `internal` are disallowed in `interfaces`s.

For clarity, only `external` functions should be allowed in `interface`s.

@axic why did we not disallow public in interfaces?

I thought it only supports `external`. I think it only should support `external`.

Removing the visibility specifier would be a bad idea because we require it everywhere else (starting 0.5.0) and that would create an exception, which could be confusing.

Understood, issue updated

Actually it seems this is a duplicate of #2330.

This issue regards requiring `external` in `Interface` functions. 

Issue #2330 regards subclassing ("implement"?, "overriding"?) interfaces with a public function.

Right, it seems to be a mix, though there's this also: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2330#issuecomment-333915829

Actually #3038 has implemented this a while back for 0.5.0 mode.

We can however make `public` a warning now (that change allowed `public` in non-0.5.0 mode).
