By default Apple's clang defines a stack size of 8MB, some tests require more.

This is a very simple solution for issue #3460.

Somehow I would prefer to ensure that all supported toolchains will define a 16MB stack - this  change will just define the stack-size for darwin clang to be 16MB. It looks like that the stack-size definition for the gnu toolchains seem to be version dependent and need to be tested very well. So I decided just to focus on the darwin clang use-case.
