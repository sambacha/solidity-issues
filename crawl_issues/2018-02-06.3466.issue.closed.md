> What the expected behaviour is

I expected compiled code not to have the following redundancies:

- "PUSH 60 PUSH 40 MSTORE" during contract creation helps to reserving memory buffer to copy contract code, but why 2 words more than needed?
- Why one needs this code in the fallback function at all?
- STOP after RETURN, which never ever gets reached.

I am trying to better understand how Solidity/EVM works and what is the purpose of these artefacts.

The compiler does not focus on optimizing artificially short contracts. That being said, we could probably detect whether a function uses memory at all and only initialize the free memory pointer for those. This might result in longer code, though, and thus would be a trade-off between deploy time cost and run time cost.

The free memory pointer is at `0x40` to have the first 64 bytes as a "scratch area" which does not have to be allocated.

The stop after return is inserted as a safety measure in case the code does not end with a 'return'. We should probably replace it by an InvalidInstruction instead.

I understand

I thought EVM is obliged to halt execution RETURN. Is there any practical scenario of this happening?

It just appends a stop all the time, it does not inspect the bytecode (just in case this inspection might also be broken in some way).
