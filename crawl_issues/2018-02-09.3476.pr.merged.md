# [\#3476 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3476) `merged`: C99/C++ scoping rules

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-02-09 15:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3476):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1679 and #2495.

Still to do:

 - [x] update ExpressionCompiler tests
 - [x] only activate new rules for 0.5.0
 - [x] for loops: make body and post-expression sub-scope of init statement
 - [x] documentation
 - [x] check that `int a = a` is impossible. (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2495)
 - [x] check that `{ a = 7; uint a;}` is impossible.

What should be the semantics of the following snippet? With the current scoping, it will create an error, but only a warning with the new scoping, because in the new scoping, it is shadowing and not redeclaring. With the current implementation, though, the assignment `(*)` will assign to the second variable, not the first. I guess at least that last behaviour should be fixed.
```
uint x = 3;
{
  x = 2; // (*)
  uint x = 8;
}
```

It is debatable whether we want to support shadowing.

That sounds like a bug.

Yes, I hope I just fixed it.

Sorry, changed it again because a similar functionality is needed in another PR.

This is ready for review.
