# [\#3480 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3480) `closed`: Compiler doesn't recognise declared variable scope

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246085?u=a3d30f1fb6e86f52cfba5b20d7d3da957054b3d3&v=4" width="50">[radek1st](https://github.com/radek1st) opened issue at [2018-02-10 13:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3480):

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract ScopeBug {

  struct MyStruct {
    uint amount;
    address target;
  }

  function outOfScope() public {
    if (false) {      
      MyStruct memory st = MyStruct(0, address(this));
      st.amount = 100;
      st.target = msg.sender;
    } else {
      st.amount = 10;
      st.target = address(this);
    }
  }
}
```
The declaration of `MyStruct st` happens inside of `if` branch that will never execute. Yet, other parts of the code reference `st` and the code still compiles in Remix (0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05.Emscripten.clang). I would expect the compilation to fail.

It is not a "bug", but by design. It follows the Javascript scoping rules.

This will be changed soon with #1679.

Closing this as it was covered with multiple issues before.
