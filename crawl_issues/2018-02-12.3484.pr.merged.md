This is most likely related to my loosening of the fatal reference resolving errors. No changelog entry is necessary because it has not shipped yet.

Did you check whether there are other similar errors? In general, the whole code assumes that `.type` is always present at a certain stage, but I think your changes only concern the reference resolution, because we do not do type checking if there was an error.

I tested some other cases and could not find additional errors. Iâ€™ll keep an eye on it though.

The surface area should indeed be limited to the reference resolution stage.
