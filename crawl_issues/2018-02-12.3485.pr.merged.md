Did somehow zeppelin switched back to and old truffle?

```

This is weird. Does that mean it uses the wrong compiler binary?

I somehow suspect that truffle dynamically loads solc.js over the network if we have node 8, but uses a local copy for node 6. Can that be?

According to truffle, no. It uses a fixed version of `solc-js` and that's it. Currently 0.4.18.

Zeppelin fails with:
```
Starting our own testrpc instance
writeStringToMemory is deprecated and should not be called! Use stringToUTF8() instead!
Error parsing /tmp/tmp.axRDH0fXqQ/contracts/Bounty.sol: Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
Compilation failed. See above.
```

This suggests somehow we did not manage to replace `soljson.js` properly since the `writeStringToMemory` issue should not be displayed.

This is still failing. 

```
 > zeppelin-solidity@1.8.0 test /tmp/tmp.XNkOEKmOCp
> scripts/test.sh

```

The reason is that zeppelin still uses an old version of truffle which in turn uses and old version of solc-js :(

Asked in the zeppelin slack.

@chriseth @axic we have plans to upgrade to the latest truffle version before the next release. As far as I understand that would solve the issue, right?

See https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/issues/868

I think it should. As long as the solc-js dependency is >=0.4.20 it should be fine.

Indeed, we're now at solidity 0.4.21 since https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/pull/876. Next release is planned for the week of the 23rd.
