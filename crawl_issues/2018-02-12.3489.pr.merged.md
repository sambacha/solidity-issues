Done.

@maraoz @frangio @frozeman any idea why web3.js or zeppelin would ignore missing constructor parameters on Node 8 and succeed, while it would fail on Node 6?

Which version is it using ? 0.20.x?
It’s certainly a weird behavior, what exact error are you getting in node 6?

The version is even 0.16 I would suggest updating to at least 0.20
I think I had that error once but don’t remember why anymore. Can you test updating and we see if it fixes it

The strange thing is with Node 8 it doesn't complain (running it at upstream), but those methods indeed seem to be lacking those fields. We've fixed here with manually replacing those :)

Will report upstream and bug them to upgrade web3.js.

Ideally to 1.0.0-beta... it’s more reliable for that stuff
