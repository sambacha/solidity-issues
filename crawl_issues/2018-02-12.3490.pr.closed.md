Hm, build times are fast enough for us I think. What we are missing is a recent eth binary that does not depend on libmicrohttpd anymore so we can run the end to end tests.

@chfast this was your old branch on the repo. Can you please have a look to see if any of these changes still make sense?

Pulled out the lsb change (#3612). The two remaining useful changes from here are:
- sanitizer change
- using ninja in cireclci

@chfast @chriseth any of these are worth merging?

I don't think so. The sanitizer changes are in https://github.com/ethereum/cable, so you may consider integrating this when stable enough.

Ninja speeds up builds, so you can enabled it in CIs. But you don't need this PR.

I think our build is already fast enough on circle. We need to speed up the testing :)

I'm not pushing Ninja.
BTW, Ninja also has higher requirements for correct describe dependencies, so you might find some issues in CMake scripts.
