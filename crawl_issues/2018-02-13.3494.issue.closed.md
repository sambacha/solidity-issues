That's a tricky one. Of course `this.f.selector` should be fine, and even `this.f` should be fine. The problem is that `this` is disallowed in a view context - reading the current address is not a pure action.

Thank you.

At a minimum, can we a get a "this should be fixed someday" on this issue.

I am more interested in this issue being accepted and less interested in the actual fix. I think you know why...
