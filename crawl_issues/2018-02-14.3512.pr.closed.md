"Labeling the visibility explicitly will make it easier to catch incorrect assumptions about who can call the function or access the variable." â€“ https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/recommendations/#explicitly-mark-visibility-in-functions-and-state-variables

I closed this pull request then reopened after re-forking and removing the "Explicitly label visibility" commit because I wanted to ensure the single responsibility principle was followed in my pull request, as I originally intended.  I will add the "Explicitly label visibility" commit in a separate pull request in the future
Here is the new [pull request](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3513)
Thank you!
