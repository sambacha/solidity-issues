Recommend consistent style for wrapping long lines.

The style guide already has a section about breaking long lines at least for function declaration:

@chriseth 

I know, I meticulously follow the style guide; but, I've seen inconsistency from developers (individually and as a group) when it comes to long lines that are not covered yet (function calls, assignment statements, event definitions/event emitters, and output parameters/return statements).  
I have come across these many times "in the wild", and it is often these sections of code that slow me down while parsing; this is why I found it necessary to amend the Style Guide.

I also realized that the style recommended in PEP 8 does not seem to translate well over to Solidity for readability because long function declarations in Solidity drop every parameter and modifier onto its own line, so the code flows much differently than Python.  

I believe this style promotes "Solid" Code (Solid being our version of Pythonic).

I certainly agree that the style guide needs such a section, I'm just saying that it is not consistent with the rest of the document, since it suggests putting the closing element on a line of its own.

@chriseth 

You are saying that the closing parenthesis and semi-colon should be on their own lines like the closing braces for structs/enums, and the closing parens for parameters? 

I agree, that's more Solid.

I think the following is more consistent with the current documentation.  
```      
thisFunctionCallIsReallyLong.(
    longArgument1, 
    longArgument2, 
    longArgument3
);
```
I'll go ahead and change the file and original PR comment accordingly.

Splendid!

@chriseth 

Also, now considering the following for long assignment statements
```
oracles[msg.sender].curves[specifier] = (
    FunctionsInterface.Curve(
        curveType,
        curveStart,
        curveMultiplier
    )
);
```
instead of 
```
oracles[msg.sender].curves[specifier] = FunctionsInterface.Curve(
    curveType,
    curveStart,
    curveMultiplier
);
```

I'm not sure we should force the use of an additional pair of parentheses here. In general, I usually tend to stay away from style issues, the community can handle that better.

The beginning of this PR seems to be rather uncontroversial, though, so if you keep the context limited, I can merge this.

@OTTTO please squash your commits and perhaps consider reducing the commit log (it currently has the big initial description from here).

@axic  I have squashed and reduced commit log as you recommended :) Thanks!
