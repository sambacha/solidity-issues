# [\#3522 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3522) `closed`: It should not be possible to initialize constant variables with expressions that divide by zero or use addmod/mulmod with zero.

@chriseth I found the following case which is not handled correctly:
```
contract c {
    uint constant a = mulmod(3, 4, 0);
    uint constant b = addmod(3, 4, 0);
    function f() public pure {

    }
}
```
Division by zero e.g. ``uint constant a = 1 / 0`` seems to be catched by ``binaryOperatorResult``. Do you have another example?

What about
```
contract c {
    uint constant a = 0;
    uint constant b = 7 / a;
}
```

If we cannot think of other cases, then only mulmod / addmod needs to be included.
