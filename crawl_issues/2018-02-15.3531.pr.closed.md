Fixes #3530

Echoing from the linked issue: I don't have personal experience so as to judge whether this solution is reasonable or somewhat of a hack.

I would rather avoid removing what looks like safety features. Could you please check if changing the line from
```
FunctionalInstruction const& instruction = boost::get<FunctionalInstruction const&>(_expr);
```
to
```
FunctionalInstruction const& instruction = boost::get<FunctionalInstruction>(_expr);
```
fixes it?

I also had this problem and confirm that applying that change (removing `const &`) to that and 3 other occurrences leads to compilation working again.
