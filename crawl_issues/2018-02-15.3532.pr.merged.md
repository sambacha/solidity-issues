- removed deprecated api to be compatible with newer versions of jsoncpp
- usage of strict-mode parsing
- added json-specific tests in test/libdevcore/JSON.cpp
- added unexpected_trailing_test to test/libsolidity/StandardCompiler.cpp

Most of the helpers were inline in `JSON.h` because they were tiny. The new version of the helpers seem to be a bit bigger, but more importantly they are used in more places than before. I think it makes sense moving the implementation out of the header.

I might be wrong about this, any opinions @chriseth @aarlt ?

It's definitely on the edge to get moved out of the header. I would like to move it.

@axic @chriseth Why is there that error? Is that related to my changes?
```
     Error: Could not connect to your Ethereum client. Please check that your Ethereum client:
    - is running
    - is accepting RPC connections (i.e., "--rpc" option is used in geth)
    - is accessible over the network
    - is properly configured in your Truffle configuration file (truffle.js)
```

I'm running a small cleanup on the coding style and will force-push to your branch, so please do not overwrite later.

@aarlt the error is unrelated to your change.

@axic can be merged from my side.

From the strict mode documentation:

```
   /** \brief A configuration that is strictly compatible with the JSON
   * specification.
   * - Comments are forbidden.
   * - Root object must be either an array or an object value.
   * - Assumes Value strings are encoded in UTF-8
   */
  static Features strictMode();
```

Perhaps it makes sense adding two more tests: comments and invalid UTF-8 strings.

@axic I already included a test to check the comments and I was really surprised that they where allowed. Now I just took a look to the `jsoncpp` code - I really don't know why they write here `Comments are forbidden.` - if `allowComments_` is `false`, they just skip `CommentTokens`.
```cpp
void Reader::skipCommentTokens(Token& token) {
  if (features_.allowComments_) {
    do {
      readToken(token);
    } while (token.type_ == tokenComment);
  } else {
    readToken(token);
  }
}
```
It looks like that they just disable the collection of comments in there AST. So there will be no error generated. Probably `allowComments` is just a translation error or something like that, it should be `ignoreComments`.

Regarding `Assumes Value strings are encoded in UTF-8 ` I think it just means that it assumes that the values are UTF-8 encoded, there is also no real check regarding that. The only thing I saw in the code was a check regarding UTF-8 escape sequences - but that is of course also done with non-strict parsing.

@chriseth Wow, I didn't knew that a force-push to my branch is possible. Good to know.

We should submit a patch for "super strict", pedantic or "canonical json" mode :)

Ok - I assumed the parser would fail on an invalid UTF-8 sequence. I'll add such a test case anyway so we'll trigger a failure once/if they implement it.
