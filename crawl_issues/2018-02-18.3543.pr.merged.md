# [\#3543 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3543) `merged`: Add gas forwarding details to address related functions in documentation

For `transfer`, `send`, `call`, `callcode`, `delegatecall`, it's useful to know not only whether it returns `false` or throws on failure but also how much gas it forwards.

Thanks for the change! While I think it is useful, it is actually a little more complicated :)

`forwards all gas` is only the default, you can change it with the `.gas` member.

@chriseth How about instead of "forwards all available gas" it says "forwards all available gas by default, can be adjusted with ``gas()``. As I know it's only possible for `call`, `callcode`, `delegatecall` but not `transfer`, `send`?

Yes, sounds good! Perhaps it would be better to not repeat the "can be adjusted..." part for each item in the list but just say something like (adjustable / not adjustable).

@chriseth done :)
