highestBidder is the address.
it's highestBid that should be != 0 to be considered as pending return.

It's that right?

Hm, does that make a difference? If you think it can be better understood this way, then we should change it.

No it doesn't I just think is more readable. I rather would use address(0x0) to be explicit if I'm comparing an address. That's why when I saw the number I thought it was referring to the bid.

But, again, not much difference anyway. Maybe would be less confusing for beginners like me?

The change to require proper address literals will also fix this :)
