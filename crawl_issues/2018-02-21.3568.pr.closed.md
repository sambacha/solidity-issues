The addition of a wholesale "brew update" command which causes brew to update packages that do not depend or used by solidity is a bad system practice. It causes breakage in the target system libraries which should not occur. Please limit the install_deps script to updates of the brew repos only needed for solidity and noting else.

Please open an issue to discuss and not a pull request.
