# [\#3572 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3572) `closed`: Add parameter-less `push()` method to dynamic storage arrays (S)
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

This method just adds a zero-initialized element to the end of the array and returns a storage reference to it.

- [ ] explain the differentce of `x.push() = 7` and `uint y = x.push(); y = 7;` for `x` being a `uint` storage array in the documentation

`pushEmpty()` for the sake of explicitness?

We should discuss that, it might be that `push()` is easier to understand than `pushEmpty()`

Is there any demand for this variant?

Keyword additions should be considered critically, lest the dictionary run out of words for us to use.

@fulldecent this does not add a keyword, it just adds a method to a predefined type. And yes, there is a demand for this, because in some cases, especially if you have an array of a complicated struct, it is hard to add a new element to an array if you cannot do `.length++` anymore.

Bare `push()` is ambiguous: it is unclear whether the value is default-initialized (e.g. with zeros) or not initialized at all (i.e. contains random stuff).

I think it is better to add default-initialization syntax for complex structs like in C++ and other languages. The syntax for initialization could be `ComplexStruct cs = ComplexStruct()`, and for pushing an empty element — `.push(ComplexStruct())`.

@kkirka there is no possibility that anything contains random stuff in Solidity, everything is always zero-initialized.

While `.push(ComplexStruct())` might be a possibility, it is much more work for the optimizer to improve the gas costs of such a construct (the struct is initialized in memory and then copied to storage).

I'm still torn between just adding `push()` and adding `pushEmpty()` or perhaps `pushNew()`. Are there any more opinitions?

`expand()` `increase(n)` ?

This function could either return the new length or a storage reference to the newly created element. The latter could be a little confusing for value types, though, since the two following snippets would have different behaviour:

`x.pushEmpty() = 2;` and  `uint b = x.pushEmpty(); b = 2;`

`expand` could be a good name, since we do not actually push anything.

I vote for `.push()`. It is very clear what this does and it does not introduce new words into the language.

Not everybody speaks English. And those people need to learn EVERY word related to Solidity.

I had to deal with this problem working on ERC-721. "Title" was a great word for the concept we were creating. But this was very confusing to many people, especially ESL, so we chose "deed" (in addition to NFT).

Some languages use `grow()`.

Can you please write down an example piece of code how this will be used?

I am not sure if this returns a storage reference or not? Otherwise will the user need to read `.length` and then retrieve a reference?

Discussion resulted: inclining to just use `push()`. Need to come up with specific use-cases and decide whether it should return a reference to the new element, the new length or nothing.

```
contract C {
  struct S { ... };
  S users[];

  // Returning a reference.
  // I think in this case allocate / pushEmpty / reserve could make sense (calling for other names :)
  function f() {
    S storage user = users.allocate();
  }

  // Just increasing the array.
  // I think in this case pushEmpty, expand, grow make sense
  function g() {

What about `users.new()`? or `users.pushNew()`? (which would then return the reference)

Actually, I think returning the reference is really important, because juggling around with the length is rather combersome and might lead to errors.

`new` sounds like a good option too.

Another one: would `S storage = users.next()` make sense? Probably sounds like an iterator.

Can we agree that we're going with the option of returning a reference and naming that appropriately?

new is actually not possible, since it is a keyword.

```expand(n)``` or ```grow(n)``` makes sense, as there may be instances where a developer wants to add the default value and decides to use ```push()``` instead of ```push(0)```;  in this case, the exact intentions may be confusing to someone reading the code, which is why a separate method name sounds appropriate.

Discussion: let's just start implementing this returning a reference and we can change the name later. Also we should check whether this is a breaking change for contracts that use `using x for y`.

Example:
```
a.push().bla = 2;
StructName storage x = a.push();
x.bla = 2;
x.foo = 7;
```

would `.pushNew()` increase clarity?

Looking at the examples I think `pushEmpty` sounds the most natural.

empty makes sense for an array of arrays, but an array of uints? The problem is that we use the term "default value" or "zero value" a lot in the documentation but have not really defined or fixed it.

I think we should just use plain ``push()`` - I don't think that more explicitness has all that much real benefit here and it may even be confusing in the end - if you disagree I would probably prefer something like ``a.newElement()`` over ``pushNew`` (and ``pushEmpty`` indeed doesn't work in all cases).

I'm also in favor of ``push()``. Maybe we could think about returning ``(ref, new_length)``?

@bit-shift Returning ``(ref, new_length)`` would make it difficult to use the returned reference without assigning everything to variables (think ``ìnitializeSomething(listOfSomethings.push())``), so I'm in favor of just returning ``ref`` (having to use the ``length`` member of the array, if one needs the length seems fine with me).

Decision by show of hands: let's call it `push()` and it returns a reference to the newly created array element.
