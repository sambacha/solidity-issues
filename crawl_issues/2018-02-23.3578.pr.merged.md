Talked with Chris and Matt, in order to develop stronger ethereum community in China, we decided to initiate the activity to translate Solidity documentation into Simplified Chinese version. We have invited over 10 experienced translators as a team to contribute on this effort.

What you did:
I finished translation of index.rst into Simplified Chinese and wanted it to be added into main doc index.

That's wonderful!

Could you please add "in progress" until it is fully translated?

Hey @hongbinzuo thanks for your amazing contribution! I'm trying to get translations more coordinated, and we've had a few people interested in simplified Chinese and Mandarin. As we move toward a new documentation release soon, are you still interested in helping us translate that release into simplified Chinese too?
