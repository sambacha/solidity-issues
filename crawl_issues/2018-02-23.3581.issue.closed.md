# [\#3581 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3581) `closed`: Split circle into build and test, use parallelism

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-02-23 09:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3581):

The x86 build on circle should be split into build and test.
The test run should use parallelism for the four combinations of VM and optimiser.

Documentation: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/parallelism-faster-jobs/

We still need to check whether these parallel runs are actually done in the same container or not. If they are done in the same container, the solution will not work, because we would have to run two instances of `eth` which is rather problematic.
