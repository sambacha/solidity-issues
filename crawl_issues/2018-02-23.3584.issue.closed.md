... and move the CompilerStack into a member variable.

@chriseth I'd like to try and help with this. Can you provide any more details so I can get a better idea of what's needed?

Sure! There are many test files (e.g. Metadata.cpp, Imports.cpp) that create an instance of CompilerStack per test (not test file) and adjust certain settings on it. This can be moved into a test fixture as it is done in AnalysisFramework.h and others. The best solution would probably be to even move out the CompilerStack member from AnalysisFramework.h (and other fixtures) into a general base class that contains all functionality common to the frameworks.

Does that explain it?

I think so. I'll give it a shot and see what I can do. I'll start a PR early and may ask for feedback while it is still in progress.

I ended up having a few things come up, but I do plan on working on this Sunday. I'll get a PR open ASAP and we'll go from there. Thank you for checking in on it!

@chriseth I'm going through a quick c++ primer now and will have something for you to look at tonight.

@chriseth I'm getting back to this.

@chriseth 
I'm getting an error in the test run (reverted my changes and rebased with latest develop branch)

```

Do you have any suggestions on getting the tests to run?

@ksolo this is an unrelated problem that only occurs on certain macos versions. The proposed fix is here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3999

Perhaps it is better to ignore that problem for now.

@chriseth do we really need this? There doesn't seem to be too many tests using it.

I still think this would be beneficial.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
