@chriseth this is work in progress, need to clean up the commits, but it produces the exact same output as before

@chriseth added tests but unescaping doesn't work.

How about removing the unescaping part for now and merging the code which is just a refactoring, then separately unescaping and perhaps changing the escape codes so it can be properly unescaped?

Would be good to have unescaping working to see that it actually is a bijection. Let me do the review, then I can tell.

This simple way (since it is just replacements one after the other) of unescaping will break when underscores are next to escaped `$`:

input: `_$_`
escaped: `_$$$_`
unescaped: `_$_` -> `,`

It could be done properly by doing unescaping in one go.

ok, I'm fine with merging without unescaping.
