# [\#3591 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3591) `closed`: contract invocation: raw call with string param won't be passed

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17768831?v=4" width="50">[mirgj](https://github.com/mirgj) opened issue at [2018-02-24 18:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3591):

I'm trying to invoke another contract in solidity using raw calls but I'm encountering some problems.
```solidity
instance.call.gas(gas).value(price)(bytes4(keccak256("method(string)")), param);
```
this instruction is inside my second contract and while I try to get the value of the `param` from my first contract method its empty but instead its value is passed into `msg.data`.

I added an event on my first contract to see how the parameters has been sent.

```solidity
function method(string param) payable external {
 Debug(param, msg.sender, msg.value, msg.data);
}
```
basically `param` is always empty while the data inside `msg` are always sent. In `msg.data` there is the parameter value (in bytes).

Using this other kind of invocation will work well

```solidity
instance.method.gas(gas).value(price)(param);
```
but it won't help me much because in this case will throw an exception that I couldn't handle in the caller block (that's why I'm going for the raw call) 

I'm using **solc@0.4.19**

Coming from stackoverflow and experiencing the same issue here.

Can you link the stackoverflow question, please? You should use `instance.call` only in extremely rare circumstances. This is a very dangerous way to call another contract.

Ah sorry, the reason is explained at the end of the issue. Can you please post complete smart contract code so we can try to reproduce the issue?

It looks like you do not perform abi encoding properly. We will soon support `abi.encode` that could help you there, until then, you have to do it manually.

@chriseth Hi Chris here's the link - https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/40769/solidity-contract-invocation-raw-call-with-string-param-wont-be-passed, basically the same.

My question is: What if I don't know the contract type of instance (it's just an address), but I do know that it has a function of signature say func(string)? Then I could only use instance.call(bytes4(keccak256("func(string)")), raw_str)....

```
interface StringFuncContract {
  function func(string);
}
contract MyContract {
  function myFunction(address _a) {
    StringFuncContract(_a).func("abc");
  }
}
```

Or even better:
```
contract MyContract {
  function myFunction(StringFuncContract _a) {
    _a.func("abc");
  }
}
```

Ah it's an awesome trick! Thank you Chris!  A bit curious since I'm not able to find any detail about it from solidity documentation: how does _a find func's code to invoke, as StringFuncContract.func has no implementation? They just share the same function signature

@chriseth I've deployed test contracts to demonstrate the issue:

TestCallWithString.sol - has a function "callback(string)" to be invoked by other contract and the string argument passed in is stored as result:
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x78134e6ab7d952692ef9f35751f64d925609475d

Call.sol - calls TestCallWithString.callback using call:
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0xa058a62979b12aa6fba8852a1447699dd0ec267f

The passed string is lost if using call:
From this tx: https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x6f0932bf5302b0d107e5fede1af225e3375c38186eb511c628fb61b593a57a42;
and its event logs:

Also from TestCallWithString's state: timestamp is set correctly but result is empty:

So raw call with string param is indeed not passed.

@jonnyhsy if you use a raw call, you have to properly encode the string argument. I explained it on the stackexchange question.
