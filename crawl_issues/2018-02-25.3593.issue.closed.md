As recommended by official docs (http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html) I tried to install latest stable version of Solidity compiler on Ubuntu via the following commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install solc

Installation was successful but installed version appeared to be 0.4.19 while I expected it to be 0.4.20 because this is latest stable release according to this page: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases

This was clean install, not an upgrade, i.e. Solidity compiler was not installed on this machine ever before.

Here is operation system version I use:

    Linux <snip> 4.4.0-112-generic #135-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 19 11:48:36 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Before trying to install on Ubuntu, I successfully upgraded Solidity to 0.4.20 on MacOS via `brew`.

Which Ubuntu version are you running?

@chriseth wouldn't it make sense removing the package (or adding some other kind of notification) on outdated distributions?

    $ lsb_release -a
    No LSB modules are available.
    Distributor ID: Ubuntu
    Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
    Release:        16.04
    Codename:       xenial

But initially I encountered this problem when I tried to assemble docker image with Solidity compiler inside based on official Ubunty "latest" image.  Same result: 0.4.19 was installed instead of 0.4.20.

It turns out we had a build failure on xenial which we didn't notice. The build problem has been fixed in the meantime, but I'm not sure we should spend time backporting the fix and re-publishing. Our release process also does not really know such a procedure. I'd rather try to release 0.4.21 this week.

Build for 0.4.21 was successful, please reopen if it still does not work.
