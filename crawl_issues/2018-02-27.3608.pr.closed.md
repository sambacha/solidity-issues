# [\#3608 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3608) `closed`: Update Delegatecall Description in Docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11155959?u=c167de6b2697c68361b2940b1385c5dcdc8e9886&v=4" width="50">[RobbieFerguson](https://github.com/RobbieFerguson) opened issue at [2018-02-27 05:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3608):

The previous description did not include the fact that the storage locations of the two contracts must align up until the storage variable(s) affected in order for the called contract to successfully write to the caller's storage. If they are misaligned, delegatecall will silently fail. This is difficult to debug without underlying knowledge of how delegatecall works, and clarity in the docs would certainly be helpful.

Thank you for your pull request! While it is good to add this information at some point, I'm not sure this is the right place. This section is concerned with the low-level EVM details, and things like "storage locations of variables" are alien to the EVM. Furthermore, this might suggest that you have to take care about matching storage locations when using libraries, which is not the case.

Perhaps the description of the low-level `delegatecall` function would be a better place to put this.

Thanks @chriseth. Moving it to a (hopefully) appropriate location.
