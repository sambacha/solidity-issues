# [\#3609 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3609) `merged`: Update Delegatecall Description in Docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11155959?u=c167de6b2697c68361b2940b1385c5dcdc8e9886&v=4" width="50">[RobbieFerguson](https://github.com/RobbieFerguson) opened issue at [2018-02-27 10:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3609):

The previous description did not include the fact that the storage locations of the two contracts must align up until the storage variable(s) affected in order for the called contract to successfully write to the caller's storage. If they are misaligned, delegatecall will silently fail. This is difficult to debug without underlying knowledge of how delegatecall works, and clarity in the docs would certainly be helpful.
