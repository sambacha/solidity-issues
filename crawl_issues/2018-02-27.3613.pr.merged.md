Test output isn't really clear:

```
--> Running tests without optimizer...
Commandline tests successful.

*** 3 failures are detected in the test module "SolidityTests"
Exited with code 201
```

@axic yes, the reporting for commandline tests could be better. Perhaps we could use a suite that provides proper xml logging. The errors for the other tests are very nicely reported in https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/2834?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link
