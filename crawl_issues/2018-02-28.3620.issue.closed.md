@AnthonyBroadCrawford the best place is to join https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev and discuss questions there.

@AnthonyBroadCrawford please go ahead! Github does not let us formally assign this to you, though, but it is reserved for you :)

@chriseth awesome, digging in today/tonight.  Thank you!

Thanks both of you.

The message is generate in SourceReferenceFormatter.cpp:83. It is triggered for example if you have a file that does not have a pragma for the compiler version. Then the generated warning applies to the whole file (and thus "spanning multiple lines").

@chriseth I've made the change to have it appear on the same line as the ^ and am wondering if I should wrap this change in a unit test within the tests folder?  Is that something that would typically be tested in the project?

@chriseth I opened up a pull request to gain feedback on the code.  I followed the guidelines to do so.  Let me know if you have any questions.
