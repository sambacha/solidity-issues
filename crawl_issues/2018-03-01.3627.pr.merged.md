If you add `Closes #2182` to the description of the pull request, that issue will be automatically closed and also linked to this pull request.

Please also add a line to `Changelog.txt` describing the change. It is probably a good idea for this PR to not add it to the changelog of 0.4.21 but instead start a new version 0.5.0. We will then merge it when 0.5.0 will be the next release.

Looks good! I'm not adding a positive review on purpose, so we do not accidentally merge this PR.

Please rebase since #3633 was merged.

We should also add `copy` and `copyof`.

Please do that and do not include it in the commit messages.

I removed the ``constructor`` keyword from this PR, since it breaks the tests unless the parser is updated, so it makes more sense to only add it in #4106.

Do we really want to reserve all of them? Perhaps we should rather make breaking changes more often...

@chriseth I find the list of new keywords (and especially ``copy``) to be a bit excessive myself and it seems to me more frequent breaking releases make more sense.
The question is whether there is a subset of this list that should definitely be in 0.5.0.

100%: constructor and emit
80%: mutable, immutable, unchecked, override
60%: alias, typedef

@axic We still need to decide whether we want to keep this PR at all or which subset to keep.
``constructor`` and ``emit`` are handled in separate commits, but we need to decide which of the other ones should in fact be reserved in 0.5.0 already.

I think we should just merge this. The only debatable one I think is `topic` and perhaps `fallback` because we don't know yet if we'll have `wildcard` or `fallback`, etc.

@axic I think what started the discussion actually was whether to keep ``copy``, since it may be commonly used and break a lot of code. (@chriseth brought that up in an now outdated Changelog.md review comment)

Also if this is merged first and `constructor`/`emit` later then those are just moved from the reserved list to the "new keywords" line.

It seems `copy` is used in stringutils so that might be something we need to consider. Nothing else seems to break.

I'd take a shortcut and merge the non-contentious ones here and open a new PR for the rest.

Removed ``copy``, ``topic`` and ``fallback`` from the list.
I would still not include ``constructor`` and ``emit`` here, since the workarounds will fail once the keywords are introduced, so I think it's best to handle them separately altogether.

Removed ``const`` as well.
