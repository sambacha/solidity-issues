# [\#3632 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3632) `merged`: clarify 2300 gas stipend in fallback function section

The fallback function documentation on gas stipend is confusing. It didn't mention anything about EOA or CA and is giving people the impression that it cannot use more than 2300 gas.

Thank you for your pull request! I agree that it should be toned down, but I would not remove the examples. People are usually very confused about what requires how much gas.

Your version also reads like `send` and `transfer` provide the stipend, while in fact it is a feature of the EVM itself. We could write something like "in the worst case, the fallback function can only rely on 2300 gas being available (for example when `send` or `transfer` is used)."

hi chriseth, yeah its actually the evm doing the stipend, thanks for point out my language. Feel free to tweak it further. The current version is sounding like you can't have anything inside the fallback function which is incorrect. So many people were confused by it.
