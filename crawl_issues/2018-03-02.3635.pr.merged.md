# [\#3635 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3635) `merged`: Constructors are defined using the ``constructor`` keyword.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2018-03-02 13:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3635):

Closes #3196.

These changes do not contain adjustments of unit test that are using the old constructors. Should we change them once 0.5.0 has been released or earlier?

This should update at least the documentation. Updates to test cases might be delayed as long as they still work.

Can you guys please squash some commits (eg those which logically are related)? :)

@axic Regarding not changing the contracts in std/: It seems that without changing them the
ci/circleci: test_x86 tests fail - that's why we changed them in the first place. I now reverted the changes in std/ and consequently the CI test error reappears... not sure what's the best solution here.

Does it make sense to refer to the files in std without a tag name? Even if we change the version pragma, the effect will be the same: It won't be compilable.

axic's point that these files can be used by contracts referring to the github repo is probably an argument against dropping the version pragma altogether...

I see various options, but none of them are particularly good:
- Remove the version pragma and use the new syntax, resulting in probably rather incomprehensible errors if the files are included by contracts using older compiler versions and referring to the files in the repo.
- The same goes for keeping the current version pragma and using the new syntax, but it would probably be even more misleading.
- Bump the version pragma in the files to 0.4.21 already and use the new syntax, resulting in test failures (due to errors in std/).
- Keep the current version pragmas and use the old syntax, resulting in test failures (due to warnings in std/) (this is the current state).

Until #3662 is decided I changed std/owned.sol and std/StandardToken.sol to the new syntax based on the fact that emit is used in StandardToken.sol as well.

I also removed the version pragmas in those two files, since they would be even more misleading.

Changed the version pragmas in std/ to 0.4.20 with comment that it should actually be 0.4.21 as suggested by @axic and as done in the documentation.

Please do not leave stray comments like "WIP: Tests are not adjusted yet." in the commits.
