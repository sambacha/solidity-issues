# [\#3638 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3638) `closed`: Yul optimizer fuzz tester

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-03-02 15:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3638):

## Abstract

The YUL optimizer needs to be fuzz tested. This issue specifically tracks writing the fuzzing test harness itself. A related issue #3639 tracks generation of yul code for fuzz testing.

The envisioned steps for fuzzing the YUL optimizer are as follows:
1. generate yul code (see #3639) and feed it to the optimizer
2. obtain execution traces (effect of yul code on the environment) of the input yul code as well as its optimized version (the yul interpreter may be used to obtain a trace of a yul program, see #3464 )
3. Assert equality of execution traces

```
yul_in_trace = traceYul(yul_in);
yul_out_trace = traceYul(yul_out);
assert(yul_in_trace == yul_out_trace);
```

where `yul_in` and `yul_out`  are the (fuzzed) input yul code and the optimized yul code.
