# [\#3640 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3640) `merged`: moved spanning multi lines message to appear on some lane vs new lineâ€¦

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21401?v=4" width="50">[AnthonyBroadCrawford](https://github.com/AnthonyBroadCrawford) opened issue at [2018-03-03 14:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3640):

Fixes #3620.  I moved the message to be on the same line per the direction in the issue.  

I didn't add any tests for this, but open to that if we think that is needed.  

Let me know what feedback exists and what you would like to see changed. 

Cheers.

This should change from:
```
strings.sol:636:5: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    function rsplit(slice self, slice needle) internal returns (slice token) {
    ^
Spanning multiple lines.
```

to:
```
strings.sol:636:5: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    function rsplit(slice self, slice needle) internal returns (slice token) {
    ^ Spanning multiple lines.
```

I'd perhaps go one step further and clarify the text somewhat, like "Source spanning multiple lines" or "Referenced source spanning multiple times" ?

    function rsplit(slice self, slice needle) internal returns (slice token) {
    ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
