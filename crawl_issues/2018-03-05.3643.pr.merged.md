* Am I right in assuming that due to scoping introducing the gasleft as a new global in fact does not break existing code?

* I wasn't sure what kind of tests to add, so I added several tests - not all of them may be necessary. Also: the tests share the same name - is that ok, since they test the same feature or should they still have distinct names?

Re-triggered test, seems to be infrastructure issue.

@ekpyron @chriseth we have never discussed this issue, whether it should be a function or a "volatile" variable.

Also should raise a warning if using `msg.gas`.

@axic created an issue for the warning, but the description of your issue was rather clear that it should be a function. We discussed this and concluded that indeed, it should be a function. Note that both `address.balance` and `now` are at least static between external calls.

The issue had both options, but I don't remember any discussion.

I had no preference, I like the function better as having volatile variables isn't a good idea at the moment.
