# [\#3647 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3647) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Support to Bool variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2018-03-05 18:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3647):

This PR adds support to Bool program variables including two types of tests: only Bool and mixed Bool/Integer tests.

Did you test all bool operators?
 - comparison (less than, ...)
 - equality / inequality
 - negation

More or less related: Did we implement short-circuiting correctly?

Negation, equality and inequality yes.

What is the behavior for LT, LE, GT and GE? I couldn't find it in the docs.

Where exactly? The encoding has the same structure as the original expression, so I would say yes.

`false < true`.

short circuiting: is `if (x || f())` evaluating `f()` in case `x` is true? It should not, i.e. be roughly equivalent to

```
bool result = false;
if (x) { result = true; }
else if (f()) { result = true; }
```

I don't think we can properly test this at this stage, though.

Perhaps `bool x = false; if (true || (x = true)) {}; assert(!x);` could work.

I see your point, but I'm not sure this would make any difference for the solver.
This code
```
bool result = false;
if (x) { result = true; }
else if (f()) { result = true; }
```
says that `x -> result` and `f() -> result`. The solver may still just set both as true.

- Implemented comparison (gt, ge, lt, le) and tests.
- Replaced `Declaration` pointer by reference in `SSAVariable` and `Symbolic*Variable`.
- Applied the suggested restructure for `SolverInterface`.

There are test failures. Re-running to see if they were infrastructure problems.
