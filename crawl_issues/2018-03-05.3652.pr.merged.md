…ving it in MagicType.

Closes #3650.

In #3643 ``msg.gas`` was deprecated by conditionally removing it from the MagicType in Types.cpp, resulting in an error for experimental v0.5.0, but no warning was issued when using ``msg.gas`` pre-v0.5.0.

The only way to add such a warning I found is in the StaticAnalyzer (I realized this possibility only now - before I had not seen a good place to issue such a warning at all).

Comparing the case of ``msg.gas`` with, for instance, the deprecation of ``callcode`` in favour of ``delegatecall``, I now realize that the static analyzer may have been the better choice for deprecating ``msg.gas`` from the beginning. Therefore this pull request proposes to revert parts of the changes of #3643 and instead keeps ``msg.gas`` in MagicType, but issues a warning, resp. raises an error in the static analyzer.

I think this solution is more consistent with existing code than the original solution in #3643.

Alternatively, the changes of #3634 could be left untouched, and this pull request could be reduced to issuing the warning in the static analyzer only.
