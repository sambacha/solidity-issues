The previous URL pointed to a location that was deprecated and stated the following ```The Remix IDE has moved to http://remix.ethereum.org. This instance of Remix you are visiting WILL NOT BE UPDATED. Please make a backup of your contracts and start using http://remix.ethereum.org```

I think there are several links in the documentation to Remix. Can you please double check that none of them use the old URL?

There is another one in docs/installing-solidity.rst, it should point to https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/tree/gh-pages
