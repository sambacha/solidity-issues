I think this is superseded by a PR waiting for your review for quite a while now: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3308/files#diff-ee617ea709ab57f19fa067e365a9b4f8R1860

I know I've seen that was my trigger to push this. Will see if it can/need to be reconciled.

The other version has a length check, so I think that is superior.

@chriseth I merged the cleanup one from the other PR here so the documentation is kept. Can you double check it is valid?

Also this one uses it in one more place (in `appendExternalCall`) compared to the other one.

I'm pretty sure this is redundant now. If not, please reopen and rebase.
