# [\#3674 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3674) `closed`: [WIP] Infrastructure for extracting syntax tests.

Refs #3644.

Copies some example test contracts from SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp in separate files in test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/ in which the test expectations are encoded in comments, adds a parser for this encoding and populates the boost test tree with these tests.

The test report xml seems to contain binary data: https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/4376

The travis tests fail, since an older version of boost is used there, which exposes a different API for manual test registration. Not sure whether there's a really nice way to work around that, but I'm still looking.

Ah shoot! We still need to support trusty until mid 2019, so the only option would be to install boost manually via cmake (as cpp-ethereum already does), but that could create problems especially with the emscripten build. Is it possible to make it work in both versions? I somehow have the feeling that the old version did not support multi-level trees.

Well, if it doesn't have to be nice, then it won't be too much of a problem to support older versions of boost as well - but I think we might not get around ugly #if's distinguishing between boost versions...
I'm still checking whether there's a way around that, but if not, then at least that should definitely work
(I'm pretty sure that multi-level trees are supported already and only the API has changed).

What's actually the current version of boost used for those builds (resp. the minimal version we have to support)?

ubuntu trusty uses 1.54, that is probably he oldest we have to support.

Not sure why the travis test fails:

Rebased and squashed.

Added a first version of an interactive syntax test tool.
The code still has to be revised, but the functionality is there already.

Now includes a syntaxTestTool that can run all syntax tests interactively and allows to either edit test contracts and test expectation or to automatically update the test expectations to the actual results of the test in case of a test failure.

Please split this pull request into three different pull requests:

 - boost test runner
 - cmake modifications
 - expectation updater

Please update the documentation ("how to run the tests").
