# [\#3689 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3689) `closed`: Confusing examples of types used for binary operators
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

After operations the compiler implicitly performs type conversions which could lead to information lost.

If I sum two uint8 variables the result will be implicitly converted to uint8 despite the required result type.

Take a look at the [following contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x6034913e5aed454efddcdefc82ed8148e75ba2c3):

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract lim {
    function add1(uint8 a, uint8 b) public pure returns (uint ret) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    function add2(uint8 a, uint8 b) public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint c = a + b;
        return c;
    }
    
    function add3(uint8 a, uint8 b) public pure returns (uint ret) {
        if (300 < a + b) return 1000;
        uint c = 300;
        if (c < a + b) return 2000;
        return a + b;
    }
  
    function exp1(uint8 a, uint8 b) public pure returns (uint ret) {
        return a ** b;
    }
}
```

Try to execute exp1(10, 3) or addN(200, 200). 

Result will be "wrong" since after ADD and EXP instructions there are AND instructions: "ADD **PUSH1 0xFF AND**", "EXP **PUSH1 0xFF AND**". So the real result is always implicitly converted to narrower type without any warning. 

I think that such conversions are not obvious and could lead to errors. Unfortunately the [documentation](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#implicit-conversions) also could lead to misunderstanding: "If an operator is applied to different types, the compiler tries to implicitly convert one of the operands to the type of the other (the same is true for assignments). **In general, an implicit conversion between value-types is possible if it makes sense semantically and no information is lost**".

The documentation could be more specific by changing it to:


If an operator is applied to different types, the compiler tries to implicitly convert one of the operands to the type of the other (the same is true for assignments). **This means that operations are always performed in the type of one of the operands.** In general, an implicit conversion between value-types is possible if it makes sense semantically and no information is lost".

Would that help?

Note that the paragraph says "an implicit conversion is possible" and not "is performed".

As I understand a bottom up approach is used now for types determination. The ideal solution could be the opposite one - taking the result type and convert all the expression to it. 

Documentation changes could help a little. But I am afraid that most smart contract developers will never notice this compiler behaviour before they run into the problem.

Here is [another contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x9c4b763433354add099039c3b9454dac58a6fac5#readContract) example where associative property is broken for addition.
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;

contract lim {
    function add4() public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint8 a = 100;
        uint8 b = 200;
        uint16 c = 300;
        return a + b + c;
    }
    
    function add5() public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint8 a = 100;
        uint8 b = 200;
        uint16 c = 300;
        return a + c + b;
    }
    
    function add6() public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint8 a = 100;
        uint8 b = 200;
        return 300 + a + b;
    }
    
    function add7() public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint8 a = 100;
        uint8 b = 200;
        return a + b + 300;
    }
    
    function exp2() public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint8 b = 3;
        return 10 ** b;
  
    }
    
    function exp3() public pure returns (uint ret) {
        uint8 a = 10;
        uint8 b = 3;
        return a ** b;
    }
}
```

While function exp2 and exp3 are similar there is a warning only for the first one:

> Warning: Result of exponentiation has type uint8 and thus might overflow. Silence this warning by converting the literal to the expected type.

Indeed, the current approach is that the type of an expression or the resulting type of an operation can be determined by looking at the types of the operands only.

In practice, though, I would say that people do not often use arithmetic types that are not 256 bits wide.
