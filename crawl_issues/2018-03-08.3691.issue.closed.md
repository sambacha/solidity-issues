# [\#3691 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3691) `closed`: Revisit how the optimizer handles MLOAD

The fact that the optimizer treats MLOAD as having side-effects (which it does, it might modify MSIZE) removes any possibility for optimizing routines that concern both storage and memory.

We should revisit how MLOAD is handled by the optimizer. Previously, it was allowed to remove MLOAD operations if they are not required. Currently, MLOAD is treated as an operation that even breaks the CSE analysis, i.e. it cannot optimize across code parts that are separated by an MLOAD, which is an extremely severe restriction.

If we want to keep MSIZE being handled correctly, we can either keep track of where memory is accessed and remove mload operations if memory is also touched at higher indices.

Actually I just noticed that `KECCAK256` is also not marked as having side effects.

An easy solution to this would be to check whether the code makes use of `MSIZE`. If yes, tread `MLOAD` and `KECCAK` as having side-effects, otherwise not.

There is one situation where `MSIZE` is used by Solidity: If a struct is created in memory, it is placed at `MSIZE` to be sure that the memory is zeroed out. It is probably much cheaper to explicitly write zeros to memory in all cases and not use msize and thus have the opportunity to optimize across mloads.
