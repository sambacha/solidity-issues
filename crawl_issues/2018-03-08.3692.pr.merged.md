According to the [changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b5e804b8caba0cc84514898323df91a025705177/Changelog.md), `suicide` was deprecated before 0.4.3 (after 0.2.0) and warning by 0.4.17.
This PR puts that in the official documentation.

Thanks for the pull request! Can you please squash your commits?

On the Merge button, is there a little drop-down with a "[Squash and merge](https://blog.github.com/2016-04-01-squash-your-commits/)" option?

The Travis-CI issue seems to be from an error connecting to the local Ethereum client in testing.

> 
> Error: Could not connect to your Ethereum client. Please check that your Ethereum client:
>     - is running
>     - is accepting RPC connections (i.e., "--rpc" option is used in geth)
>     - is accessible over the network
>     - is properly configured in your Truffle configuration file (truffle.js)

"Squash and merge" actually creates a single commit and not a merge commit. It is preferable to have a proper merge commit.

Is this actually displayed as a warning when using `suicide`? If not, it should be.

There's a test case [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/478ce4fc384a77ade82207f6082caa68808159ec/test/libsolidity/SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp#L8063) for the warning that should be shown [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ba8819542fa2e4f0079323e6fefd0ba6ee9ea916/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L1569).  

I don't have all the right config on this machine to do a proper local squash but might be able to get that done eventually.
