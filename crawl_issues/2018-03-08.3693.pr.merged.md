Fixes #3691 and #3688 

Thanks to @figs999 for noticing these problems with the optimizer!

TODO:

 - [x] tests
 - [x] ~~create multidimensional arrays more efficiently~~ (will do in separate PR)
 - [x] change `calldatacopy` to `codecopy` (add a test that checks that it also works in a constructor)

I feel the first commit has two entirely different features in one. The assembly part for CSE, which I have reviewed and is fine, and the codegen part, which I have yet to review.

I also changed it to use codecopy, but I forgot the test for the constructor.

If someone wants to give a shot at the test while I'm on holidays, it should be rather easy to add. It should basically be identical to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3693/files#diff-f74c268962c6bb1d43e7b36341b501d4R594 except that it is done in the constructor (and does not use return but rather assign to a state variable).

@axic this should now be finished.

Looks good but fails this test: type_conversions_cleanup - SolidityEndToEndTest

Rebased. The test error was just a connection error with cpp-ethereum:
```
ASSERTION FAILURE:
- file   : RPCSession.cpp
- line   : 162
- message: critical check !result.isNull() has failed
```
