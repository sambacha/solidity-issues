# [\#3694 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3694) `closed`: Error when non-existent file is encountered

# PR for issue #3037 
This PR is now development complete and ready for review. 

## Decisions 
When implementing this feature I took the following approach 

1. Error and exit compilation if a non-existent file is encountered 
2. Create a new flag --ignore-missing that will continue compilation rather than error out when a missing file is encountered

## Questions 
Given I'm still fairly new to the codebase & Solidity in general I have the following questions 

1. In the method where I discover a missing file *and* the user hasn't passed in the `--ignore-missing` option I leverage `exit(1)` as a means to escape.  Primarily, it was the easiest path vs having to pass a boolean up the stack to inspect and then return 1/false further up the stack. 

2.  Please jump on my copy.  I don't have a feel for the prose throughout the code base for error message/communications within the compiler.  Open to any/all feedback. 

## Sample commands 
Here's a simple way to test it when compiling this branch.  This is executed from the ***build*** directory with the attached simple contract located in the same ***build*** directory 

*NO ERROR: * `./solc/solc --bin --ignore-missing test.sol missing-file.sol`
*ERROR* `./solc/solc --bin test.sol missing-file.sol`

## Sample contract 
Again, my above commands assume this is located in the *build* director 

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

contract Test {

}
```

@chriseth I took your feedback and only error when a file is missing and command line flag to suppress is not provided.  Updated change log and squashed down to a single commit.  Let me know if you see anything else that needs changed.

Looking into the failing tests.

Please use rebase and not merges.

@AnthonyBroadCrawford this is still not properly rebased. Please tell us if we should do it for you.
