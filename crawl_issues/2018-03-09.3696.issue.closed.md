# Issue 
When invoking solc with the compute gas flag `solc --gas` and you don't specify a contract solc will permanently hang.

## Steps to recreate 

1. Invoke solc with the following command `solc --gas` and don't specify a file 

## Specs 

1. Mac OSX High Sierra 
2. On develop branch 

## Ideal solution 
We should throw an error message informing the user to provide a file

It's not hanging, it appears to be waiting for input from STDIN. If you type the following and then hit ^D, solc will proceed.
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;
contract Foo {}
```

@redsquirrel is that documented anywhere?  It may be worth putting a prompt when a file isn't passed along.

To me, it's just standard Unix behavior. Unless otherwise specified on the command line, a program will wait for STDIN. This allows for pipelining. For instance, type `ruby`, `cat`, or `wc` on the command line, and they will hang, waiting for input, and keep taking input until they receive an EOF character. Which means you can pipe streams into these programs, such as 
```
echo "pragma solidity ^0.4.20; contract Foo {}" | solc --bin
```

You can use `solc --bin -` to make it expect input on stdin explicitly, so we could actually remove this behaviour, but I don't know who relies on it.

I'd be for the explicit `-`, but perhaps limit this to the 0.5.0 release?

I agree.
