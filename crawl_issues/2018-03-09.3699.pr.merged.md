Fixes #3682

Since it's not possible to check for contract kind in ``SyntaxChecker``, I moved the visibility check to the ``StaticAnalyzer``. The reasoning behind leaving just the ``v0.5.0`` check there is that it is a real syntax error and should not be thrown in the StaticAnalyzer.

@axic Some concerns were raised: #3682. Also, for me it's hard to tell how many users would be affected by this change which makes it difficult to judge.

Yes, I think it is cleaner to merge this only with the breaking release.

@chriseth the static analyser has access to that bit if information, hence this PR passes the tests. Are you still on the opinion it is better not to merge it?

I've added the additional 0.5.0 test and splitted all tests related to function visibility of interfaces into seperate files, such that ``isoltest`` picks them up.

@bit-shift why did you rolled back to the original version? I thought we agreed to display the extra message in static analyzer?

@axic Oh, yes. At some point I wasn't sure anymore (tried different things in regards to default visibility) and wanted to ask again. Will revert then and handle it as an error in ``v0.5.0``? Just want to make sure to do it right.

I think we agreed that the code you had to move it to staticanalyzer was good, just needed to be extended with an extra line: "in interfaces it defaults to external".

@axic I've updated the warning.

Perhaps should mention in the changelog, but really want to merge this now.
