# [\#3704 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3704) `closed`: [WIP] CompilerStack Test Fixtures

**WIP** This is jus the beginning of this work. It is not intended to be merged at this time **WIP**

References Issue #3584 

Creating a SharedInstances class to manage pieces that can be re-configured in test runs. Tests will not need to create these instances per test.

_NOTE_ The [coding standards link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/develop/CodingStandards.txt) gave me a 404. I will likely need to update these files to conform to those.

@chriseth I'm just getting started but is the shared instances ok, or would you prefer this be restricted to just CompilerStack at this time?

Thanks for the pull request! I need a little more code to be able to review this. You should not return CompilerStack by value for one. Please take a look at how it is done in AnalysisFramework and just extract some of the common functionalities into another class.

@ksolo do you intend to work more on this? If not, I would like to close this.

@chriseth Yes, I'd like to get back to this. I'm sorry I let this so for so long.
