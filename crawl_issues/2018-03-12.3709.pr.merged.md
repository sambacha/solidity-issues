# [\#3709 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3709) `merged`: Interactive syntax test tool.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-03-12 13:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3709):

Refs #3644.

Adds an interactive test tool that runs all syntax tests and for failing tests allows to interactively edit the test or replace the test expectations with the actual test results.

Part of #3674.

Depends on #3707 and #3708.

@chriseth I think this should be ready for another review now.

I noticed that non-bold cyan and yellow are not too well readable on my screen. Furthermore, perhaps we should not overdo it with the colours. For example, reading a full contract printed in colour is a little cumbersome.

What about colouring the words `Contract`, `Expected result` and `Obtained result' instead? (and of course `OK` `ERROR`, etc)

I would still like to keep the colors for the results and expected results to distinguish optically between warnings and errors. I will change it to bold yellow and red and we can see whether that helps. The contract can be displayed in white, though, and instead the headings (Contract:, etc.) in maybe also bold cyan.

@ekpyron what about keeping the colours only for the error type and not the whole message?

@chriseth That might be a good compromise. I first squashed bold colours and cyan for headings, white for the contract into the old commits and then added a new commit that only colours the error type, not the message.

I actually preferred the old colour scheme, but I'm fine with this as well (the actual result will largely depend on the used terminal emulator).

@chriseth I see only now that you approved the changes before the last commit (which changes the bool arguments for SyntaxTest::printErrorList to an enum). I actually prefer bool arguments in this particular case, since I don't think these arguments make up a meaningful enum (although in general, I agree that functions with lots of bool arguments should be avoided). Also the enum itself would be misplaced outside the SyntaxTest class or directly inside the SyntaxTest class as old-style enum, so I used an enum class as bitfield, which in turn means having to overload its operators...

In any case I'm fine with merging with or without this last change.

Sorry for the mis-communication. I agree that in this particular case, we are probably better off without the enum, especially since we can hopefully remove one or two of the bools in the medium term.

For example, it might be useful to also include the line numbers into the expectations.
