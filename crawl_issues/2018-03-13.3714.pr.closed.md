Fixed small typo, "also" should be "all".

This is not a typo. The `also` was meant to state that since smart contracts are a special case of software, any guidelines for writing software "also" applies to smart contracts.

How did you interpret it?

I interpreted the `also` as a mistake. Here are a few suggestions that me that sentence pair less awkward to read:
- _... Therefore, even smart contract should be ..._
- _... This software is no exception, and all smart contracts should be created following ..._
- _All software is written by humans, and may contain bugs. Since smart contracts are a special case of software, any guidelines for writing software also apply to smart contracts, and should be created following well-known best-practices in software development._

My personal preference would be the last version. Thanks a lot for looking into this! Unfortunately, we do not have a native English speaker on our team :)

Not a problem. Will be glad to read over and correct documentation as I learn more about the project.

Should I make a new PR or can the approving reviewer modify my commit?

If you force-push to the same branch, the pull request will just update, so please do not open a new one.

As mentioned "I took the suggested text", which was the 3rd from the list above.

Oh I'm sorry, then I did not read the list properly. While I think the current paragraph should be expanded, I would not consider this PR an improvement at this stage.

The first sentence is still weird and as there is no progress on this, I'm closing this PR.
