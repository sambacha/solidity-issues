# [\#3716 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3716) `closed`: Optimizer cannot delay writes to `length` when adding multiple elements
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

Code of the form
```
x.push(1);
x.push(2);
x.push(3);
```
has 6 `sstore` instructions. It should be possible to remove the two intermediate `sstore`s that increment the length. This is currently not done, since the optimizer also takes into account the case where the data area of an array overlaps with the slot that stores the length. Because of that, it always has to re-fetch the length after the data has been stored.

We can 'fix' this by
(1) just assuming that these areas never overlap.
(2) introducing more complicated code that actually checks whether the slots coincide and only re-fetches the data in that case.

Some thoughts on how (2) might be done:

push is roughly implemented in the following way:
```
function push(x, d)
{
  let length := sload(x)
  let data := keccak256(x) // actually uses memory
  sstore(x, add(length, 1))
  sstore(add(data, length), d)
}
```

The inlined code for `x.push(1); x.push(2)` would be something like

```
{
  let length1 := sload(x)
  let data := keccak256(x)
  sstore(x, add(length1, 1)) // this is what we want to remove
  sstore(add(data, length1), 1)
  let length2 := sload(x) // need to load again due to potential overlap
  sstore(x, add(length2, 1))
  sstore(add(data, length2), 2)
}
```

The version optimized according to (2) would be

```
{
  let length1 := sload(x)
  let data := keccak256(x)
  let tmp := add(length1, 1) // we do not write to storage, but keep as temp data
  sstore(add(data, length1), 1)
  let length2 := tmp // we opportunisticly assume that x != data + length1
  if eq(add(data, length1), x) { length2 := sload(x) } // If not, we perform the load
  sstore(x, add(length2, 1))
  sstore(add(data, length2), 2)
}
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
