# [\#3734 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3734) `merged`: test: Rename test/TestHelper.* to test/Options.* and add Options::val…

…idate().

Came up in #3731.

Some questions about proper procedure:
- Should I always first create an issue even for quick changes such as this one?
- This pull request also fixes some includes throughout the tests to use absolute paths - strictly speaking this would have to be a separate commit and pull request - are you OK with such small and harmless side-changes if they come up during a commit?

To be discussed:
- Should test/TestHelper.* actually be renamed to test/Options.*? Since TestHelper only contained the Options class I would say this makes sense - one may want to add another TestHelper.h header that includes Options.h, though, if one expects further test helpers in the future.

@ekpyron I like the renaming as proposed. Even though it's just a small change, it increases consistency and readability. Plus, as you said, it only contains ``class Option`` which deserves a more specific filename than just ``TestHelper`` :)

I think no if it was discussed in another issue/PR.

> This pull request also fixes some includes throughout the tests to use absolute paths - strictly speaking this would have to be a separate commit and pull request - are you OK with such small and harmless side-changes if they come up during a commit?

In general I'd prefer different logical changes to be separate.
