Rebased but I am not likely to continue to work on this soon. I welcome anyone to take it

Do we want to take that in scope for 0.5.0 or not?

I think enforcing the use of ``override`` is a good idea and vote for it.

How would we solve the problem described by @chriseth above? Should we disallow compilation of C?

First suggestion: In that situation it only compiles if the most derived contract contains (or inherits) a function called `f` with a modifier `override(A,B)`. So the general rule would be:

A function that overrides a function of the same name and parameter types from a base contract `BaseContract` needs to either have a `override` or `override(BaseContract)` modifier. If a contract `C` inherits from multiple contracts which contain functions of the same name and parameter types, then `C` also has to define such a function with the modifier `override(A,B, ..., )`.

There is a special case where `C` inherits from both `A` and `B`; and `A` also inherits from `B` - not sure if `override(A)` would be sufficient is that case, but I think it is better to be explicit and require both `A` and `B`.

Closing as there are conflicts and this can be easily recreated.
