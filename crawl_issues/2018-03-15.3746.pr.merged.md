@chriseth is ccache broken or what is the motivation in disabling it?

The statistics output says that the cache was hit zero times consistently for all possible runs on circle. On the other hand, downloading and uploading the cache takes quite some time. So I would propose to disable it and try again at some other point in time.

I am indifferent in keeping or removing them, unless @chfast wants to have a look into?

I talked to @chfast, he said he disabled ccache on all CI runs for cpp-ethereum.

I was never able to make ccache work on Travis. The hit count was always 0 in the end.
