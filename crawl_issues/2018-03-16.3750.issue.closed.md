the first example is still used ```pragma solidity ^0.4.16``` as the other examples in the same doc already update to ^0.4.21; 
and in this example, it still have out of date comment for ```require```

```
            // If the argument of `require` evaluates to `false`,
            // it terminates and reverts all changes to
            // the state and to Ether balances. It is often
            // a good idea to use this if functions are
            // called incorrectly. But watch out, this
            // will currently also consume all provided gas
            // (this is planned to change in the future).
            require(
                (msg.sender == chairperson) &&
                !voters[voter].voted &&
                (voters[voter].weight == 0)
            );
```

We try to always use the oldest version of Solidity that is still able to compile the code. Thanks for telling us about the outdated comment!

@axic. :wave: thanks for the atMention, but you need to [install @gitcoinbot on this repo for me to be able to respond](https://github.com/apps/gitcoinbot).  More details [in the documentation](https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/tree/master/app/gitcoinbot).

@netrunnerX can you claim the bounty without us installing the app on the repo?

@chriseth I wish, the problem is that I must pay gas to submit work on Gitcoin and I have 0 eth ðŸ˜… . I have to find a way to buy some eth.

Hi @chriseth @netrunnerX sorry for the delay on our side here, and for Gitcoin Bot running wild. Sincerely apologize and will clean up Gitcoin Bot accordingly. cc @owocki

Yes, @netrunnerX can claim without you installing the app. 

@netrunnerX - feel free to make a submission to the [Gitcoin Faucet](gitcoin.co/faucet), which will distribute you enough ETH to submit work. From there, we will pay out for this bounty!

Hi @vs77bb ,

I'm trying to submit a request to Gitcoin Faucet, but it returns an error:
"The submitted github profile shows a pending faucet distribution."

The weird thing is that i haven't submitted a previous request. The only thing I did before was check the URL before going out of home.
Is there a way to see if I really have a pending distribution?

Thank you!
