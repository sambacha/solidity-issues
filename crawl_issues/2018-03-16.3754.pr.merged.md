# [\#3754 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3754) `merged`: Error on non existing or irregular files 

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21401?v=4" width="50">[AnthonyBroadCrawford](https://github.com/AnthonyBroadCrawford) opened issue at [2018-03-16 15:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3754):

Fixes #3037.

## Decisions 
When implementing this feature I took the following approach 

1. Error and exit compilation if a non-existent or irregular file is encountered (per request in issue #3037)
2. Create a new flag --ignore-missing that will continue compilation rather than error out when a missing or irregular file is encountered

## Sample commands 
Here's a simple way to test it when compiling this branch.  This is executed from the ***build*** directory with the attached simple contract located in the same ***build*** directory 

*NO ERROR: * `./solc/solc --bin --ignore-missing test.sol missing-file.sol`
*ERROR* `./solc/solc --bin test.sol missing-file.sol`

## Sample contract 
Again, my above commands assume this is located in the *build* director 

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

contract Test {

}
```

@chriseth @axic I've taken all feedback from the previous PR and created a new one.  This is for issue #3037.  All feedback from previous PR has been incorporated.  

1.  Return bool vs. exit(1) 
2. Also error when an irregular file is encountered 
3. Move feature in Changelog to 0.4.22 section 
4. Back out my mistakes on accidentally moving braces, etc in unrelated functions.

@chriseth I implemented all your feedback on the coding styles (my apologies for missing those details the first time) and your feedback on breaking it out into two separate messages with your proposed message format.  

Please let me know if you have any other feedback.  Thanks for all the feedback so far.

@chriseth @axic 

I know you two are busy, but wanted to see what other feedback you have so we can wrap up this PR and close the ticket.  

I've implemented all feedback currently on the PR & happy to make additional changes.  Thank you so much for your feedback & time so far.
