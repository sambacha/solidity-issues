I have the output of my cmake run using the following syntax:
```
C:...>cmake -CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG  -CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/"Program Files"/Emscripten/emscripten/1.5.6/cmake/Platform/Emscripten.cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH= C
:/Program Files/Emscripten/emscripten/1.5.6/cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G "MinGW Makefiles" .ï¿½
```
  I have the Include file and Library directory file set correctly and tried a few different Library paths but keep getting the error below:
```
**Could not find the following static Boost libraries:

          boost_regex
          boost_filesystem
          boost_unit_test_framework

          boost_system**
This is the complete output in my Windows command line:

Sorry for not answering this earlier.

Did you had any chance fixing this problem? I am not sure we can offer much help in Emscripten compilation on Windows. Please have a look at `scripts/build_emscripten.sh` to see how we build it on Linux.

Closed due to inactivity. Please reopen if the issue persists of if you have more questions.
