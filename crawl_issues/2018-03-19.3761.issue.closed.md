Create a section in the documentation explaining changes introduced by 0.5.0.

Most of these need to be found based on:
- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2511#issuecomment-361469013
- changelog
- source code and/or git commit history :)

Should we make a new section just below in the name of " v.0.5.0 features"  and put the #2511 (comment) and changelog ?
