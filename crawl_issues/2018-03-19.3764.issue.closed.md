**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`

The instructions for building from source on Windows should be updated to reflect the latest version of Visual Studio. This include this cmake command:

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..`

The documentation probably should also mention that VS Build Tools should be installed.

Someone with access to Windows please verify this and update the documentation :)
