This would simplify the code in `ExpressionCompiler` added by #3308.

@chriseth Hmm, is this still relevant?

I'm not sure if it's still relevant but I wanted to add that this is probably much simpler now than it was back then. `TupleType` and `ReferenceType` both inherit from `CompositeType` (#9746) so we could just move the pure virtual declarations of these functions there.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
