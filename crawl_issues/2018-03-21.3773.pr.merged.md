@axic Added missing tests.

Looks good to me!

@axic I've realised that the tests used the legacy AST output instead of the new compact one. That's the reason why checks for ``typeName`` and ``typeString`` were missing. I've changed that...

Not sure about ``t_array$_t_array$_t_uint256_$dyn_storage_$dyn_storage_ptr`` for ``uint[][] memory rows;``. It still looks wrong, but I wasn't sure how to fix the ``richIdentifier`` for ``ArrayType``.

@chriseth What do you think about this remaing issue?

The rich identifier is fine, it is only important that it is really unique. They are not really exposed to the user as much as the other stuff is.

Basically just extend all the other test cases with `typeIdentifier` expectation if they define a type.

@axic The JSON AST tests are using the legacy JSON output. That's why you won't find ``typeIdentifier`` but rather ``typeName`` and ``type``. Actually those do not cover my changes since they only apply when using ``solc --ast-compact-json``. I think changing the tests such that they use the new output could be done while deprecating the legacy output for 0.5.0.

I think I'd rather add some tests that cover non-shortened type pointer as you suggested.

In that case I think we should introduce two sub suites to group the legacy and the "compact" tests.

Great idea, will do that!

I actually meant that there can be multiple sub-levels of `BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(<name>)` within a single suite.

Also the case `documentation` contains both legacy and non-legacy tests, probably needs to be split into two.

@axic Ok, my idea was to split them into 2 files right away, in order to not end up with a very large one at some point. But if you prefer a single file with multiple sub-suites, I'll put it back. I don't have a stong opinion on that.

I've pulled out the legacy part of the ``documentation`` test. Did I miss something?

I don't have any preference, but if it is a split file I'd name it `ASTLegacyJSON`.

@axic I've renamed the legacy file / suite and added two tests that cover long ``typeDescriptions`` for binary operations and identifiers.
