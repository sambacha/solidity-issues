Bottle is a prebuilt homebrew package. Currently our homebrew is source only, it will be compiled every single time at the users' computer.

Implementation for bottles: https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/pull/119

What is required here is building it for different (or at least that last macOS release) in our release tooling. This requires a CI which runs macOS properly.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
