# [\#3783 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3783) `closed`: Simplify struct definition.

```
'struct' Identifier '{' ( VariableDeclaration ';' (VariableDeclaration ';')* )? '}'
```
is equivalent to
```
'struct' Identifier '{' (VariableDeclaration ';')* '}'
```

I just simplified it.

You are correct, however I think the original definition was wrong, because it allows `struct`s without any members (the trailing `?` should be removed).

@chriseth is there any point supporting empty structs? (The parser currently accepts it.)

I think the idea was to support some kind of unit type, but I fear it creates more problems than it solves (because it would occupy zero space), so I'm fine with disallowing.

@dm4 thank you for bringing this to our attention.

It seems we have decided to disallow empty structs (#3790) and as such this PR is obsolete. Closing this PR for now.

Please comment if you think empty structs should remain.
