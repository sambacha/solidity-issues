# [\#3805 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3805) `merged`: Removed documentation reference to var for tuple variable assignment

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/661291?v=4" width="50">[kevinflo](https://github.com/kevinflo) opened issue at [2018-04-02 05:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3805):

This is a fix for the documentation as mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3669
The problem was that the documentation still referenced the now-depricated var way of assigning variables from tuples

This was brought to light in discussion here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3301#issuecomment-372589186

My first contribution attempt here. Let me know if there's anything I should change.

Ah, I just checked and there are some more occurrences of `var (` in the documentation. Could you please take another look?

I actually looked at this yesterday and started to change some parts of the documentation with regards to `var`.

Merging, still better than nothing. But it does not close the issue.
