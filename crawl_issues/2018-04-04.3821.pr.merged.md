# [\#3821 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3821) `merged`: Warn constructor override

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-04-04 13:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3821):

Refs #3325.

Closes #3305. Rebases the changes of #3305 and extends them to also check for overriding ancestor constructor calls and to allow overriding constructor calls with no arguments.

Does not close issue #3325, since the last comment ``Furthermore, if parentheses are given, the number of arguments has to match the number of parameters (currently, empty parentheses is the same as no parentheses)`` is not yet addressed - I suggest to do that in a separate pull request.

@ekpyron I think you can directly push into @federicobond's branch and so update the original PR.

@axic I tried to, but I didn't have permission to push there, so I merged the branch from the fork into a branch here and created this new PR instead.

There's still an issue with multiple inheritance I only noticed now and that I still have to fix.

I added a test case for the multiple inheritance setting that currently fails - That needs to be fixed before this can be merged.

All tests should work now. I changed the behaviour to only issue a warning unless in experimental 0.5.0 mode, since it's a breaking change.

@ekpyron can you please rebase?

Test failures seem to be unrelated to this PR...

Note: this could/should be squashed once reviews are done.
