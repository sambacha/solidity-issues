Fixed all.

> Perhaps we could also add a semantics check that uses swap and lt in inline assembly, but not required.

What do you mean by that? Whether it is picked up by the optimiser?

@axic no, a check that it does not change semantics, but that is probably hard because this stage cannot be disabled.

We can generate some end-to-end test cases in the form of:
```
function f(uint a, uint b) returns (uint c) {
  assembly {
    a
    b
    swap1
    lt
    =: c
  }
}
```

And run it with a range of known values?

Yes, that was my idea but now I realize that this will not be possible with 0.5.0 anymore. I'm fine with the state of the PR as it is.

Well we can remove it there and then, but at least it may give us more confidence until that time comes.

@chriseth added end-to-end tests for both optimisers
