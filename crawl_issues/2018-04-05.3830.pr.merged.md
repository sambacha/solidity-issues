Did you remove the changelog entry?

@chriseth Oh - apparently the changelog entry somehow got lost during rebasing - I restored it.

There is one issue with the solution in this PR.

Consider the paths (1) ``/allowed_dir/non_existing/../contract.sol`` and (2) ``/allowed_dir/non_existing/../../contract.sol``, assuming that ``/allowed_dir/contract.sol`` exists.

The pre-boost-1.60 implementation will treat (1) and (2) as non-existing (regardless of whether ``/contract.sol`` exists or not), whereas the boost>=1.60 implementation will resolve (1) as existing and treat (2) as outside the allowed directories.

In either case no information from outside the allowed directories is leaked, but the behaviour is not entirely consistent. Unfortunately changing this would require to implement ``boost::filesystem::path::lexically_normal`` for boost <1.60, which in turn would require platform specific code.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2018-04-10 08:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3830#issuecomment-380025129):

So there are several options:

* Merge this as is, accepting the slight inconsistency of builds with different boost versions.
* Add platform specific ``#ifdef``'s to libdevcore to re-implement boost>=1.60's ``lexically_normal`` (in particular Windows paths have to be treated specially, since ``C:\..`` should not result in the empty path).
* Only use the implementation for boost<1.60 for now and change to ``boost::weakly_canonical`` simultanously for all builds, once we can bump the minimum boost version.
* ...

In any case we should not take too long to merge this, since the current version of ``solc`` *will* leak information about non-allowed directories: if you import a file outside the allowed directories that does not exist, ``boost::canonical`` will throw, resulting in the ``unknown exception``, whereas if it does exist, the error is ``File outside of allowed directories.`` - thus current ``solc`` allows to detect file existence everywhere.

I added this to be done in ``0.4.22``, since it is a security issue.

I'd prefer using the current implementation for all builds and then bump the version number simultanously once we can. We have to make sure that our implementation is correct anyways, so why not be consistent here. The platform-specific solution might result in too much overhead since we need to test and maintain the code just to throw it out again soon.

@bit-shift Unit tests for what? Expected error messages for calling ``solc``? Do we even have a suitable testing infrastructure for that yet?

@ekpyron Oh sorry, could have been more specific. I thought of some tests for ``weaklyCanonical``, but maybe that's not even necessary.

As far as I'm concerned this can be merged once the tests go through.
