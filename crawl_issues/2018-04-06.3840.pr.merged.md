# [\#3840 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3840) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Integration with CVC4

Added CVC4 as an option for the SMT backend.
Z3 is still the default solver. CVC4 is only used when Z3 is not available.
The next step is writing the double solver that uses both and solves _everything_.

This was done in preparation for the next step when we use both, in which case it makes sense to check for CVC4 even if Z3 is found.

The makefile changes look good.

Also needs a changelog entry.

Added Changelog entry and fixed review suggestions

`isValid` had to be removed from smtlib, since its current version only checks for the "native operators". Both z3/cvc4 will try to replace constants and user functions before hitting `isValid`.

We may want to change that to only validate if the name is a `native operator`.

@axic Good catch, SMTLib will return for constants before, but not for new functions.
We could have two functions in the SolverInterface, the one that was just introduced, and another one that does the same but is also fine with new functions. This way, Z3 and CVC4 can use the restricted version, since they know that at that point the expression should be a native operator.

@chriseth OK to merge now?

@leonardoalt can you rebase to ensure the changelog entry is in the right spot?

Ok to merge. We are basically still in the same mode, since we need to create the bugfix release, but let's try anyway.

@chriseth rebased and applied changes, please review
