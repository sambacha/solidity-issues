This check could just as well be moved to the ``TypeChecker`` class - since whole subexpressions are (attempted to be) evaluated I chose the ``StaticAnalyzer`` so far, but if you feel the code is better suited for the type checker, I'll move it there.

I noticed a separate issue while working on this PR:

``ConstantEvaluator`` did not correctly handle single element tuples - and parentheses in arithmetic expressions end up being single element tuples in the AST.

Before this PR ``ConstantEvaluator`` was only used to calculate array lengths.

The first commit therefore extracts the array length syntax tests.
The second commit fixes ``ConstantEvaluator`` and adds a new test case to validate the fix.
The third commit fixes the original issue.

@axic @chriseth Should I split the PR in two parts or are you fine with merging it at once?

I think splitting makes sense, especially if it will take longer to review that change (the only time consuming part I can think about is adding more test cases).

I extracted the ConstantEvaluator fixes to #3862.

@ekpyron so this should have the other commits removed then? And please check https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3848#discussion_r180741822

Should be mergeable then.

This seems to be failing on a test:
```
signed_rational_modulus - SolidityNameAndTypeResolution
failure

ASSERTION FAILURE:
- file   : SolidityNameAndTypeResolution.cpp
- line   : 4934
- message: check success((text)) has failed

@axic This still depends on #3862 - that's why I added the depends note in the original PR message and left the commits in there. I'll rebase once #3862 is merged, then the tests should be fine. I'll have to look into the ``signed_rational_modulus`` case, though.

I noticed that after I pushed, but figured we'll just merge the other one and resolve this after.

I just rebased - the ``signed_rational_modulus`` test failing is an error in this PR, though, so I'll have to fix that (the value of the RationalNumberType is currently converted to an uint and therefore -0.4... is considered 0 as well).

I'll also add some more tests.

@chriseth With what expectation? I could add something like
``uint constant a = 1 / (uint(keccak256([0])[0]) - uint(keccak256([0])[0]))``
but as of now this will not cause an error, since the constant evaluator won't evaluate pure functions...
For the same reason ``uint[a] m;`` with above ``a`` will cause an error...
Should we instead open an issue for looking into extending the constant evaluator to also evaluate pure functions (we already briefly discussed that this may be problematic, though - for the same reason why constant expressions are not always evaluated right away so far)? Or maybe I did not understand what kind of test you had in mind?

@axic I added some more tests in a separate commit, although those cases are not directly related to this PR.

@ekpyron I just would like a test that shows that the constant evaluator does not crash for such cases.

@chriseth I added another test case with an explanatory comment.
