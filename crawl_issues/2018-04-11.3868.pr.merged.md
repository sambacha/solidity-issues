# [\#3868 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3868) `merged`: Properly force-clean for shortening bytesXX conversions.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3867

It seems like the proper thing is done for integers, but not for bytesXX types.

This is weird, because we actually have a test for this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp#L1580

Ok, I think I can see why this is still fine in most cases: Whenever we store in storage, we chop additional bits, so storage is safe. Whenever we store in memory, we do an additional cleanup, and for that additional cleanup, we either widen (implicit conversion) or we do not change the size at all. In both cases, the typeOnStack is the shorter one, so we do proper cleanup.

The only case where this can be problematic that I can think of is:

```
contract test {
    function f() public pure returns (bytes32 r) {
        bytes32 x = bytes32(-1);
        bytes8 a = bytes8(x);
        assembly { r := a }
    }
}
```

Doesn't the ABI encoder does cleaning on its own?

A better test would be:
```
function f(bytes4 in) returns (bytes2 out) {
  out = in;
  assembly {
    if eq(in, out) { invalid() }
  }
}
```

Finished.

Will add documentation to inline assembly that states when accessing local variables, short types are not guaranteed to have clean higher order bits.

Updated.
