# [\#3873 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3873) `merged`: Fix internal compiler error when parsing ``var`` declaration without …

…identifier.

Fixes #3039.

Arguably instead parsing ``var`` with ``_options.allowVar == false`` could be a fatal parser error, but the plan was to get away from those and try to continue parsing gracefully whenever possible.

Slightly unrelated, but do we have a test for `var` as storage variables?

```
contract C {
  var a;
  var b = 1;
}
```

@axic At a quick glance I didn't find a parser test for that, so I added a simple one here (It causes a fatal parser error right at ``var`` at the moment, so we don't have to check for the case of assignments, etc.).

@axic Not sure what kinds of tests you had in mind - there were versions with named and unnamed parameters for each case already. Multiple arguments? Mixed arguments? I just added a few more, but actually they're all conceptually the same...

Maybe my eyes are really bad, but when I left my comment those cases weren't there.
