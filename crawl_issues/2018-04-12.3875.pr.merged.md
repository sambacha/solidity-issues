I agree, this is not the way to fix it :)

I think the condition in StaticAnalyzer.cpp:209 has to be tighter than it currently is.

I think https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3861 and  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3843 are basically the same thing.

OK, I remembered talking about this with you and concluding that such arguments would be an error in general - that's why I went ahead and did it this way :-).

Since there can only be one constructor per contract, how can a constructor with another contract of the same type ever be called in the first place :-)? I'm just wondering what such an example could look like...

ok, that's a fair point, but we also have interfaces and stuff...

I wouldn't restrict it in such a way.

Alright!

This should be valid:

```
contract C {
  C parent;

  function hasParent() pure internal returns (bool) {
    return address(parent) != 0;
  }

  function C(C _parent) {
    parent = _parent;
  }

  function fork() returns (C) {
    require(!hasParent(), "multiple level of forks are not allowed");
    return new C(this);
  }
}
```

And the the first create transaction can just pass an address 0 for the initial contract.

Ah OK! I hadn't thought about that!

@ekpyron can you just fix it here properly? :)

@axic OK - my plan was to open a new PR once it's finished, but I might as well reuse this one :-). I'll be away for an hour now, though, so it'll take until afterwards.

I think I need some clarification on this one. I'm not sure this *can* be properly fixed.

Are there cases in which an occurrence of ``this`` is valid, resp. shouldn't be warned about? For example what about the following case?
```
contract C {
    address m_d;
    constructor(address d) public {
        m_d = d;
    }
}
contract D {
    C m_c;
    constructor() public {
        m_c = new C(this);
    }
}
```

The discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1646#issuecomment-305026348 seems to indicate that this should be valid.

If this shouldn't trigger a warning, then it might be tricky to warn about cases like this:

```
contract C {
    address m_d;
    constructor(address d) public {
        m_d = d;
    }
    function d() public view returns (address) {
        return m_d;
    }
}
contract D {
    C m_c;
    constructor() public {
        m_c = new C(this);
        D(m_c.d()).f();
    }
    function f() public pure {
    }
}
```

Recognizing that ``D(m_c.d())`` will evaluate to ``this`` during the analysis phase is non-trivial (and impossible in general, since it may depend on run-time state in more complex examples).

The original discussion in #583 is rather inconclusive as well...

The current state of the PR warns about these cases:
```
contract C {
  function f() public {
  }
  constructor() {
    this.f();
    (this).f();
  }
}
```
But will already fail to warn for this case:
```
contract C {
  function f() public {
  }
  constructor() {
    C c = this;
    c.f();
  }
}
```

So currently I'm not sure - it doesn't seem that we can warn in all cases that warrant a warning, but I'm not sure which subset of them I should try to catch...

Sorry, I think this is still not a good solution. I'll improve it now and comment after I'm done.

Now it should be fine - although IMO it's not particularly nice this way.

I'm really starting to think that we should consider #3878.
