# [\#3883 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3883) `closed`: Ensure that jsoncpp installed on the system won't interface with the builtin one in CMake
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

It seems that in certain cases when jsoncpp headers are lingering as a system installation they may interfere with the built in version.

This is the case in https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/issues/163 and #3467 (our attempt to update jsoncpp).

I think I also exerince this from time to time. I guess the proper fix would be to prefer our version of the jsoncpp headers before the system headers.

@chfast could you perhaps help here?

I will inspect the CMake scripts.

The solution is simple but hard to achieve and requires CMake discipline. You must make sure that system deps are behind local deps and libs in dependency tree (depth-first).

Easy test is to run `make VERBOSE=1` and check if there is `-I/usr/include` before `-I<local-deps>`.

Can you list of your current dependencies?

I notices Boost includes were before JSONCPP includes. Fixed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3888.
This is hard to test on Linux where it seems the `/usr/include` (Boost) is implicit so CMake skips it anyway.

@chfast can this be closed?

Give me an hour.

I wanted to test it on macOS, but you don't have macOS in CI.

I tested it with invalid header `/usr/include/json/json.h` and it built fine on Linux.
