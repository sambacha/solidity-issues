Also missing a changelog entry :)

How should I add a changelog entry since it goes under a new release?

No idea why the check is failing, since apparently no tests failed...

There should be an entry now.

If you add more tests about the two types of hex literals (`hex"aabb"` and `0xaabb`) and strings ("abc") and how they can be implicitly converted to (a) bytesN types of the same size and (b) bytesN types of larger sizes, this can be merged.

So should I leave it where it can't convert a shorter rational or should I try to fix it?

@meowingtwurtle the changes you made are fine, I just would like to know the behaviour for the examples I gave, especially when there are leading zeros.

@chriseth Made requested changes.

Took the conversion from literals out of scope (it actually never was in scope) and opened a new issue for that: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3942

@axic actually - this is a breaking change, right?

Yes, it would be breaking, since it is disallowing something previously permissible.

Please coordinate with @ekpyron and update.

@ekpyron As I said in Gitter, I'm not sure what exactly the semantic differences between this and #4091 were. It appears that this might be obsolete since your PR seems to have mostly handled #3786.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2018-05-15 21:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3899#issuecomment-389314842):

The main difference between this and #4091 is that #4091 did not change the conversion from literals to bytes types. Instead in ``RationalNumberType::isExplicitlyConvertibleTo`` the conversion to fixed bytes types is still explicitly allowed. This is the same behaviour as before, so bytes4(1234), etc., are still valid. Regarding conversions between integers and fixed bytes types this PR and #4091 are pretty much exactly the same.

So #4091 indeed solved #3786, but did not yet touch #3942, whereas this PR already (at least partly) addresses #3942.

So I think a reasonable thing to do would be to rebase this PR (the 050 branch already includes #4091 by now) and then to use it to address #3942. Another option would be to close this PR and open a new one for #3942.

Okay, I'll rebase when I get a chance.

@ekpyron was this work duplicated under #4091 ?

@axic Parts of it was duplicated in #4091 (unfortunately, I hadn't seen @meowingtwurtle's previous work, when I started with the issue), but #4091 was more restricted - it did not involve fixing #3942 as well, whereas I think the idea was that this one should now extend upon #4091 and address #3942.

@ekpyron since you have worked on the complementary PR to this, are you interested in working on this one?

I think this may not be dependent too much on external tests, but who knows.

Dead, superseded by @ekpyron in #4696

@meowingtwurtle Sorry again for the whole confusion and duplications with this PR (my fault) - but I thought it easier to start from scratch with #4696 now.

Oh yeah, definitely. No problem.
