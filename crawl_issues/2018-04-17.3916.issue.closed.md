with `pragma pedantic;`.

This could be a middle ground between having warnings which can be turned off. Opinionated warnings could go under the pedantic mode.

One such example is #3915.

I'm not sure about this. Compiler warnings are mostly, but not only for the developers. If we enforce pedantic mode, then people cannot that easily be fooled by functions named 'constructor'.

If we make it optional, then scammers just don't use it.

With another mode, every design decision takes more time.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
