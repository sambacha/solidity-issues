# [\#3918 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3918) `closed`: Truncate linkerObject at the beginning, not end
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

When a importing a library with a long path, the unresolved name in the bin file gets truncated at tail end, and contract name is lost. This makes it impossible to link against.

Thank you for the pull request! In my opinion, this change is a breaking change and cannot be done before 0.5.0. I would actually rather remove the truncated library names than change their alignment.

@chriseth I agree, removing the truncation would be much nicer. I can see two options:
1. Removing the 40 limit for unresolved addresses; this would that in a bin file with unresolved libraries the offsets are wrong. That might be worth it.
2. Hash the contract name and/or filename. That might work but hashing is non-reversable, so it would make files less readable.

What do you think?

I think they are entirely deprecated because the new JSON format gives offsets properly.

For a proper big break, I'd consider to change each value to:
- a unique identifier (index from 0) per compilation
- the index within the `linkReferences`

This way the content is still parseable, but cannot be used without the standard JSON format, which is the aim.

@seanyoung a hash sounds nice too, but has to be less than 160 bits given the requirement of underscores on both sides. Otherwise the contract may be deployed with random "linked" addresses.

Allow me to comment as I worked with @seanyoung on this.
We realize that a better long-term solution is needed and this was an easy way to stay (somewhat) backwards-compatible with the pre 0.4.9 behavior of using only the library name as the unresolved reference. This PR guarantees that the library name is visible on the right-hand side of the reference. Otherwise, projects using imports from other directories have no chance of creating the linking instructions directly (without the additional json output, as was possible before, see also https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1645). My assumption is that there are two types of projects:
1. The ones that copy all contracts into the same directory before compiling
2. The ones that use imports across directories and are forced to use json output

This change would be transparent to type 1.) projects (or any project where the import path fits into the 40 bytes). Type 2.) project would also not be affected by this change as they rely on json output.

We tried using `solc --standard-json` and parsing the linkReferences, but ran into issues since that particular mode of solc does not resolve local (same directory) imports, e.g. `import "./Test.sol";`. Is that a known issue?

We're currently using this patch on top of 0.4.21 to compile and link without resorting to standard-json output and we're interested in helping create a long-term solution that is more reliable. Do you think this ticket is a good place to discuss or is there a separate one that you're aware of?

Please note that every other mode of operation is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

> We tried using solc --standard-json and parsing the linkReferences, but ran into issues since that particular mode of solc does not resolve local (same directory) imports, e.g. `import "./Test.sol";`. Is that a known issue?

Not really. Please create issues whenever they are encountered to give us a chance fixing them 😉 

> We're currently using this patch on top of 0.4.21 to compile and link without resorting to standard-json output and we're interested in helping create a long-term solution that is more reliable.

Do you distribute that version? If so, what is the version number (do you append a marker to the version)? Otherwise it is quite hard for outsiders to validate your contracts.

> Do you think this ticket is a good place to discuss or is there a separate one that you're aware of?

Usually we prefer having issues for discussions (because PRs are more transient discussion wise and a lot of people are only checking issues and not PRs), so if you think this will take longer to resolve, please open an issue. Actually, I think it will make much more sense discussing this in an issue, with more context and problems you've encountered. Can you please create one?

Closing because standard-json provides a better fix and this would be a breaking change that does not properly fix the underlying issue. Created a new issue for the local file resolution.
