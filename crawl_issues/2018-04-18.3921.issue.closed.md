# [\#3921 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3921) `closed`: Constructor doesn't working as expected

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14581509?u=4d0095a6804e63555ffcf8587eaca10268d9117a&v=4" width="50">[satyamakgec](https://github.com/satyamakgec) opened issue at [2018-04-18 05:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3921):

I have the simple contract 

    
    pragma solidity ^0.4.22;

    contract Demo22 {
    
    address public a;
    uint256 public b;
    
    constructor(address _a, uint256 _b) public {
        require(_a != address(0), "Address should not be zero");
        a = _a;
        b = _b;
    }
    
    function getValue() returns(address, uint256) {
        return(a,b);
    }
    }

Behaviour for constructor parameters
_a = 0, _b = 123
It get passed , I don't understand why It should fail as per the require condition. I am also giving the error message for the require but it doesn't print or provide any warning at the compilation time if I did not provide any message string in it.

And even I am not able to access the public variable directly or even not by the `getValue()` functions. It gives me a wired error `call to Demo22.a errored: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined`. 

Environment 
Javascript VM of Remix IDE

This seems to be a problem with remix. The constructor properly reverts, but remix still reports the contract to be deployed. Can you report it there, please?
