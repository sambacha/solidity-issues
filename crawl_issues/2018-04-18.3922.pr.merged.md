I think the assertions in `SMTChecker.cpp` are good to be changed, since they handle the translation from Solidity and show what feature is missing.

However in the internal parts it must only be using `unimplmented` if it is supported by certain parts of the code, while others don't support it yet and will be implemented. If it is for a future type (sort) which we don't even have yet it should remain a regular assertion.

Right, makes sense
