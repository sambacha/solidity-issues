We should check how this behaves with regard to `ExpressionClasses`, since some of these opcodes do not return anything.

> Please add tests.

I was wondering about that, since we only have tests for the peephole. Because other optimisations can be turned on, it is a bit harder to test for things in the simplification list.

Oh I'm sorry, I confused these operations, they actually all return something.

Optimiser.cpp and SolidityOptimzer.cpp should be appropriate to add tests.

Test seems to fail.

Do you have any idea why? The code looks ok, but I cannot test it due to cpp-ethereum still not working properly on mac.

I wouldn't rush this into 0.4.23 if we are releasing it today.

Fixed. It was missing the payable constructor.
