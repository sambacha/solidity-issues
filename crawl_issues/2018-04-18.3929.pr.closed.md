# [\#3929 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3929) `closed`: compile time reporting tool for solidity (as discussed on gitter)

This pull requests brings a compile time benchmarking feature into solidity, as discussed on the gitter channel https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev between @raphael-s-norwitz and @chriseth. It adds two new command line flags, `--ftime-report` and `--ftime-report-no-tree`. These flags do not alter any core compiler functionality, but provide a function call trace and time readings for each function call in the call stack. They are very similar to gcc's `--ftime-report` flag. See the following sample output:

These debugging statements are added in the code by putting a `t_stack.push(<argument>);` function call before the section of code you wish to debug, where <argument> is the string you wanted printed, and a `t_stack.pop()` call immidiately after. Remember that if you are putting a t_stack.push() and pop() around a section of code with multiple return statements, you must add a t_stack.pop() call before each return statements.

As of now we have added these sparingly, and only around core functions in the compiler execution. 

See the main implementation in `libsolidity/interface/FTime.h` and `libsolidity/interface/FTime.cpp`. The boost test cases are located in `test/libsolidity/FTimeTest.cpp`.

Wow, this looks great! Have you run it on some bigger contracts to see what takes a long time?

Of the function we profile here, for larger files, the three longest generally are `parse`, `analyze` and `appendMissingFunctions`. This shouldn't really be a surprise since they are very high level, but we are working on a more granular report, which we will share.

Suggestions of where to profile more would be very welcome!

The (original) Parity wallet and "the DAO" are quite big chunks of code with large contracts and functions. Then again they may use outdated constructs which are suboptimal.

Other examples I think tend to have a lot more abstraction and bite-size chunks so perhaps a lot of those would need to be profiled to draw proper conclusions.

I know we talked about that before, but at that time I thought this would just be a preliminary step to find the bottlenecks, but: What is the advantage of doing it like this over user an instrumented profiler?

Also, why didn't you use RAII to call `pop()`?

I personally am not very familiar with instrumented profiling. For our class we were taught that the best way to perform profiling in C++ is to use chrono high_resolution clock. We thought our solution was simple and flexible, and we didn't know about any details existing libraries could provide us with that we couldn't get with chrono. I see there are a few different instrumentation profiling libraries for C++ around, and if there is one you would like us to use, we have time to incorporate it. 

In terms of RAII, we thought the push/pop approach was more flexible in terms of what could be profiled. If we used RAII, it would be harder to put multiple profiles within the same block. If you would rather push() only semantics where only a block is profiled at once, we can change it.

I know you put a lot of effort into this, but I hope you understand that we don't merge it, since a similar effect can be achieved using profiling instrumentation.
