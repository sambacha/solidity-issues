@chfast I am not sure what I am doing, but this fixes it locally for me when I install `jsoncpp-1.8.4` in the system with homebrew.

Without these changes, I get the same error as shown in https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/issues/164

This works now locally (fixes the problem when jsoncpp is installed system wide by homebrew) and also fixes #3467.
