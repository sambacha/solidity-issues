# [\#3939 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3939) `closed`: Add modifier areas
**Labels**: `external contribution :star:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2018-04-18 21:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3939):

Closes #623.

Yes, the code here is pretty sloppy. Feedback (from maintainers and others) is welcome and encouraged!
I'm especially interested in hearing suggestions people have for syntax.

Syntax:
```
apply ... { ... }
```

The ellipsis after apply can contain any modifier invocations, a state mutability specifier, and a visibility mutability specifier, or any combination of the above. Inside the area there can be more modifier areas (modifier invocations are cumulative) and function declarations. Nested modifier areas and function declarations cannot have a different visibility or mutability than their modifier areas.

- [x] Modifier areas
- [x] Nested modifier areas
- [x] Visibility areas
- [x] Mutability areas
- [x] Some tests
- [ ] Lots of tests

Look at that... already found a (significant) bug. (now fixed)

@ekpyron , thanks for all of the feedback. I can't actually do anything for 5 days for personal reasons, but I will definitely look at it then :).

@meowingtwurtle No worries :-)!

What would be the syntax if we add visibility eventually? Something like this?

````
using visibility public {
    using modifier [mod], [mod], ... {
        <functions, sub-modifier areas>
    }
}
````
Or is it going to be possible to put visibility besides other modifiers? In that case, are we ok with prefixing the whole list with the keyword `modifier`?

**Edit: perhaps I should have brought this up in #623 or https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2608#issuecomment-317380570**

I would actually prefer to have visibility (and payability) specifiers and modifiers treated in the same way, although I would not use a comma as separator (we also do not have a comma in the function syntax).

Okay, I see two ways to do this, and I would love ideas:

1. Have **no** ModifierArea ASTNode, just add modifiers/visibility in parser. I'm not sure how I feel about this, really, since it kind of hides the fact that they exist at all.
2. Have a ModifierArea ASTNode. However, this introduces the problems already seen in my code (cyclic dependencies). One way to fix this would just to not give FunctionDefinitions a shared_ptr to their ModifierArea, but I don't really like this idea, since it means that FunctionDefinitions would no longer have all of their context necessary for generation.

@meowingtwurtle You should definitely have AST nodes for the modifier areas.

The main problem with the current code is that it leaks memory. Since the modifier area AST node contains shared pointers to the function definitions *and* the function definitions contain shared pointers to the modifier area, they can never be freed, since the reference counters of the shared pointers will never fall to zero. Do you see the problem?

The easiest solution for that would be to use a plain, non-reference-counted pointer to the modifier area in the function definitions. That way you still have access to the modifier area from the function definitions, but you still break the reference cycle. You can compare with e.g. ``Scopable`` in the AST. It contains a plain pointer to the scope instead of an ASTPointer (i.e. shared_ptr) for the very same reason. In general you want to use shared pointers from parent to child, but never from child to parent in the AST. That way the life-time of objects is guaranteed, but you still don't introduce cycles (i.e. reference cycles of shared pointers).

An alternative would be to *not* have a pointer to the modifier area in the function definitions themselves, but instead to add a (plain) pointer to ``FunctionDefinitionAnnotation`` and fill them in while traversing the AST later on. The solution above is probably simpler and perfectly fine (probably even better) in this case, though.

Okay, taking @ekpyron 's advice about pointers and @chriseth 's comment about visibility, mutability, and comma separation. (haven't finished yet)

Right now, the only way to differentiate between modifier area and using directive for parsing is whether or not the token after `using` is an identifier. This means that we have to have `modifier` or some other keyword/token after `using`. Or, we could use a different reserved keyword, like `apply`, here to signal it.

`apply` has now been selected to replace `using modifier`

Closing since this is unfortunately too much outdate for now :(
