The encoding isn't very different from local variables. In the beginning of every function the state vars are reset, meaning that their SSA index is increased and the new var is set to unknown.

Maybe we need more tests, not sure.

Added Changelog entry under 23 for now, will rebase later on.

`m_stateVariables` is included in `m_variables` when a function is visited, with the resets:
`m_variables.insert(m_stateVariables.begin(), m_stateVariables.end());`
