As requested by /u/chriseth I have changed the issues with the old constructor format still being present in the Inheritance section.  If there are any further places you know of with the old format, feel free to let me know and I can fix them in my branch and delay this pull request until they've all been fixed.

Can you please squash those changes into a single commit?

Closing pull request in order to create a better, more organized one.  Will need to practice squashing as I seem to have only created more commits.
