# [\#3964 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3964) `merged`: Updated constructors and pragma solidity lines.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6557206?u=506f4c6b17549c5b39edb663907477c610ccfaf4&v=4" width="50">[MatthewDLudwig](https://github.com/MatthewDLudwig) opened issue at [2018-04-20 20:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3964):

Updated the Inheritance section of the docs in order to correct old constructor formats and update them to the new constructor() format.

This is a second pull request as the first one fell into chaos as I attempted to merge my two commits together.  If anyone wants anything edited on this fork before merging let me know and this time I'll modify my first commit rather than making and attempting to merge more commits.

Replying from email right now as Iâ€™m away from my computer. The list you linked looks interesting, I may delve into a few when I have some spare time (#3849 looks interesting).
