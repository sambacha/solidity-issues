### Steps to reproduce:

1. Define two contracts:
```
contract A {}
```
```

### Expected result: 
Contracts to be compiled successfully

### Actual result: 
Solc crashed

### Output:

I assume you already read through this, but just incase I wanted to link Solidities documentation on this issue - https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#paths

I also noticed that you have a forward slash in one of your example and a backslash in another, could you have gotten them mixed up?

Finally is it possible back slashes have another meaning in Soliditiy and need to be escaped to work properly?

I'm aware that Solidity `import` statement accepts only forward slashes. 
That being said when you run solc from command line the command must obey the OS path rules. And Windows defines backslash as a primary path separator character (though supporting `/` as well)
So I believe that my example is valid and moreover the most correct way to call solc in the mentioned example.

Just to clarify this: I'm quite sure if I tried call solc manually I would use a forward slash. But I found this bug when called solc programmatically from java. 
And it generated a path with backslashes since java tries to conform to the specs as much as possible.
So I had to workaround this issue by converting `\` to `/` explicitely

I agree, the commandline interface should support both backslashes and forward slashes on windows, while import statements should only support forward slashes. This should all be taken care of by boost::filesystem, it just looks like there is a bug about how we distinguish directories and files.

I have fixed this bug by replacing the string() method with generic_string() to ensure backslash separated paths are also internally represented as paths separated with forward slashes.
