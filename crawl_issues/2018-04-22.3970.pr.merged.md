Thanks for the review @axic. I've moved the two docstring tests to the natspec dir.

Thanks! Can you also squash the two commits? :)

@axic sure, done. But may I suggest you to use the squash and merge button? That step should be applied by the maintainers, not by the contributors, IMO.

Too bad it removes the merge commit :(

@axic I think that's good. the maintainer gets to choose the format and contents of the merge commit, so you can keep it consistent. But despite all appearances, I'm not trying to convince you, it was just a suggestion ;)
