# [\#3972 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3972) `closed`: Set timeout to single SMT query
**Labels**: `help wanted`

Whenever we ask the CVC4 or Z3 solvers to check input for satisfiability, we should somehow limit how much time they can spend looking for a solution. The same might apply when we ask for a model, if that is not already done as part of checking for satisfiability. At best, this is just a setting for Z3 and CVC4. In the worst case, we have to set up the solver in a separate thread and somehow kill the thread or do whatever is necessary. If more drastic measures are taken, it of course has to be fully portable.

Hi @leonardoalt I'm not super familiar with the workflow/implementation here but:

- for CVC4 one can use `--tlimit-per` for single queries ...or `--rlimit-per` to use a resource count thus avoiding issues with determinism for multiple runs.
- for Z3 use `set_option(timeout=n)` to set a global timeout. Alternatively solver objects have a local `set` method.

Both in milliseconds.

Hi @jmahhh 
Thanks!
We're using the C++ APIs, so the z3 option is probably easy to set, but CVC4 doesn't have an API option for that, as far as I know.

@rofiqgilang note that you cannot use commandline options here, since we use the C / C++ interface to the solvers.

@vs77bb Howdy.  Apologies for the late reply. 

PR: I have started working with the CVC4 solver.  Am not sure how to limit the time spent looking for a solution.  I am working on the code in C++.  Hope to start working with Z3 soon.

Hi @vghorakavi ,
Z3 has a context option to set the time limit via the API, but CVC4 and SmtLibInteface don't. As described above, the general solution would be a portable code that runs the solver on a separate thread and kills it after the time limit answering `Unknown`.

According to https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4/issues/2174 the CVC4 API also has a way to set time limits, so we probably don't need an extra thread.
