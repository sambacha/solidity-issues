# [\#3978 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3978) `closed`: Forwarding via bytes should not pad
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

We should check that forwarding calls via `.call(msg.data)` and especially via `bytes memory x=msg.data; a.call(x);` does not pad.

Potentially proposed solution: With a breaking change, modify how arrays are encoded in packed way, do not pad them to multiples of 32 bytes.

Actually (sorry I already realized that in a different issue), `.call` does not perform packed encoding, but a weird third type of encoding. 

I would propose to change `call` to only take `bytes` and perform a "packed encoding" of that argument, i.e. combine this with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3955

This should probably only be fixed with 0.5.0 proper.
