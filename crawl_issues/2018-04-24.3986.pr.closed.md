While delegating 'voting right', add checks to makes sure that the 'weight (number of votes)'  is added to the 'proposal originally intended' by the sender.
**It's possible that the 'delegate' has a 'different interest'**, than that of the 'sender'. So, **make sure**, before assigning the 'voting right', that **the delegate's choice of proposal is SAME as the sender's choice of proposal**. **Otherwise**, the **sender's voting rights could be misused** towards the delegate's choice of proposal.

Sorry, but the idea behind delegated voting is that you entrust a certain person with the choice. If you don't you can just vote yourself.

Please reopen if you want to change the explanation accordingly.
