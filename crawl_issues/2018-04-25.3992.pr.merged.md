# [\#3992 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3992) `merged`: A couple of ABI spec improvements

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/791437?u=5bfe72964704be945c813280a1c0a41f5df5163d&v=4" width="50">[davesque](https://github.com/davesque) opened issue at [2018-04-25 01:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3992):

This PR does two things:

1. Adds a note to clarify that zero-tuples are an intended feature of the specification
2. Fixes apparent typos or inconsistencies in the choice of index notation used in the spec

#### For item 2:

The ABI spec begins by using 1-indexing.  I assume this is because 1-indexing is more common in mathematical expositions and the ABI spec seems to follow that style.  For that reason, it seemed appropriate to correct occurrences of 0-indexing to use 1-indexing and not the other way around.

Of course, if all that notation was chosen intentionally and there's something I'm just not understanding, please ignore me ðŸ™‚ .

Thanks a lot! Unfortunately, there is a conflicting pull request which does a similar thing. @axic can we merge at least one of them?

I can split the zero-length tuples comment into a different PR if it's still being decided whether or not that feature should be advertised.

Merged since it is an improvement over the current state.
