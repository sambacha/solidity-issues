Ah, there are some more nice style errors which I would agree to.

Can we merge the virtual desctructors nonetheless?

@chriseth I added a commit that fixes the member initialization problems. I did the fixes the easy way, basically i just initialize all members with uniform intialization - regardless whether they where already initialized in constructor initializer lists or not. This simplified the refactoring process drastically. 

However, the next step would be to fix the raw pointer data members. I guess they could be either replaced with smart-pointers, or we need to implement destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator for every class that having them. I guess that the address sanitizer problems are directly/indirectly based on the usage of raw pointer data members.

Ah ok, this does not really end :)

I would propose to fix every problem one by one, merge each individually and only activate the switch once that is done.

Concerning the raw pointer members: Is it enough to use `ClassName(ClassName const& _other) = default;`?

@chriseth ok, during the next days I will create individual PRs.. I want also find a way to optimize the current changes regarding the member initializations.. basically the stuff should only be needed, if a constructor is just not initializing all members.. I will take a look into that during the next days..

@chriseth just did a real review on the member initialization to do some optimizations.. i didnt saw any missing or wrongly initialized member.. it also looks like that we will never be able to enable `-Weffc++` by default - I thought somehow the checking behaviour can be somehow tweaked.. I only saw that it is possible to declare some headers as `system headers`, and for those no warnings will be shown at all.. I guess we should not do such things..

@aarlt do you want to create a PR for the virtual destructors (but without enabling `effc++`) ?

@chriseth I have the feeling that this PR created some confusion. Sorry for that! However, @chfast give feedback about `noexcept` on destructors..  thats a very good idea..

@aarlt I agree :)

Tried to rebase, but @aarlt disabled pushes to the repo :)

Is there still value in this PR?
