# [\#3997 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3997) `closed`: compiler using --standard-json doesn't error if incorrect version

If I try and compile a contract with `pragma solidity ^0.4.21` using the `--standard-json` option & solc version 0.4.18, the compiler will error complaining about the syntax for `emit MyEvent()` but with no mention that I am using an incorrect version of solc to compile the contracts.

I'm not sure if this is fixed in a more recent version or not

That is weird and should not happen. ~~Are you sure you are using 0.4.18 ?~~

Tried it in Remix and the problem indeed seems to be present.

Sorry, it is just the way the compiler works.

The version pragma is evaluated after the parsing stage and since the issue is a parser error, it doesn't even get to evaluate the version pragma.

I thought that might be the case. Thanks
