Probably this isn't fixing the root cause.

Also makes two tests to fail on circleci, but they are passing locally for me:
- block_deduplicator - Optimiser
- block_deduplicator_loops - Optimiser

It is failing here too. Why is the current `develop` version the correct with expected 2 tags left?

@chriseth can you check this version? Will need to squash commits before merge.

Changed the static assert to equal and it turns out emscripten has a 32-bit `size_t`:
```
/root/project/libevmasm/AssemblyItem.cpp:29:1: error: static_assert failed "size_t must be at most 64-bits wide"
static_assert(sizeof(size_t) == 8, "size_t must be at most 64-bits wide");
^             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/root/project/libevmasm/AssemblyItem.cpp:55:13: error: comparison of constant 18446744073709551615 with expression of type 'size_t' (aka 'unsigned int') is always true [-Werror,-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]
        if (_subId != 0xffffffffffffffffULL)
            ~~~~~~ ^  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

@aarlt can you test this on your picky computer with removing `& 0xffffffffffffffffULL`?

@axic Should I also check on my macOS?

@bit-shift if you had the same issue as @aarlt, then yes please

@axic oh wow! I fear now we have to re-check all `size_t` occurrences...

Do we run the optimizer for emscripten to check platform independence?

Ok, we do run with and without optimizer, so it seems that in practice, it seems to not mattter.
