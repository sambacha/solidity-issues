Closes #3665.

Tests are running with ``--no-ipc --no-smt``, optimizer tests are disabled. Unfortunately, SMT tests are hanging, the optimizer might be fixed with #3999. Also, the Corion compilation test is failing with an exception that I want to find the cause for.

End-to-end tests can and should be fixed at some point before 0.5.0.

What do you mean by hanging?

@axic It seems that one of the SMT tests takes either very very long to finish or it's in an infinity loop / deadlock or something like that. On my machine ``soltest`` is running, but no more output is being produced at some point. Same on Circle, but there the timeout is set to 10 minutes without any further output. That's why the test is failing in the end.

Ah right, because brew contains an older version of z3, which has that issue: #3823

Has some other issues in the test script:
```
Commandline tests successful.
pkill: Cannot compile regular expression `' (empty (sub)expression)
pgrep: Cannot compile regular expression `' (empty (sub)expression)
```

@axic The errors
```
Commandline tests successful.
pkill: Cannot compile regular expression `' (empty (sub)expression)
pgrep: Cannot compile regular expression `' (empty (sub)expression)
```
were caused by ``eth`` not running. This is now also only happening if ``$RUN_ENDTOEND_TESTS`` is true.

@bit-shift can we squash these commits?
