# [\#4006 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4006) `closed`: Properly unlink unreachable source vertices from CFG

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30412138?v=4" width="50">[lenar-safin](https://github.com/lenar-safin) opened issue at [2018-04-27 21:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4006):

This properly unlinks unreachable source vertices from CFG.

Here goes a test case as I don't see where I should place it.

```
contract UnreachableSourceVertexTest {
    event Error(string message);

    function erroneous(bool condition, string message) public payable {
        if (!condition) {
            error(message);
        }
    }

    function error(string message) public payable {
        emit Error(message);
        revert();
    }
}
```

I would also suggest splitting the `gatherKnowledge` function into two smaller ones, one for gathering information and another one for unlinking unreachable basic blocks from the CFG, because I find it strange that a function with declared "gathering" semantics does a CFG modification. But it's up to you.

 I consider this PR as ready to land and await a review.

Thanks for the pull request! Could you create a test case and put it in `test/libevmasm/Optimiser.cpp`.

Note that the control flow graph optimization is disabled in the optimizer because we cannot rely anymore on non-pushed tags to be unused. Still, it seems to be used in the structural gas estimation due to some reason.

Will do. Will do the same in #4013.

Yes, it has been disabled in e543bd34c0b4884b5a27555f698f50af6a1c0b81. #4013 is also related to the CFG optimizer.

As for me, I see three options concerning CFG optimization pass:

1. Get rid of `ControlFlowGraph` module completely and abandon the idea of CFG optimization for now.
2. Modify `ControlFlowGraph` module taking into account non-pushed tags.
3. Get rid of `ControlFlowGraph` module completely and build a new one from scratch taking into account non-pushed tags.

I could have tried to implement one of these options and to start working towards it, but I request your opinion here. Personally, I find the third option preferable.

We are not putting too much work into the optimizer at the opcode level, because we are mostly working on the new intemediate language optimizer. This one could of course also profit from more complex stages. Perhaps you would like to work on that one?

Unfortunately, some of the components of the new optimizer are still in pull requests, but a good start might be here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3846

Superseded by #4058.
