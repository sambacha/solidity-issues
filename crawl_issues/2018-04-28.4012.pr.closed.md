Fixes #3965.

@axic @chriseth 

Could I get dibs on this merge request since I started work on it initially and commented on the issue? Was pretty excited to contribute until I saw another PR open.

You first requested to work on the issue, so no worries. Please change the type of the member variable `m_bytes`, not only the constructor parameter.

Next time please do not close and open a new PR, rather do a rebase: `git rebase origin/develop`. Also it makes sense to work on a branch and not on `develop` directly to avoid confusion.
