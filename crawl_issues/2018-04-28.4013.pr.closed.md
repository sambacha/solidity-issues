# [\#4013 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4013) `closed`: Prevent knowledge gathering algorithm from state explosion

This prevents knowledge gathering algorithm from state explosion.

Here goes a test case as I don't see where I should place it.

```
contract StateExplosionTest {
    bool public fork;
    uint256 public accumulator;

    function doubleSpace(uint256 _amount) public {
        if (fork) {
            accumulator += _amount;
        } else {
            accumulator -= _amount;
        }
    }

    function explode() public {
        doubleSpace(1);
        doubleSpace(2);
        doubleSpace(3);

        // ...

        doubleSpace(998);
        doubleSpace(999);
        doubleSpace(1000);
    }
}
```

Nevermind, should do a better work here. This naive check can prevent algorithm from visiting some basic blocks.

This now ensures that CFG will be fully traversed. This of course still does not take into consideration stored function tags. Nevertheless, I consider this PR as ready to land and await a review.

Apart from this PR, I'm wordering what exactly one needs in order to implement a sound conservative CFG optimization pass.

Sorry, but I won't be able to take a look here for the next days.

Note that this is mostly unused code and thus does not have a high priority for us.

Superseded by #4058.
