# [\#4014 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4014) `closed`: [BREAKING] Throw error if function parameters (return) use default data location.

Fixes #3402 

Only warns if the contract is a library, but can be changed to all contracts if needed.
Throws Type Error for 0.5.0.

I believe the only issue left is with events. It is warning for no default data location for event parameters, which isn't correct since they are not allowed.
Is there a way to check if the parameter is in an event? @chriseth

Please add a function `isEventParameter` in `VariableDeclaration` similar to `isReturnParameter()`. It should be enough to `dynamic_cast` the `scope()` to `EventDeclaration`.

Please add a change log entry, rebase and squash some of the commits (which belong together, i.e. the test changes).

Just pushed a squashed version of commits. 
Where should this go in the change log since 0.4.24 was just released? 0.5.0?

@chase1745 yes, please put this inside the 0.5.0 section.

@chase1745 sorry for not responding earlier. This is failing test, mostly in `syntaxTests`, which means you need to `isoltest` to regenerate the expectations (since you've added the warning).

I removed checking for non 0.5.0 mode since this is now a breaking change. I also fixed the new tests to represent this and fixed other non-related tests to not use default data location so they could run as intended without receiving this new error. All isoltests are passing for me now.

Quite a few non-syntax tests are failing now since its a pretty big change. I'll be going through and fixing what I can find over the weekend.

Still working on them, there's a good number of failures because of this. There also seems to be quite a few external tests throwing errors because of this, not sure what to do about those?

@chase1745 regarding the external tests:
- please fix solc-js and create a PR
- try to fix zeppelin and create a PR against https://github.com/axic/openzeppelin-solidity (against the `solidity-050` branch)
- ignore gnosis failures for the moment

I believe I've fixed all internal tests, but I'm getting 1 weird error on the linux tests. It's happening in `SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` starting on line `11155`. I can't seem to find what the issue is, everything looks okay to me, any ideas @axic or @chriseth?

I submitted PR's for solc-js (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/228) and zeppelin against your fork (https://github.com/axic/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/5).

I also updated the documentation to reflect the changes, but I'm not sure how it sounds, so let me know if I should make changes, or if you would like to edit the documentation feel free.

@chase1745 I've retriggered the tests, but the OpenZeppelin contracts are still failing to compile in ``RBAC.sol`` with ``TypeError: Location must be specified as either "memory" or "storage" for parameters.`` Specifying the data location in ``modifier onlyRole(string roleName)`` should fix this.

@bit-shift thanks, yeah must've just missed that one in my OpenZeppelin PR, I'll fix that.

I rebased from `develop` and also moved tests to more appropriate locations. All tests should be passing once https://github.com/axic/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/8 is merged.

@bit-shift That is the the error for local variables, not related to this PR, so I didn’t change it, thought it may be better in a separate PR. Happy to change it though if you all think it’s fine for this PR.

@chase1745 Ah yeah, right :) Let's do this in another PR. This one is already pretty large.

@bit-shift  Sounds good, I’ll try to submit one this afternoon. Can you re-trigger the tests now that @axic merged in the changes to OpenZeppelin?

@chase1745 The external test is still failing (``SignatureBouncer.sol``). Here's you can run them locally:
1) Download ``soljson.js``, built on Circle in the ``build_emscripten`` step: https://21670-40892817-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/soljson.js
2) Place the file under ``[your build directory]/libsolc/soljson.js ``
3) Run ``test/externalTests.sh [your build directory]/libsolc/soljson.js `` in the root of Solidity 

Doing this will help to find breaking contracts :)

@bit-shift I found 2 parameters in that file to fix, and am almost positive that is all of them in OpenZeppelin, but running the tests the way you said, the current `solidity-050` branch passes all tests before adding in these changes. Any ideas why? I want to make sure I get all of them this time.

Sorry, this needs to be rebased now. Perhaps it would make sense to split this PR into multiple PRs:
 - one that updates the syntax tests
 - one that updates the end to end tests
 - one that updates the external tests
 - one that enforces the logic

@chriseth Submitted PR's for syntax tests (merged), external tests (#4512), and end to end tests (#4489). Once all 3 have been merged I'll submit a PR for the actual logic so it passes tests and I don't have to rebase a bunch of times.

@chase1745 can this PR be closed? I think #4518 is the last in the row superseding this  one.
