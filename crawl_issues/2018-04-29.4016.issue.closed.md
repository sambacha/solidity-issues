# [\#4016 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4016) `closed`: public function does not work in library

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30855700?v=4" width="50">[sjmini](https://github.com/sjmini) opened issue at [2018-04-29 15:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4016):

The square function in contract "IntOpsUser" fails in remix with compiler version 0.4.23 and above.
I test it with both java VM and with my private network through Web3 provider.
It works correct only if I specify "internal" keyword in library function.
Is this correct behavior? It seems that library cannot have public function. 

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

library IntOps {
  function square(int8 self) returns (int8) {
    return self*self;
  }
}

contract IntOpsUser {
  using IntOps for int8; 
  
  int8 public c = 3;

  function square(int8 a) returns (int8) {
    return c.square();
  }
}
```

The root cause seems to be a bug in remix: https://github.com/ethereum/remix/issues/783

Likely this was fixed. Please reopen if it still persists.
