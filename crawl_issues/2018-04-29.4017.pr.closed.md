This PR adds new options to the solc command line interface and standard json interface to output information on the storage layout of a compiled contract in JSON format. 

I'd really appreciate any feedback!

Fixes #3736.

### Use case

In [zeppelin_os](https://github.com/zeppelinos/) we are working on [upgradeability patterns](https://blog.zeppelinos.org/proxy-patterns/) using proxies. To make a long story short, all contract instances are actually proxies that hold the state and `DELEGATECALL` into a single contract acting as a backing implementation. To upgrade the proxy, we simply change the address of the backing implementation to a different one.

However, for two implementations to be "compatible", they **must** share the same storage layout (ie the state variables must have been assigned the same slots in both implementations). Otherwise, when the new implementation attempts to read a storage variable set from the previous one, it may end up reading an incorrect value.

Even though it is possible to infer the position of each variable by manually linearizing the inheritance chain, and assuming that the compiler will honor the ordering in which the state vars were declared, this approach is brittle and could break, should the compiler start optimizing storage layouts (for instance, in order to pack small-sized variables in a single slot). Having this information provided directly by the compiler is a much safer approach.

### Implementation

The information is already collected in [`CompilerContext#m_stateVariables`](https://github.com/spalladino/solidity/blob/storage-info/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerContext.h#L307). This PR just adds a new class `StorageInfo` that reads that information and yields a JSON array with all the relevant information:

```json
[{
  "name": "myvar",
  "contract": "Test",
  "offset": "0",
  "slot": "0",
  "type": "uint256",
  "size": "1",
  "bytes": "32"
}]
```

Note that this involves exposing the internal `m_stateVariables` field of `CompilerContext`, of type `std::map<Declaration const*, std::pair<u256, unsigned>>`, which could be considered as breaking encapsulation. If so, this could be abstracted by exposing an iterator that yields a struct containing the `VariableDeclaration`, `position`, and `offset`, that provides the same information as the map, without revealing the underlying implementation. Not sure if it would be overdesigning, so I left it as simple as possible for now.

### Interface

Adds a new `storage-layout` argument to the combined-json option of the command-line interface:

```bash
$ solc ~/Projects/zeppelin-solidity/contracts/DayLimit.sol --combined-json storage-layout  | jq .
```

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "/home/spalladino/Projects/zeppelin-solidity/contracts/DayLimit.sol:DayLimit": {
      "storage-layout": "[{\"bytes\":\"32\",\"contract\":\"DayLimit\",\"name\":\"dailyLimit\",\"offset\":\"0\",\"size\":\"1\",\"slot\":\"0\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"bytes\":\"32\",\"contract\":\"DayLimit\",\"name\":\"spentToday\",\"offset\":\"0\",\"size\":\"1\",\"slot\":\"1\",\"type\":\"uint256\"},{\"bytes\":\"32\",\"contract\":\"DayLimit\",\"name\":\"lastDay\",\"offset\":\"0\",\"size\":\"1\",\"slot\":\"2\",\"type\":\"uint256\"}]"
    }
  },
  "version": "0.4.24-develop.2018.4.29+commit.cf59d217.mod.Linux.g++"
}
```

The storage-layout info is packed as a string in the combined json, same as the ABI, natspec, or other similar attributes.

As for the JSON interface, adds a `storage` outputSelection setting:

```bash
$ echo '{"language":"Solidity","sources":{"DayLimit.sol":{"urls":["/home/spalladino/Projects/zeppelin-solidity/contracts/DayLimit.sol"]}},"settings":{"outputSelection":{"*":{"*":["storage"]}}}}' | ./build/solc/solc --standard-json --allow-paths="/home/spalladino/Projects/zeppelin-solidity/contracts" | jq .
```

```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "DayLimit.sol": {
      "DayLimit": {
        "evm": {},
        "storage": [
          {
            "bytes": "32",

            "slot": "0",
            "type": "uint256"
          },
          {
            "bytes": "32",

            "type": "uint256"
          }

Thanks for the pull request! I know this has been an often requested feature, but I have to ask the question I ask everyone talking about this: How does this extend to more complex data types?

Also concerning the use-case in zeppelin os: Wouldn't it be safer to enforce all contracts to inherit from a certain contract that only consists of the required state variables?

Thanks for the reply @chriseth!

>  How does this extend to more complex data types?

Structs are listed by their full name `contractName.structName`:
https://github.com/spalladino/solidity/blob/7dc45d82d4b0c746145168da020df37a935ab066/test/libsolidity/SolidityStorageInfoJson.cpp#L201-L218

Mappings are listed as using a single slot, but using their canonical name:
https://github.com/spalladino/solidity/blob/7dc45d82d4b0c746145168da020df37a935ab066/test/libsolidity/SolidityStorageInfoJson.cpp#L186-L199

I'll be happy to add tests for more complex data types, just let me know what you have in mind!

>  Wouldn't it be safer to enforce all contracts to inherit from a certain contract that only consists of the required state variables?

Yep, that's the approach we suggest, but if the user wants to start from scratch or modify an existing contract, we want to be able to validate that the result is compatible. Another potential issue: what happens if, as part of the upgrade, the user adds another contract to the inheritance chain (for instance, adds a [Pausable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/lifecycle/Pausable.sol) behaviour), that would inadvertently add another variable in the middle of the storage layout. 

Last but not least, we don't want to rule out a future compiler optimization that rearranges the storage to be able to better package smaller-than-256 variables (such as the scenario described [here](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/miscellaneous.html?highlight=layout#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage)). Should that happen, the same Solidity file could yield different storage layouts depending on the optimizations used during compilation. 

In other words, we want to have every check in place to catch any potential issues that may arise from storage layout incompatibilities.

Actually, I've just noticed that structs actually hide how their inner members are laid out in the storage. I'll update this PR so that info is included (most likely as a nested `storage` field with that information).

The problem with more complex data structures is that you could have mappings taking strings to structs and those structs contains arrays with mappings and so on.

Only if we assume that the compiler will preserve in storage the order in which the variables were declared. We'd also need to replicate the inheritance linearization algorithm, since this would determine the order in which each contract is visited for setting up the storage. Overall, I'd say that storage layout depends on codegen, so the AST would not be the best place to retrieve this info.

I think that guarding against such changes should be responsibility of an external tool (which would handle upgradeability overall), but such tool would need input from the compiler. That said, I'm open to other ideas on how to retrieve this information; nevertheless, this approach is quite non-invasive, as it does not require changes on the compiler itself, but merely exposes information already available.

In general, I think this is a good change. The main negative point I have about this PR is that it adds "interface burden", we need to document it and be careful about breaking changes in this new interface. The other downside is that it does not go all the way, it does not specify how mappings are encoded, arrays etc., and this is why I think that it should not be part of a static output of the compiler.

Agree, but this is also the main reason behind the PR: catching a breaking change that could otherwise go unnoticed and have dire consequences.

> The other downside is that it does not go all the way, it does not specify how mappings are encoded, arrays etc., and this is why I think that it should not be part of a static output of the compiler.

If you are referring to how storage positions are determined (ie hash of slot and key), then I agree that the info is missing, and I'm not sure how it would be feasible to expose it. On the other hand, if you are referring to outputting information on the storage layout of the values handled by arrays/mappings (such as having a `mapping(string => MyStruct)`, I have a few commits still in progress that add that information (I pushed last night the ones that added the info for structs).

Hm, actually preventing breaking changes in this area should rather be done by adding a test against that.

I've updated the implementation to correctly handle complex types (structs, mappings, and arrays) by recursively visiting their members. As an example, for a mapping:

```solidity
contract test {
  mapping(uint => uint128) m;
}
```
```json
[
  {
    "name": "m",
    "contract": "test",
    "offset": "0",
    "slot": "0",
    "type": {
      "name": "mapping(uint256 => uint128)",
      "size": "1",
      "bytes": "32",
      "key": {
        "name": "uint256",
        "size": "1",
        "bytes": "32"
      },
      "value": {
        "name": "uint128",
        "size": "1",
        "bytes": "16"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Note that all type-related info is now moved into a nested `type` object. Simple fields were also changed, for consistency:

```solidity
contract test {
  uint a;
}
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "a",
    "contract": "test",
    "offset": "0",
    "slot": "0",
    "type": {
      "name": "uint256",
      "size": "1",
      "bytes": "32"
    }
  }
]
```

So to recap the situation here.

This feature request has apparently come up a few times already (#1236, #3736), because when one tries to work with Solidity at a lower level (e.g. building static analysis tools) there is often the need to know the position in storage of state variables. It's possible to do this using the AST by C3-linearizing the inheritance graph, but some of us think this is not robust because there is a significant possibility of error and incompatibility with future changes in the compiler.

The compiler already has this knowledge, so we are proposing to expose that.

I see two arguments against merging this.

1) "Interface burden". If we can agree that this feature would contribute to a robust tooling ecosystem, I think we can agree that the trade-off is worth it. This PR is missing the documentation for the compiler option, though, but we can work on that. :slightly_smiling_face: 

2) That the information exposed in this PR doesn't reflect the storage of mappings and arrays. This is true. To fix it, I would suggest adding a version number to the storage info output by the compiler. The version would specify what algorithm is used to resolve members of mappings and arrays (given the slot of the variable and the key used), and each algorithm can be explained in the Solidity docs.

@chriseth @axic What do you think about this? We would love to help get this done and maintain the feature going forward. :slightly_smiling_face:

I'm fine with going forward with this, but we need a more detailed discussion about the format. Furthermore, tests are required that detect if there is a mismatch between the reported layout and the actual layout of the contract. Not sure how to do that, and perhaps we can also drop it if it is not possible, as the information is extracted directly from the relevant structures.

What do you think, @axic ?

@chriseth happy to discuss the JSON format anytime! I'm in the solidity gitter, feel free to ping me there and we can go through it. As for the tests, I think we could build something where we compare Solidity-based setters with the output of `getStorageAt` directed by the storage layout JSON, if you think it's worthwhile.

As discussed on the call, it would make sense to:
- insert an AST Node Id useful for looking up variables in the source (but shouldn't be used for storage comparison)
- rename the `name` field to signal it is just a user friendly name
- introduce a `kind` or `category` field to know the type of the encoding

Please also create a comprehensive documentation chapter - see the Standard JSON I/O chapter.

Also discussed:
- Add a flag indicating if a field is stored in-place or in a hashed position
- Include a global version identifier for the hashing algorithm used
- Rebase the work on top of develop

Regarding the file format, it was discussed to generate a flat structure, where `type` entries are pointers to a set of types defined afterwards. The rich type identifier could be used as identifiers for these types. This would allow representing recursive structures, and also offer a more compact format. In one of the examples above, the JSON would be sth like:

```json
{
  "hash_version": "1",
  "storage": [{
    "label": "m",
    "ast_id": 42,
    "contract": "test",

  }],

@chriseth currently on hold unfortunately, due to lack of availability on our end. We have implemented a workaround by inferring the storage layout from the AST in the meantime (which is not as reliable, but catches most cases).

I'd like to add that this feature is very important tooling for formal techniques that want to reason about EVM bytecode generated from Solidity. Most people want to read/write specifications that talk about solidity storage variables, instead of the storage locations themselves, meaning that there needs to be a robust process of translating from one to the other. Right now we have no choice but to manually map out the storage layout of the contract by reading the bytecode, which is tedious, error-prone, and can be broken by updates to `solc`.

This functionality would be super useful in writing efficient Ethereum data cache solutions! A clear map of storage locations would make it way simpler for us to update cache on new blocks, and possibly make it automatic given a contract ABI :ok_hand:

@spalladino any chance this might be continued? 🙏

@MrChico would love to, but haven't had the time to work on it for a long time already. I know @nanexcool was also interested, maybe someone from his team can tackle it...?

This PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7589 adds a basic version of this feature. It outputs the first layer of the storage layout, that is, no nested information.
