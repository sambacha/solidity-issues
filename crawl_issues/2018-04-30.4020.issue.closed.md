My reasoning is that `block.timestamp` is way more explicit in showing the intention, while `now` requires explanation: yes, `now` relates to the timestamp of the block controlled by the miner.

Warning in 0.6.x, error in 0.7.0.

Not sure about this one. If we start arguing about miners controlling blocks, we have to deprecate anything that has "transaction ordering dependence". `now + 300 days` is much easier to read than `block.timestamp + 300 days` and thus might be less confusing. We could do a survey here...

Might want to consider something in the `gasleft()` vein - maybe `timestamp()`, or `currentTime()`

I think I am still in favour of `block.timestamp` as that shows clearly where the data is coming from.

The twitter oracle preferred `block.timestamp`. I'd like to bring this up again and do it on 0.7.0.

Fine with removing `now`.
