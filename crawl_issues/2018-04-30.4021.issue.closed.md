In #4011 this came up as an issue because perhaps it is not prominently explained.

In #3741 it also came up as it could be mentioned in when discussing source maps.

I would like a lot more documentation on the source map. In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3741 you mention it is based on "sections" but in the given example, how do you map section 0 to the relevant opcodes?

The documentation at https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/miscellaneous.html#source-mappings is quite limited and does not explain how to use the "f" field, especially since I get f = 0 for every part.

Thanks!

You only get `f=1` if you use multiple source files. You might have to use internal functions from libraries in other source files or inherit from contracts in other source files to get a larger `f`.

any updates on the issue? @axic 
It would be nice to have metadata format description for all versions of Solidity, not only the latest one
