This requires compiling Solidity to a 32-bit target first.

@ekpyron is Emscripten compiling to a 32-bit target or 64-bit? Couldn't find an answer in the docs. For the wasm output 64-bit makes sense, but for the asm.js output 32-bit makes more sense (given Javascript numbers are 53 bits).

Afaik browser wasm doesn't supports 64-bit anywhere atm - and I think both the wasm and asm.js builds are 32-bits - one of the windows builds might actually be as well.

Please note that wasm32 vs. wasm64 means 32-bit or 64-bit memory addressing. The instruction set is 64-bit in both cases.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
