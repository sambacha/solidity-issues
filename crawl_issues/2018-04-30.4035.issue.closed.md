From https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/82115102:

> Improve the token class such that we can get rid of most of the assertions and we can have C++ type guarantees that some token is e.g. an assignment operator.

@chriseth is this mostly about removing the `assertDetails` for elementary types?

The class `Assignment` in the AST has a member `Token m_assigmentOperator;`. It would be nice if the C++ compiler could guarantee that it can only receive a token that is a (compound) assignment operator. But I would not say that this issue is particularly important.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
