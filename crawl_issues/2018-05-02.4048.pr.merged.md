This was requested in #2245.

I have done the following:

* Changed the `--help` text to explain what setting a high number for `--run` does.
* Broken out the optimizer sentence into a separate paragraph and added documentation for the `--run` parameter.
* In the example JSON config, I have added comments for `--runs` and changed 500 to 200 (the default).

Let me know if this is good!

Wonderful, thanks!
