From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4017 - we should add tests that would detect storage layout changes.

Tests could set some storage values and then use inline assembly to read at fixed points in storage (where we expect the changes to happen).

Tests should include:
 - (multiple) inheritance
 - constants
 - mappings
 - arrays
 - structs
 - packed data

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
