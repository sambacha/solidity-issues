One of the runs reports `Unknown compiler version - please run the configure tests and report the results` but I'm not sure where that message comes from.

that warning is from vs 2017
it is due to boost version is old
please check this thread:
 https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/93313/latest-update-breaks-compiling-with-boost.html
it mentions that this message is a warning and safe to ignore.

Another approach is to upgrade boost
