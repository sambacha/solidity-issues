1b25a528d3e4e6c86a38586ed07f4244f771a829 and 256f00f09afd9b60e2e16916dc4b9790dc661d66 could be squashed before merging. (The latter basically refactors the former.)

I could also split this PR into adding the control flow graph and using it for detecting uninitialized storage returns (at the moment it's already separate commits and separate files).

@chriseth I just pushed a commit that moves m_currentFunctionFlow and refactors CFG and ControlFlowParser around that change (I think it's indeed much cleaner now).
I also used references instead of pointers and unique pointers instead of shared pointers, which clarifies ownership and lifetime further. I think (resp. hope :)) this is the last larger change we need here.

Regarding the secondary source locations:
Yes, I wasn't sure about the "end of function" location either, I'm not sure what's the best alternative, though (the last statement before the end of the function is not really the right location either). I could instead only give secondary source locations for return statements and not for the end of the function...

``might be returned without assignment`` may be even clearer, that's true, I'll change it.

Yes, perhaps just modify the message to contain `at the end of the function` without giving a secondary source location.

I'm just wondering, is the warning message clear enough? Do people realize what happens if they return a storage pointer variable without assigning it?

Changing the error message to include "at the end of the function" won't work - it may be the case that both at a return statement *and* at the end of the function a storage pointer is left unassigned.
I could use the whole function as secondary source location for the end-of-function-case, though.

In the last commit I extracted ``ControlFlowParser`` into a separate file and renamed it to ``ControlFlowBuilder``. However, I did that largely automatically and haven't yet rechecked, that it didn't mess up code formatting at some places, but I have to stop for today.

Rebased and ready for review.
