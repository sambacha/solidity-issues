@chriseth can you have a high level look at this and the referenced issue?

@chriseth we should discuss the general motivation of this latest on Wednesday so it can be finished.

@ekpyron reworked, please review. Probably also should squash the last two commits into one.

The test failures are interesting - I think ``RationalNumberType::fixedPointType()`` may have a problem...

I think the `type_identifiers` test fails on the invalid `ufixed8x64`. Need to investigate `RationalNumberType`.

``312_leading_zero_rationals_convert`` fails, because ``RationalNumberType::fixedPointType()`` tries to create an invalid ``fixed128x52``, so something needs to be done there.
However, I'm also noticing, that ``soltest`` for some reason doesn't seem to properly report the exceptions for the failing ``solAssert``s - I'll open an issue for that and will look into it.

The bug is in `RationalNumberType::fixedPointType()`. Just trying a fix now.

Some test expectations need to updated, but in some cases the calculation seems to be off.

For example in `syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/312_leading_zero_rationals_convert.sol` it deduces:

`fixed128x52` for the literal `0.0000000000000006661338147750939242541790008544921875` (and tries to assign it to `fixed256x52`).

The `totalBits` part of the deduction is wrong, it won't fit 52 decimal digits.

The problem with the calculation is that the leading zeroes are ignores and `6661338147750939242541790008544921875` does fit into 128 bits.

Proposal to calculate `totalBits`

To determine bits needed:
```cpp
rational const absValue = abs(m_value);
// If there is no integer part, add 1 to create an integer part, so we have all of the digits used for totalBits calculation.
rational const scaledValue = (absValue + (absValue < 1 ? 1 : 0)) * pow(bigint(10), fractionalDigits);
bigint const truncatedValue = (negative ? -1 : 1) * (scaledValue.numerator() / scaledValue.denominator());
unsigned totalBits const = max(bytesRequired(truncatedValue), 1u) * 8;
```
