What happens if this is run on a release commit that is not tagged?

It builds and push to snap store a snap package with version="latest".

Done.

@elopio I think there is nothing worth merging in my MR, I'm closing this MR.

@favadi do you want to help maintaining the snap? If you have ubuntu, it's super simple and safe to smoke test the new releases. And if not, you can quickly do it on a LXD container.

@elopio I can help, it doens't look too difficult and time consuming. But I guess it should be easier for someone with both access to:
- "solc" package in snap store: to setup auto build in lauchpad
- commit right in ethereum/solidity: to setup, keep track of build.snapcraft.io build status (as the build logs are not public)

So it is ideal if someone from solidity team take over the "solc" package name in snap store and do all the setup first.

Yes, my proposal is to transfer the name to the solidity team, and for them to add a couple of contributors to maintain the snap.
