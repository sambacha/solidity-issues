Currently the ABI allows tuples to have 0 members and fixed length arrays to be at fixed 0 length.

> The following (fixed-size) array type exists:
> `<type>[M]`: a fixed-length array of `M` elements, `M >= 0`, of the given type.

and

> `(T1,T2,...,Tn)`: tuple consisting of the types `T1, â€¦, Tn`, `n >= 0`

I am not convinced it makes sense supporting these.

What are the arguments for having these?

We at least need empty statically-sized arrays, because they are needed in the definition of the encoding of dynamically-sized empty arrays, and I think the statically-sized arrays in turn use tuples for encoding (or vice-versa), so I guess we could just keep all of them for completeness.

An issue in the ethereum/wiki repo that also questions the necessity of supporting fixed length arrays of 0 members: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/issues/614

A language is not required to support the full range of types documented in the ABI specification.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
