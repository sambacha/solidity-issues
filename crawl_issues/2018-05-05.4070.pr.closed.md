Fixes #3968

Can you explain a little bit more why you think this fixes the bug? I currently cannot come up with a way a `\` can actually end up being used there.

The runtime exception occurs in `createFile(m_compiler->filesystemFriendlyName(_contract) + ".bin", m_compiler->object(_contract).toHex());` as it tries to create the file `._\A_sol_A.bin`. The filename however, should not contain any "invalid" characters such as `.`, `:`, `\` or `/`. The `filesystemFriendlyName` function is supposed to take care of these invalid characters, replacing them with `_`. While it does so for forward slash and the other invalid characters, it does not replace backslash with an underscore. So, I added that line to replace backslash as well (escaping it). I have tried running 

`solc -o . --bin .\A.sol B.sol` 

after this and it outputs without error to `__A_sol_A.bin` as it used to for 

`solc -o . --bin ./A.sol  B.sol`.

OK, I see, thanks! In that case, though, I think the frontend should properly translate the `\` into `/` in `CommandlineInterface.cpp:446`. The change you made is still valid, so I think it should stay.

Basically the question I'm asking is if you can still import files in the same directory via `import "./B.sol"` if you run `solc .\A.sol B.sol`.

Can you please add a test? If nothing else, at least one in `test/libsolidity/StandardCompiler` to check backslash support there.

Eventually it would be nice to have commandline tests too.

@chriseth  yes that works! However, it creates two separate bin files for A.sol

@axic I am working on it right now!

Sorry for the late reply, I had been busy in the last few days.

@axic the bug occurs because `solc` tries to create a file with backslash in it. None of the tests in `libsolidity` covers this as it is called from `CommandLineInterface::handleBinary`.  Should the test be whether `CompilerStack::filesystemFriendlyName` replace backslash with underscore? 

Or a command line test can be used. In the case of a command line test, should it be only for windows as backslash are not used as path separator in linux? Furthermore, it does not seem that the command line tests are written with windows in mind anyway (the compilation path in windows is different from linux and this is not reflected in the test).

@chriseth @axic Looks like @asifmallik may be waiting on your thoughts here, just FYI!

@asifmallik the easiest way is to extend `test/libsolidity/StandardCompiler`. Just add a case with with multiple files and import statements with backslashes.

Separately we may want to think about introducing tests for CLI but I don't think we have any yet.

@axic I don't think I follow. I believe the issue was not that import statements do not support backslashes as they are not supposed to, rather it was that it did not support commands with output directories separated with backslashes on windows. So, it is not possible to test this without a command line test.

Perhaps to clarify: The change proposed in this PR is good, but it does not solve the underlying issue: It should not be possible to introduce a backslash into Solidity's internal contract name system in the first place. Backslashes as directory separators should be properly translated to slashes at the commandline interface level.

On windows, the two calls `solc -o . --bin .\A.sol B.sol` and `solc -o . --bin ./A.sol B.sol.` should result in exactly the same bytecode and set of output files.

Hi @asifmallik how is this one going? Hope you are doing well ðŸ™‚

@chriseth I have added a new type `unix_friendly_path` so that backslashes are immediately replaced with forward slashes for every path input in windows. Could you check if everything is alright? Should the struct be declared and defined in the header?

@vs77bb I am doing okay, apologies for the delay.

Are you sure you need a custom class? This might be easily doable by converting from "native" to "generic" format at the right point using boost::filesystem.

So I think that this is all caused by a mixup of native and generic path format, maybe we just used generic format at a single point where native format would be better (for example where we select the output path).

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4713622?u=bb1cf70c6e33e39092cb6050fa348694ecbdb53b&v=4" width="50">[asifmallik](https://github.com/asifmallik) commented at [2018-06-26 05:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4070#issuecomment-400186509):

@chriseth I think it is definitely doable without using a custom class. However, I felt it is a cleaner way to do things if the objective is to internally represent all paths as generic. I found no way to edit a `variables_map` variable and this was the easiest way in which `program_options` could be modified while adding a new one. The alternative would have been to override the `validate` function but that would also involve adding a new class. I felt this was the cleanest way because all path program option would be stored as `unix_friendly_path` in `variables_map` which ensures which type of OS-specific bug never recurs again.

However, if we are to manually check whether it is better to use "native" or "generic" path this type of bug may occur again and moreover, I am not sure if there is a good reason to even keep using the "native" path internally, so in each case we would be calling `boost::path::generic_string` instead of `path::string`.

Do I remove the classes and go with the second approach? 

(I will be offline for a week or so as I am in the process of moving abroad)

I'm sorry, I currently don't have enough time at hand to think this through, but my feeling would be that it is cleanest to only have a thin layer where native paths are allowed and use generic paths everywhere else.

@chriseth How about simply replacing all `.string()` calls for `boost::filesystem::path` to `.generic_string()`

So yes, I think paths should be translated to generic paths as soon as possible.

@asifmallik:
```
NUM_COMMITS=`git log --oneline develop.. | wc -l`
git rebase -i HEAD~${NUM_COMMITS}
```
Now carefully read what the editor is telling you that just got fired up. You can seriously damage your history, but also cure (say: squash unnecessary commits together that belong together).
