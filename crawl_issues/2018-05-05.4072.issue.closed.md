This seems to be a proposal for a new programming language or at least a new frontend for Solidity. While this might be a very good idea, it is out of scope for this issue tracker.

Is it out of scope? You could have an issue labelled as a long-term, high-level project/program and refer to it from the projects.

Yes, it is out of scope because this would be a different project.
