# [\#4083 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4083) `merged`: [BREAKING] Allocate local variables according to their scope

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2018-05-07 11:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4083):

Implements #3672. Closes #3222.

There are two scenarios so far:

1) No `break`/`continue`. That's the simple case, local vars are allocated when declared, and freed when the execution leaves their scope.

2) `Break`. Every `break` statement inside a loop requires a different amount of `pop`s, depending on the amount of local variables declared until that point.
```
function f(bool b, bool c, bool d) public pure {
	uint x;
	for (uint i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
		uint y = 12;
		if (b) break;
		if (c) {
			uint z = 39;
			if (d) break;
			x += z;
		}
		x += y;
	}
}
```
In this example, the second `break` jumps to `tag_14`, since it requires 3 pops: `z`, `y` and `i`.
The first `break` jumps to `tag_11`, since it needs to free only `y` and `i`.
Any execution where a `break` happens, after freeing the local vars, jumps to the actual end of the loop, in this case `tag_15`.
Here we have `tag_8` as the end of the loop for executions that do not have any `break` (loop condition failure jumps here), in which case we know that the local variables are freed in the end of their scopes (as in `1`) and we only have to free loop init vars, in this case `i`.
```
   ...
    tag_14:
      pop
    tag_11:
      pop
      pop
      jump(tag_15)
    tag_8:
        /* "break.sol":135:141  uint i */
      pop
        /* "break.sol":130:273  for (uint i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {... */
    tag_15:
    ...
```

I had to comment out two stack height checks (to be adjusted manually) and two other checks such that exceptions do not occur:
libevmasm/Assembly.h:94
libevmasm/Assembly.cpp:328

I'm investigating the exceptions.

The reason for the `stack underflow` is basically the same: jumps are not taken into account in the stack height.

Missing:

- [X] Make sure `return` is working
- [x] Document properly
- [x] Modifiers

The reason why I removed the `returnTags` from after the visit of the function/modifier block is that the local variables from that block will be freed, but this shouldn't get mixed with the parameters being freed which is also necessary after the pops for local variables that a `return` does.
That's why the stack on size of the modifier parameters are summed and only freed when the function parameters are also freed.

@leonardoalt can you comment on what you want to do with the code block that is jumped to for break and continue?

The idea now is
- `break`: each break pops the local variables that were declared inside the latest loop and were not freed yet, and jumps to outside the loop. In the case of a `for` loop, the init var is **not** freed, that is done by the `forStatement` itself.
- `continue`: each continue pops the local variables that were declared inside the latest loop and were not freed yet, and jumps to the loop condition test.
- `return`: each return pops all the local variables that were declared inside the function **and** modifiers and were not freed yet, and jumps to the end of the function where the parameters of the function and modifiers are freed. This caused `m_returnTags` to contain only one tag (to be cleaned up) which is used by all `return`s. Another consequence of this is the following change: before, modifiers local vars and parameters were freed together. Now the local variables are freed either in the normal execution when the `Block` is `endVisit`ed or in a `return` statement, and the parameters are freed together with the other function and modifier parameters in the end. The reason is that the `return` pop blocks do not free the parameters and need to jump to that point.

@chriseth Simplified/reimplemented some parts using the break/continue/return tags with the stack height.

Added more tests for: nested for loops, local variables declared after break/continue, break/continue/return in modifiers with loop (there are also more complex already existing modifier tests), calldata array with break/continue and extra local variables.
