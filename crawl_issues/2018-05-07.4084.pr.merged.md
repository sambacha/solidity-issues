@chriseth
Uses inline assembly now.
I had a look at the optimized EVM assembly output and at the gas estimates. The gas estimates are identical for the assembly and the non-assembly versions and the generated code is slightly different (as one would expect), but looks fine.

Note: still to be discussed: should this be a pragma 050 change or not?

@ekpyron do you want to pull out the test cases? Those can be merged now (with the current values).

Note: Needs to be rebased once the tests in #4102 are merged into develop and develop is merged into 050.

I think we actually hadn't talked about how I emulate SAR so far - are the comments I just added clear enough to explain what's happening?

@axic @leonardoalt can you please review the shifting routines?

@chriseth Do you think the comment in ExpressionCompiler.cpp works now?

I am still fine merging this. The code can be improved/changed, if needed, at a later time.

This is in conflict now. Will rebase.
