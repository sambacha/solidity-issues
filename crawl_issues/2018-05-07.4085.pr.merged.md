# [\#4085 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4085) `merged`: [BREAKING] Properly pad data from calldata.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-05-07 20:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4085):

Fixes #3493 

Note that as soon as this is merged, it is not possible to forward bytes data anymore via call. We need #3955 for this, but that is a breaking change.

Actually #3955 can be implemented with `pragma 050`, so it might not be a big deal.

Why is #3955 needed for that and why is that breaking? Is that the right issue to link to?

`call()` performs padded encoding. This PR fixes a bug where the padding was not done for calldata byte arrays. Because of this bug, it was possible to forward call data via `x.call(msg.data)`. Once the bug is fixed, this is no longer possible. With https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3955#issuecomment-383539560 the idea is to change the `call` function so that it only accepts a single `bytes` argument which is encoded as is without padding.

Result of discussion: Add a warning for hash functions, and do the rest (including call*) with 0.5.0 proper.
