# [\#4088 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4088) `closed`: When returning structs using a public storage "variable", the abi and return data is not a "component"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/562371?u=a24692821d9708e05f0cf297f8cd81b665df41f4&v=4" width="50">[juanfranblanco](https://github.com/juanfranblanco) opened issue at [2018-05-08 10:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4088):

Given the following struct:

```solidity
struct TestStruct {
        uint256 id;
        SubStruct subStruct1;
        SubStruct subStruct2;
        string id2;
    }
```

if the struct can be accessed as:

```solidity
TestStruct public testStructStorage;
```

the ABI will be the following:

Missing the "components" section. Also when returning the data, the encoded data it is also not a "component" because the first element is not the index of the data.

```json
{
      "constant":true,
      "inputs":[

      ],
      "name":"testStructStorage",
      "outputs":[
         {
            "name":"id",
            "type":"uint256"
         },
         {
            "components":[
               {
                  "name":"id",
                  "type":"uint256"
               },
               {
                  "name":"id2",
                  "type":"string"
               }
            ],
            "name":"subStruct1",
            "type":"tuple"
         },
         {
            "components":[
               {
                  "name":"id",
                  "type":"uint256"
               },
               {
                  "name":"id2",
                  "type":"string"
               }
            ],
            "name":"subStruct2",
            "type":"tuple"
         },
         {
            "name":"id2",
            "type":"string"
         }
      ],
      "payable":false,
      "stateMutability":"view",
      "type":"function"
   },

```

But if we have a function which returns the value or a function that uses it as input
```solidity
function GetStorageStruct() public view returns (TestStruct testStruct){
        return testStructStorage;
    }
```

The abi is the following: 
```json
{
      "constant":true,
      "inputs":[

      ],
      "name":"GetStorageStruct",
      "outputs":[
         {
            "components":[
               {
                  "name":"id",
                  "type":"uint256"
               },
               {
                  "components":[
                     {
                        "name":"id",
                        "type":"uint256"
                     },
                     {
                        "components":[
                           {
                              "name":"id",
                              "type":"uint256"
                           }
                        ],
                        "name":"sub",
                        "type":"tuple"
                     },
                     {
                        "name":"id2",
                        "type":"string"
                     }
                  ],
                  "name":"subStruct1",
                  "type":"tuple"
               },
               {
                  "components":[
                     {
                        "name":"id",
                        "type":"uint256"
                     },
                     {
                        "components":[
                           {
                              "name":"id",
                              "type":"uint256"
                           }
                        ],
                        "name":"sub",
                        "type":"tuple"
                     },
                     {
                        "name":"id2",
                        "type":"string"
                     }
                  ],
                  "name":"subStruct2",
                  "type":"tuple"
               },
               {
                  "name":"id2",
                  "type":"string"
               }
            ],
            "name":"testStruct",
            "type":"tuple"
         }
      ],
      "payable":false,
      "stateMutability":"view",
      "type":"function"
   },
```
And to use it as an input or output, the first element indicates the index of the data section (32)

The accessor does not return a struct. This is something that has always worked and is just a different thing as returning structs. There are multiple reasons to keep this, although it might be confusing. Please reopen if you think it should be changed and a proposal about how to change it.
