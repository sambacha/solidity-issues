# [\#4090 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4090) `closed`: [BREAKING] Drop constant and payable from ABI.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-05-08 11:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4090):

Closes #4755.

Part of #3656.

To be discussed:
  - How to deal with breaking changes and the contracts in ``test/compilationTests/``?
  - Does it make sense to merge changes like this to the ``050`` branch at this point?

One of the reasons to create this was to see how the tests behave and start a discussion about that.
As expected, the tests involve external contracts, e.g. from truffle and the DAO, that are not yet forward compatible with changes like this, so we have to decide how to deal with this.

@ekpyron can we merge the `constant` -> `view` changes (docs, styleguide, std, test) separately on `develop`? That it not breaking.

@axic That's true - I have them in separate commits here, so I'll extract them into a separate PR shortly!

Once #4093 is merged to develop and develop is merged into 050, I'll rebase this PR.

The ViewPureChecker must be updated to be turned on for `view` (there's a 0.5.0 check there).

@axic The two last commits now enable enforcing ``view`` in ViewPureChecker. The last commit merely adjusts some end-to-end-tests and I extracted it to #4093 as well.
Actually I would have considered enabling these errors to be separate from this PR, but I guess it makes sense to add it in here.

Of course, since this last change (``ViewPureChecker`` reports errors for ``view``), the tests will fail again and are much more involved to update. Since we decided to disable the compilation tests for 0.5.0 I will not update them any further.

Rebased and removed the commit that updates ``test/compilationTests`` (since we decided to disable those tests for 0.5.0).

@chriseth Should we maybe disable the compilation tests on 050 already?

I think I now caught all errors in the in-tree compilation tests. Not sure what to do about the external tests, though.

Why are tests failing?

Do you want to merge the commit of removing `constant` from the local test quite before there's a need for too much rebasing?

@axic I think the test failure was due to some random RPC failure unrelated to this PR - I just rebased, so we'll see whether the tests fail again.
Otherwise I think it should be fine to merge it all at once, but I'll recheck, when I'm back in Berlin next week.

The remaining test failures should be due to the external compilation tests. I think we should merge #4206 - I created a PR with the required changes to the gnosis contracts here: https://github.com/axic/pm-contracts/pull/1 ; zeppelin seems to have removed ``constant`` already.

We also need to decide how to deal with ``DAO`` and ``truffle`` tests (unless I have missed a decision there).

Truffle has been fixed for all these things, but the projects using them aren't using the latest release yet. I've asked Gnosis, will check Zeppelin too.

As for the solc-js I'd prefer to create a DAO050 directory and keep the 0.4.x version intact because I'd like to run solc-js tests on different version as it should be the backwards compatibility glue.

Merged the solc-js changes and updated the `solcjsTests.sh` to use it in #4280. I think that should work, be merged, and then this PR should be close to a mergeable state.

I split this up further and extracted #4409 and #4413. What remains for this PR is the JSON ABI change, but that still breaks the openzeppelin test suite.

@axic @chriseth As far as I can tell, the external test failure is due to truffle relying on the ``constant`` field to be part of the json ABI. Not sure how to proceed (shall I look into modifying truffle? shall we open an issue at their repo? shall we keep ``constant`` in the ABI for the time being?).

There's an issue for truffle https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/1093
and a PR for web3  https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/pull/1765 now.

I just discussed with @chriseth that it may make sense to postpone this change for now - unless everything that depends on ``constant`` in the ABI is updated, it's likely to break a lot of existing javascript code - and only has very limited gain. We should still try to get external code updated, so that we may change this in the future.

This PR changes both the AST JSON and the ABI output. I think we can merge the AST JSON change, but as agreed the ABI should remain a little bit longer.

We should also submit a PR to go-ethereum's abigen and potentially parity's abigen.

Truffle 5.x was updated and they plan to backport the changes 4.x. @frozeman made web3 releases.

@yann300 @iurimatias is remix / embark making use of `stateMutability`?

@chriseth @ekpyron I think we can ~~close this now~~ postpone this now. Since I consider this a "protocol change", it doesn't necessarily needs to be aligned with breaking releases. Just the time has to be right for the ecosystem to adapt.

@axic Yes, I think we were pretty much heading towards postponing this anyways and classifying this as ``protocol change`` and decoupling those from breaking releases makes sense.
