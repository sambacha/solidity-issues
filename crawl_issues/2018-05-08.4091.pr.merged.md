# [\#4091 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4091) `merged`: [BREAKING] Disallow conversions between bytesX and uintY of different size.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-05-08 13:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4091):

Closes #3786.

This PR contains a simple, but breaking solution.
As mentioned in the issue, it may be possible to use a pragma 050 solution instead, but this would depend on #3879.

The second commit in this PR allows conversions from zero to bytesX (e.g. ``bytes32(0)``).
Since padding is irrelevant for this conversion I think it makes sense to make an exception here.

Do you agree?

In general conversions from rational numbers to bytesX types have the same problem as integer to bytesX conversions (is ``bytes32(0x1234)`` left or right aligned?), so I would disallow those as well (as is already the case in the PR).

Related to the last comment: #3942

Damn - I just noticed that this is actually a duplicate of #3899. I hadn't seen that, since the issue was still unassigned (not sure whether #3899 already referenced the issue, when I started - I might just have missed that).

I replaced the commits in this PR by a simplified version that only disallows conversions between bytesX and uintY of different size, but does not yet change the conversion between literals and bytesX types. I think it's best to handle the latter in a separate PR.

Fine to merge apart from the two issues above.
