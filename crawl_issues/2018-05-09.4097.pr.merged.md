# [\#4097 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4097) `merged`: [BREAKING] call only takes a single argument and does not pad

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-05-09 07:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4097):

Fixes #3955 
Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3978

This changes `.call()`, `sha3()` and other functions that previously took arbitrary parameters to take exactly one `bytes memory` argument which is packed encoded without padding. The `abi.*` functions are the only functions that now take arbitrary parameters.

TODO:
 - [x] check that log0 etc work correctly
 - [x] documentation
 - [x] tests
 - [x] better error message for `.call()` (suggest to change it to `call("")`)

Rebased. Still need to work on log, docs and tests.

Having to rebase this over and over gets increasingly annoying. Perhaps we can merge some part of this already now?

Turns out that `log0`, ... actually only take `bytes32` arguments and no dynamic types anyway.

Ah, forgot to add a test that checks that the hash functions and the call functions actually do not take arbitrary arguments anymore.

Seems like solc-js (the dao) and the compilationTests need to be updated to work with this.

I liked the simplified `appendExternalFunctionCall` a lot.

Weird, I though I checked the DAO.

Need to rerun the tests with a newer openzeppelin (I rebasing this PR over develop should solve it) and the DAO is still not fixed.

Rebasing this now. Can this be merged next?
