# [\#4098 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4098) `merged`: Introduce Result<T> for type checker functions

### Description
Part of #3879.

This aims to create the foundation for extended error reporting during type checks. It introduces a generic result type ``Result<T>`` that holds the actual result value and an optional error / suggestion message. 

The main goal was to create a component, that requires as little changes to the existing code as possible and thus provide implicit conversion to and implicit creation from the underlying result.

As an alternative, I was thinking about a solution using ``boost::variant``, which could look like this, but also has different semantics. I've created a working prototype for this on a separate branch, in case someone wants to have a look.
```
auto compute = [](bool const& _ok) -> Result<bool> {
	if (_ok)
		return true;
	return Err("error");
};

Result<bool> result = compute(true);
match<bool>(
	result,
	[&](bool _type) { ... },
	[&](Err _err) { ... }
);
```
Maybe this is something we want to look into at some point in the future.

We could extend Result (or rather TypeResult) with an implicit conversion to bool and an implicit conversion to TypePointer. Would that be weird or helpful?

Also, in which places could we add meaningful error messages?

@chriseth What's your expectation regarding error message handling? Currently the default error message is overwritten by the one the result returns. I think for ``binaryOperatorResult`` this is fine but I see some cases in ``isImplicitlyConvertible`` where we actually might want to append.

@bit-shift yes, I agree. We have to think about which error messages to use.

@chriseth Results are now implicitly convertible to ``bool`` and the type that they are holding. The current usage with ``bool`` and ``TypePointer`` works nicely, but there will be issues as soon as we start to use ``Result<size_t>`` or any other type where it's unclear what ``operator bool()`` should return (which is also somehow the case for ``Result<bool>``). Right now I'm thinking about making ``Result`` abstract such that it has to be implemented for each new type separately...

The use for this template should be very specific, we should not use it in places apart from isImplicitlyConvertibleTo and binaryOperatorResult.

Perhaps the templates should also be renamed, `error` should be part of the name, perhaps `TypeOrError`.

@bit-shift Did you decide against the alternative solution we were talking about a while ago?

I think this was roughly the one we discussed:
```
template<typename T, typename ErrorType = std::string>
class Result
{
public:
    Result(T _value): m_value(_value) {}
    Result(T _value, std::shared_ptr<ErrorType> _err): m_value(_value), m_err(_err) {}
    Result(T _value, ErrorType _err): m_value(_value), m_err(make_shared<ErrorType>(_err)) {}
//    Result(ErrorType _err): m_err(new ErrorType(_err)) {}

    /// dereference to get value
    T const& operator*() { return m_value; }

    /// implicit conversion to bool to check for error
    operator bool() const {
        return m_err;
    }
    ErrorType const& err() const {
        return *m_err;
    }
private:
    T m_value;
    std::shared_ptr<ErrorType> m_err;
};
```

@ekpyron I decided against it, because it doesn't work well for ``isImplicitlyConvertibleTo``. There we would need pass an error message if the actual result is ``false``. Also I think that the current solution is even simpler.

The same modifications should also be done to `isExplicitlyConvertibleTo`.

In order to assess whether this change makes sense at all, we also need to find some example error messages and check if that is helpful to the users.

Fails on spelling:
```
./libdevcore/Result.h:24: implicitely  ==> implicitly
./libdevcore/Result.h:45: emtpy  ==> empty
```

The other failures should be solved by rebasing.

@bit-shift @ekpyron @christianparpart what is left here? Can we merge it?

It's surprising how excessive one can argue about a thing like this :-). IMHO, this here is a nice option as well: https://pastebin.com/CLCs2atW (I wrote it externally as to not add any further spam here :-)).

But I also think we should stop trying to argue and optimize this to death in the first run and just merge the next best option we arrive at - we can still improve it and we urgently need better error reporting in these cases...

@ekpyron Yea, this PR got out of control ;) I decided to make a cut for now since I really want to get this merged. I pulled out our ideas and created a separate branch that we can use to assess further improvements (as you already suggested). And also consider the snippet you've posted.

I agree that we should just disregard some of the details here and get this merged rather sooner than later.
Although there is one thing that should be fixed in my opinion before this can be merged: "undefined behaviour" is unacceptable. The class should have a clear state about whether it is an error or whether it is a value. It should not be possible to ignore an error by mis-using this class.

We should focus on the two specific instances of this template we have: bool and TypePointer. Both have a default value (although bool is a bit special here, it might be in undefined state because it is a POD) which signals "error". This behaviour should be checked and built-in into this class.

Currently, it is possible to use `Result<bool>::Ok(false)` which contradicts the above assumptions - the fact that the value is "Ok" is not stored anywhere in the class.

I would propose to just remove the factory functions. We could keep the `Error(std::string)` factory function, but in that case, I would implement it as
`static Result<ResultType> Err(std::string _error) { return Result(ResultType{}, std::move(_error)); }`
so that the `ResultType` is required to be default-constructible with the implied meaning that default-constructed equals failure.

Also, what is the purpose of the ResultError struct? Why can't we just have the implicit	`Result(ResultType _value)`-constructor, an implicit `Result(std::string _error)`-constructor (that also default-constructs the result value) and a *private* explicit `Result(ResultType _value, std::string _error)` - constructor (note that this one needs to be private because it allows to construct non-default-constructed values in combination with an error string)?

So as a summary: Remove the possibility to create instances of this class with a non-default-constructed value and an error string.
