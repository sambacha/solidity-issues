This suggests that `pure` prevents reading from state.

> Before version 0.4.17 the compiler didn’t enforce that pure is not reading the state.

This suggests that doing so is impossible. 

> It is not possible to prevent functions from reading the state at the level of the EVM

Am I reading that right?

The first comment is about the EVM, the second is about the compiler. I think we should clarify that the first comment concerns non-circumventable runtime checks done by the EVM itself and the second only concerns compile-time type checks, which can be circumvented.

Thanks. How would one circumvent a compile time check? I suppose that would have to be done by a message call to another contract, otherwise couldn't the compiler verify that no state mutating opcodes are included?

You can circumvent compile-time checks by doing invalid explicit conversions between contract types. The compiler can verify that the type of the contract does not do state-changing operations, but it cannot check that the contract that will be called at runtime is actually of that type.

This issue is just about improve that warnings in the documentation, right?
