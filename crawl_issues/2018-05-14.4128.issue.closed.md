**Labels**: `good first issue candidate`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

`binaryOperatorResult` and `isImplicitlyConvertible` currently only return few error messages.

The purpose of this issue is to collect cases that can be improved.

Two good starting points are: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/search?q=not+compatible and https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/search?q=not+convertible

---------
Work done so far:

`binaryOperatorResult`

 * [x] For AddressType: "Arithmetic operations on addresses are not supported. Convert to integer first before using them." (#3879)
* [x] For IntegerType: "Exponentiation is not allowed for signed integer types." (#3879)
* [x] For RationalNumberType: "Precision of rational constants is limited to 4096 bits." (#3879)

`isImplicitlyCovertibleTo`

* [x] For rational literals that overflow target type: "Literal is too large to fit in [type]." (#6236)
* [x] For signed rational literals that are to be converted to unsigned types: "Cannot implicitly convert signed literal to unsigned type." (#6236)
* [x] For fixed point types that have too many fractional digits: "Too many fractional digits." (#6236)

--------
Pending cases

`binaryOperatorResult`

* [ ] ...

`isImplicitlyCovertibleTo`

* [ ] ...

```
int a;
a = 4 ** 4 ** 2 ** 4 ** 4 ** 4 ** 4;
```
Result: ``Operator ** not compatible with types int_const 1797...(301 digits omitted)...7216 and int_const 4``

Suggested error: ``Resulting number exceeds precision of 4096 bit.``

What are places in the code where the condition for type conversion might be non-intuitive? Most of the forbidden type conversions are straightforward I guess.

@chriseth Yes, in the compiler they are straightforward. I was under the impression that these improvements should rather help users to better understand why their code doesn't compile. And, of course, to validate if we even need ethereum/solidity#3879.

I meant straightforward for the users.

Could you incorporate @meowingtwurtle's suggestions into a new PR? Yeah, I guess it does make sense after all to have #3879.

#4696 is another case that would have highly benefited from this.

Is this actually done? Shouldn't we add more messages?

Well, at least the ones listed here are added. But there is probably room for more, yes. Maybe a new ticket would be better for that though?

I think the initial description is still clear, so I'll re-open.

I very much disagree. For me it was a total mess to understand the current state of the ticket. I updated the initial comment now to provide a clear overview and status.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
