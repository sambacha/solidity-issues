# [\#4129 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4129) `merged`: [BREAKING] Fix continue inside do-while.

Closes #4121.

Note: this is a dangerous change, since it silently alters behaviour of existing code!

Note: If #4057 is merged before this PR, resp. before 0.5.0, then the control flow graph for ``do...while`` statements has to be adjusted here as well.

The static analyzer? Did you mean the control flow graph? I changed that one, but I wouldn't see what needs changing in the static analyzer.

Yes, the control flow graph. Sorry for the confusion, the control flow graph is a static analysis component but of course distinct from the specific static analysis module we have.

I think the test failure is an IPC issue unrelated to this PR - It seems I don't have permission to re-trigger tests on circleci, though?
