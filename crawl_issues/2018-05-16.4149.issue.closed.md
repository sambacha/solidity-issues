It would make sense for the Remix static analyzer to suggest the minimum compiler version needed after considering all the language features used in the source code.

It should suggest the proper version pragma or complain in the version pragma present states an earlier version.

@axic Sounds good, can you provide me with a list of features introduced in each compiler version?

@soad003 sure, give me a bit of time, I have a collection of these, but need to update them.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
