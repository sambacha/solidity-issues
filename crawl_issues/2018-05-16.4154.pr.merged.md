# [\#4154 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4154) `merged`: Fix 3 warnings for gcc8.1, altered `install_deps.sh` for Arch Linux

This pull request basically addresses the [Issue](https://gitter.im/ethereum/topics/topic/5afc4eb58c24fe61eaed3fa9/tiny-bug-in-install_deps-script-arch-linux-build-from-source) I mentioned in the gitter channel.

1. `install_deps.sh`
    - "Arch Linux" was not recognized as the Arch distribution. 
    - Removed a dependency that does not exist
        - I could not find a  `pacman` dependency called `ethereum-git; if I didn't miss anything, it does neither exist in the official repo, nor in the AUR.
    - added optional dependencies
2. Fixed 3 gcc warnings (that are considered errors like the `-Werror` flag is used, preventing me from `making` the project).

edit:
I queried for the packet ethereum-git in the AUR and found 
```bash
> yaourt -Ss ethereum-git
aur/cpp-ethereum-git r31888.04e8ca5af-1 (0) (0.00)
    Ethereum C++ client
```
which installs from the https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum project.
If that's the required packet, it might be easiest to compile it from source inside the script / install `yaourt` and issue a yaourt -S.


Btw:
```bash
> gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 8.1.0

Can you please split them up into different commits? One for install deps, one for the exception catching and one for the `u256` conversion.
