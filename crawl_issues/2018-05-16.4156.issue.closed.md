# [\#4156 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4156) `closed`: Bad identifier suggestion in certain cases
**Labels**: `good first issue`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`, `easy difficulty`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-05-16 21:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4156):

In the following:

```
contract c {
    function c ()
    {
        a = foo.bar;
    }
    uint256 a;
}
```

instead of `foo` the compiler suggests `now`:

```
contract c {
^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
bad_suggestion.sol:4:13: Error: Undeclared identifier. Did you mean "now"?
        a = foo.bar;
            ^-^
```

(This actually is in a test: `SolidityParser/enum_valid_declaration`)

Another example from @leonardoalt:

Code:
```
contract c {
    function f() external {}
    function g() public { f(); }
}
```

Current  error message: `Undeclared identifier. Did you mean "f"?`

It should suggest the use of `this.f`.

Another find from @chriseth:

```
    pragma experimental "v0.5.0";
    contract test {
        function f() pure public {
            uint a = a;
        }
    }
```
produces ` Undeclared identifier. Did you mean "a"?`

@chriseth  and @axic I would like to take this issue if possible.
The new version of the compiler has different messages for the second and third cases as shown below.

```
contract c {
    function f() external {}
    function g() public { f(); }
}
```
gives now `Undeclared identifier. "f" is not (or not yet) visible at this point.`  should be updated to `Undeclared identifier ."f" did you mean "this.f()"`

```
    contract test {
        function f() pure public {
            uint a = a;
        }
    }
```
gives now `Error: Undeclared identifier. "a" is not (or not yet) visible at this point.`  this message should be updated to something else?

@mestorlx I would suggest to first solve the first part of the message. Currently, we look through all identifiers that match the requested one for up to two changes. This of course does not make sense if the identifer itself only has 3 characters. Perhaps adjust this to take the length of the identifier into account: 1: no search, 2-3: at most one change, 4-: at most two changes

Please review their action plans below:


**1) [mestorlx](https://gitcoin.co/profile/mestorlx) has been approved to start work.**

I will approach this problem as follows:
1- develop some algorithms to clean the data (matlab/python)
2- Discuss algorithms with funder and improve design if required.
3- Write test for the filter and discuss with funder.
4- Once algorithms and test are approved by the funder the code required to pass the test will be written.
5- Write documentation.

@chriseth Is this issue no longer needed? Would you like us to close the Gitcoin issue?

@PixelantDesign it was solved in the PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5208 so I think the bounty should be paid out.
