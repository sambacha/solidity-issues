Left a couple of tests in `SolidityParser.cpp`, which had different errors (`TypeError` or `DeclarationError`), but did fix a couple of them during the transition.

Added back the comment, but I think it is not needed there. I did manually verify the test cases (the proper ones removed and proper expectations, compared to the old version, but any extra eyes are welcome.

@axic Looks good to me. I counted 52 tests that have been removed and 54 that have been added, so I guess there're all covered ;)
The only thing that caught my attention is that a lot of the tests have redundant expectations, e.g. ``No visibility specified. Defaulting to "public".`` I'm wondering if we should adjust the contracts under test such that the amount of redundant warnings is reduced and then explicitly checked in dedicated tests. But I think this can also be part of a separate discussion.

I would say we should merge this first and then update the tests to 0.5.0 syntax, i.e. add public and stuff. Of course only if that is not the issue under test.

Yes, that would be the best approach, these are only moving test cases (mostly) verbatim, 0.5.0 fixes should be applied after.
