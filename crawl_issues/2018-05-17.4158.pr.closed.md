I ran a few tests with `uint8` (to check what the behavior is with small types), and the gas increase varies between 7% and 21%. As can be seen in the code, the only thing the function does is sums, so naturally a considerable % of gas goes to that.

```
contract C
{
    uint8 x;
    uint8 y;                 
    function f(uint8 a) public {
        x = a + 2;             
        y = a + 3;
    }
} 
```
```
contract C
{                
    function f(uint8 a) public {
        uint8 x;
        uint8 y;
        x = a + 2;             
        y = a + 3;
    }
} 
```

@leonardoalt what is the plan with this PR?

The plan was to test the increase in gas. But it still needs more experiments.
