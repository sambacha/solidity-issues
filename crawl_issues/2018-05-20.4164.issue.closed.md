First, I use remix-ide.

I want to 'ETC contract function' call that send coins to multiple addresses.

And, this code is below.

I wanted to call 'send_to_N' function.

And, I tested my ETC contract source in testnet.

this function call was success.

But, in mainnet, this function call was failed.

I can't know the cause of failure.

For the cause, I attempted to call "eth.getTransactionRecipt" -> I got some information but, I can't get information I want.

transaction failed log is below link.

If not, you have to compile with `--evm-version homestead`
