# [\#4166 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4166) `merged`: Fix the Heisenbug

Fixes #3718 

I tried adding customized move assignment operator and copy assignment operator to GasConsumption and ASTNode with no luck. However, I am able to fix the issue by assigning the result of breakToStatementLevel to a local variable, then assign it back to gasCosts.

Let me know if this is enough

Oh wow! Are you sure this is the only place? We should have many more uses of the move assignment operator for maps, and actually this should not even use the move assignment operator but rather return value optimization.

I tested the change using `--ast`, `--ast-json` and `--ast-compact-json` option. And segmentation faults are gone. Are we looking for solving the problem for just these three options? Or are we trying to fix all the miss uses of map assignment? I probably won't be able to solve the later, since Im not very familiar with the code base.

The thing is that I don't see the slightest problem with the previous version of the code. If this is a workaround, we should evaluate why it works and what it works around.

What is special about this function is that it is static and uses lambda functions that capture the variable to be returned, but I don't see why this should be a problem.

If you add a comment, we can take this PR as fixing the problem, because it is an improvement at very low cost.

I added some comments. Agree on root causing. I am also wondering why it fixes it too. Thinking if @wjmelements who reports the problem or someone else who is able to reproduce could verify the fix on his end?

@alibabe ok, please revert, but add comments documenting our findings (the ifdef statement for example would already be enough).

> However we could still figure out the reason this move operator fails, because move operators are used extensively in the code and I wonder if it fails in other places too or the data structure returned here has a particular reason for breaking the broken libc.

I would also stress part of the comment ^^

Is only this exact `move` operator failing or are there are other cases? If only this one, why? Does it have an unusual construct?

I reverted the latest commit. Will try to spend some time to see if I can answer @axic's question.

So `std::map` is the culprit. See code here: https://gist.github.com/alibabe/cfe2b99a935f9c3f82fd6e71bcb03d58

If I run `testMoveU256 `, no issue.
If I run `testMoveGas`, no issue.
If I run `testMap` or `testMoveU256Map` or `testMoveGasMap` all seg fault at move assignment. 

This could be related to: https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30449

edit: Its the std::map that's having issue, not `u256` @wjmelements

u256 is boost::multiprecision::number<boost::multiprecision::cpp_int_backend<256, 256, boost::multiprecision::unsigned_magnitude, boost::multiprecision::unchecked, void>>.

Could you please check if #4473 fixes the heisenbug?

@chriseth tried #4473 with no luck. Still got segmentation fault. 

Given my gist link above, now im pretty convinced that it's the `std::map`'s problem. @wjmelements ru still able to reproduce the issue? Can you help verify?

From what I can tell this is a Boost problem, and that the fix is to fix the u256 move constructor rather than to ensure we don't use the u256 move constructor anywhere.

@wjmelements I agree that we should try to fix the root of the problem but are you sure it is a boost issue instead of a stdlib issue? @alibabe which boost version do you use?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38821330?u=549238e7cf84a8aa4dc0ff95948953e9036cc767&v=4" width="50">[alibabe](https://github.com/alibabe) commented at [2018-07-13 05:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4166#issuecomment-404730403):

Im using Boost 1.66 
@wjmelements how you know its u256? I tried just move on u256 without seg fault

```
void testMoveU256() {
    u256 a = 1;

    std::cout<< "testMoveU256()" << std::endl;
    u256 b = std::move(a);
    std::cout << b << std::endl;
}
```

I'm pretty sure it is a combination of `std::map` and perhaps `u265`.

@chriseth 
Here is another reproduce where u256 is not used -  [llvm bug report](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30449). 
```
struct alignas(16) Foo { int val; };
void testMap() {
    std::map<int, Foo> m;
    std::map<int, Foo> n{{1,{1}}};
    std::cout << "GOT HERE" << std::endl;
    m = std::move(n);  //  segfault happens here
    std::cout << "GOT HERE TOO" << std::endl;
}
```

Oh wow, thanks a lot! This might indeed be the root problem. u256 could likely use alignment specifiers.

Ok, we now know where this is coming from, so I think we should just merge it. If it turns out to be a performance killer, we can add a switch.
