# [\#4173 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4173) `merged`: Allow data location suffix for internal elementary type parsing

This is basically a generalization of #3831 

Motivation:
I would like to define some special `FunctionType` for compiler's internal usage, but I found we cannot append " calldata" to reference types to make its storage location `CallData`.

Besides allow " calldata" to be appended, this patch also allows appending " storage" to reference types (to make the storage location more explicit)

Perhaps we should promote `calldata` to a location specifier in general, to allow explicit mention of location specifiers in `external` functions.
