# [\#4176 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4176) `merged`: Add a new keyword, "calldata", to allow explicitly specify data location in external function's argument list

As mentioned in #4173 
Maybe this should be merged into `0.5.0` branch?

The test cases (apart from `calldata`) cold also be merged straight away.

It seems `050` have just been merged into `develop`. Do I still need to open another PR for the non-backward compatible change?

I think we should be fine not splitting it. Can you please rebase it?

Ok. `calldata` added to `docs/grammar.txt` (are there other files I should change?). Rebased against `develop`.

Sorry, it also needs a changelog entry :)

Hmm.. Looks like the tests run on circleci have some random failure? I only changed Changelog.md, which should not make it became failed.
