# [\#4181 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4181) `merged`: Supply git as a dependency for building in docker

Otherwise, the build will fail complaining about not nowing a commit
hash to label the version with.

CMake should actually take care of this during the build process. The file `commit_hash.txt` is only needed if there is no git or no `.git` directory. Perhaps the docker file does not properly specify `git` as a requirement? Note that this script worked for me one week ago. It might be that I have stale docker images, though.

`install_deps.sh` installs `build-base` for alpine - does this include git?

It apparently does not, as adding `git status` after `./scripts/install_deps.sh` results in `/bin/sh: git: not found`

Reverted the `docker_build.sh` changes and instead changed `install_deps.sh`. Let me know if you would prefer the commits to be squashed.

Yes, please squash.
