There is need an explanation why we are doing 16 elements "Access to the stack is limited to the top end in the following way: It is possible to copy one of the topmost 16 elements to the top of the stack or swap the topmost element with one of the 16 elements below it."

Still, you can only access the 16 topmost stack elements unless you move them somewhere else. Where do you think this explanation is needed?

Question was why we are limiting to 16 elements only? Any specific reason on it?

The solidity documentation cannot provide a historical explanation of design decisions for the EVM.
