I want to verify that a string only contains valid utf-8. according to [here](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/issues/1610) solidity accepts invalid UTF-8 chars by default.

Thanks for opening this issue, but this question is better asked at https://ethereum.stackexchange.com - you will get faster and better replies there.
