@chriseth @vs77bb let me know what you think. Is it good/bad? Too little/much? Should I add some other examples?

@biboran I think the size is perfect. I haven't reviewed it in full, but I thought that it might be better to do it inside-out. As it is currently, the offset numbers just appear from nowhere and you actually state that the data can be moved around. What do you think?

@chriseth good idea. Do you know if [readthedocs.io](url) supports any kind of color coding? I skimmed through cheatsheets and official specification but didn't find anything.

I don't think using explicit colors is a good idea because readthedocs has several different rendering targets including pdf.

@chriseth take a look at the updated version please; I tried to rewrite the example with a more derivative narrative.

@vs77bb Hi! I am still working on it. May I have the end of this weekend as a deadline?
