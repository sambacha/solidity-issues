Hand compared the extracted expectations with the original ones. I do not want to do that again :)

However, there seems to be a non-determinism bug (it seems to be in ViewPureChecker). Some test cases report two warnings in different order sometimes.

This is one of the affected tests:
```
syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/055_inheritance_diamond_basic.sol: FAIL
  Contract:
    contract root { function rootFunction() public {} }
    contract inter1 is root { function f() public {} }
    contract inter2 is root { function f() public {} }
    contract derived is root, inter2, inter1 {
        function g() public { f(); rootFunction(); }
    }

  Expected result:
    Warning: (16-49): Function state mutability can be restricted to pure
    Warning: (129-151): Function state mutability can be restricted to pure
  Obtained result:
    Warning: (129-151): Function state mutability can be restricted to pure
    Warning: (16-49): Function state mutability can be restricted to pure

```

I haven't fully reviewed this, but I'm still fine to merge it.

The tests fail due to expectations depending on the VM version. Is this fixable in the isoltest framework?

This is hopefully the final fix now.

Appveyor is green apart from the know problem and bytecode comparison push.

> Move "create2_as_variable" back to non-isoltest tests.

Ah I was sure I kept all of those in the C++ file, but seems like missed this one.

The code did not show that it depended on the EVM version and the error message was shortened (those only perform a partial match).
