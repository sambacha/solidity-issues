# [\#4211 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4211) `closed`: Update "Safe Remote Payments" example with non-truncating division

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1874062?u=331fe061ffdf6ae3d80621ae42aec3533f5d7ae1&v=4" width="50">[kronosapiens](https://github.com/kronosapiens) opened issue at [2018-05-31 07:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4211):

The "Safe Remote Payments" example in the solidity tutorial (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.4.24/docs/solidity-by-example.rst) assumes truncating division.

As division is no longer truncating, this example should probably be updated.

Why do you think division is no longer truncating?

I was referring to the note here: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/types.html#rational-and-integer-literals

```
Division on integer literals used to truncate in earlier versions, but it will now convert into a rational number, i.e. 5 / 2 is not equal to 2, but to 2.5.
```

I was confusing the handling of integer literals with `uint`-valued variables. It's a non-issue.
