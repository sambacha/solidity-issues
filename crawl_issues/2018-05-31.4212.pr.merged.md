Thanks for the pull request! I Have not yet looked into it in detail, but some remarks that will also help in the review process:

 - please split long lines, it makes it much easier to comment on specific parts of a paragraph
 - note that all code in the documentation is compiled during the CI run, so please either create full contracts or  - there is some way to mark it but I cannot look it up right now, sorry.

hey @chriseth, i don't know what is better here, write the full contracts or mark the pieces of code to not be compiled? what do you think about?

i'm going to write the full contracts and use the comments to explain what the code does and it importance

Not sure what went wrong here. Tests are fine locally, so I will force-merge.
