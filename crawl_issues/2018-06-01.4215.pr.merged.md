Sorry I forgot to assign the issue to myself, but did mention the last call I started this work. Anyway it is not a big amount of duplicate effort :)

However we should only merge this after #4208

@axic Oh sorry, did not get this in the last call. We should try to keep the project board up to date ;) 
So, should we use with this branch / PR?

I agree, let's merge the other PR first.

@christianparpart I removed the expected shadowing warning of ``override_constructor.sol`` and ``constructor_old.sol``. The old version of ``override_constructor.sol`` was basically testing that you can have a function that is called like the constructor of a contracts base contract. Since this construct is not possible anymore, we also should not warn anymore.
And getting the warning if `` contract A { function A() public {} }``  feels a little bit like clutter.

This could be fixed without the external tests:
```
ASSERTION FAILURE:
- file   : SolidityABIJSON.cpp
- line   : 49
- message: Parsing contract failed
```

Also syntax test expectations need to be updated.

solc-js needs to be updated (thedao code). Also please try to update gnosis first (using their `development` branch), but if it seems to be too much work we can disable it.

Also needs a rebase.

I thought gnosis was not worth keeping because of truffle versioning problems?

Gnosis has two branches, `master` and `development`, the latter uses the new truffle, that should be close to working.

@axic Does that mean that we're not going use your Gnosis fork for now? I've been checking out their ``development`` branch, but it also needs an update.

@axic Regarding documentation: a lot of it was already updated with PR #3635, but I will read through the important sections again.

> Does that mean that we're not going use your Gnosis fork for now? I've been checking out their development branch, but it also needs an update.

You can push their dev branch to our fork's `solidity-050` branch. And we can take it from there :)

@axic We only have an issue with Truffle left, since the version used by ``npm`` (4.1.11) fails while testing the contracts that are been delivered with it. Do you have any information on how their updating schedule looks like? I would probably create a PR that upadates the contracts in https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/tree/develop/packages/truffle-core/lib/testing, but don't let it block this one.

TODO:
- [ ] Switch back ``solc-js`` and Gnosis repositories in ``externalTests.sh`` after ethereum/solc-js#225 and axic/pm-contracts#2 got merged.

@bit-shift to avoid a lot of rebasing work while this is still pending, we could merge updating our local test suite to use `constructor` in a separate PR right now?

@axic After 2 unsuccessful attempts to disable the failing Truffle tests, I decided to remove the Gnosis repository from our external tests for now. I will create an issue to remind ourselves to re-add them after the next Truffle release (which will hopefully contain the changes from the PR that I'm going to create within the next days.) I forked and changed the contract that's breaking the test already: https://github.com/bit-shift/truffle/tree/updateConstructor

@bit-shift can you open a PR on truffle? They should be quick enough to merge.

Also see my patch in #3534 in the `externalTests.sh` to change truffle. This could be added that way.

Sorry, but this is just gigantic. Could you try to extract updating the external files into a separate PR first? Then we can focus on the semantics changes.

@chriseth I pulled out all updates to the external compilation tests into a separate PR: #4350, but this one is still huge. I could also extract the tests in ``test/libsolidity`` since it's just the syntax that's been updated in these files and I'd like to keep the actual semantic change and the syntax tests as part of one PR.
