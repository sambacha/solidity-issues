# [\#4221 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4221) `closed`: jsoncpp: Force install libdir in jsoncpp external project

Instead of guessing the install dir for libraries decided by GNUInstalDirs module (what changes with OS and CMake version) force jsoncpp to always use "lib".

With the other PR merged, this leaves the `/usr` change. It looks a little weird to have it here, and I actually think that we should just run the develop ppa build regularly instead of changing the libdir here, but I also don't have a very deep insight into what the change actually does :)

Yes, it triggers the GNUInstallDirs spacial case: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/GNUInstallDirs.html#special-cases (the same as PPA build does).
