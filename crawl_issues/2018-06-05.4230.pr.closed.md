# [\#4230 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4230) `closed`: [WIP] Constructor keyword for version 0.5.0

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-06-05 12:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4230):

This is removing the old behaviour of how contructors are declared and introduces the constructor keyword instead.

one test is failing though, which I'd appreciate feedback for.

Can this be combined with #4215?

@axic yes it can. this PR exists for feedback on how to tackle this one particular issue (i.e. requesting for suggestions). OTOH, @chriseth told me also, that this check might valid anymore. The check failing is:

```
syntaxTests/constructor/overriding_constructor.sol: FAIL
  Contract:
    // It is fine to "override" constructor of a base class since it is invisible
    contract A { constructor() public { } }
    contract B is A { constructor() public { } }

  Expected result:
    Warning: (135-178): This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
  Obtained result:
    Success
```

I struggle finding both ctors in `B` (`B.constructor` and its inherited `A.constructor`) the way the check was coded before (`NameAndTypeResolver.cpp` in function `registerDeclaration(...)`).

@axic Eric will merge my work into his PR soon (we're in communication).

This PR can probably be closed since we combined it with PR #4215. @christianparpart Please see my comment on the other PR regarding ``overriding_constructor.sol`` :) I think it should not report a warning anymore.
