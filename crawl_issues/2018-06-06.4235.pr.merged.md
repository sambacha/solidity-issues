# [\#4235 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4235) `merged`: Fix cmake when custom CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR is given

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2018-06-06 06:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4235):

According to [cmake doc](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.11/module/GNUInstallDirs.html), we cannot assume `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` is a relative path. People often use `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/some/custome/library/path` to specify where the libraries should install to. 

Simply use `lib` as temporary libdir is probably a solution.

Inconsistent `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` problem addressed by @aarlt and @chriseth ( https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3467#issuecomment-364265583 ) is fixed by passing `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib` to jsoncpp's cmake.

We don't need `GNUInstallDirs` here because jsoncpp's build is only temporary used anyway.

@chfast could you take a look? Thanks so much

Yes, this is good solution. Exactly the same I proposed 2 days ago in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4221.
