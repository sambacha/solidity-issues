# [\#4238 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4238) `closed`: Assembly functions on that docs page are truncated
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

There's a style called .wy-nav-content that is causing the Assembly explanations table to truncate at 800px, so you can't read the function blurbs unless you go into the browser debugger and turn off the max-width: 800px style attribute:

http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/assembly.html

However, even with that attribute turned off, the really long explanations still truncate.  It would be better to adjust the styles on that page so the function explanation text wraps and doesn't get hidden if it overflows.

I can scroll the table to the right without any CSS changed, but I agree it would be nicer to have the description to wrap into multiple lines. Are you able to scroll the table with a mouse?

@axic No, I don't see any scroll bars on that page.

@roschler If I understand here we are talking styles which I am able to scroll up & down. Will you be please, more specific how you want to see it?

@aj07 That's the thing.  I just want to be able to see all of it.  Right now, long explanations are truncated at the right edge.  Instead they should wrap.

Note that the style used for readthedocs is slightly different than the one used by `make html` locally.
