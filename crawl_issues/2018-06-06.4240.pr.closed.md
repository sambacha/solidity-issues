Follow up of #4208.

Used the following to rename:
```
for i in `ls -1 *.sol` ; do mv $i `echo $i | sed 's/[0-9]*_//'` ; done
```

Are we sure we want that? If the purpose of some tests is only apparent in proximity to other tests, this information might be lost.

I think we said to remove the indexes and then order them into subdirectories, but probably it makes sense to move it into directories before removing indexes?

I am fine closing this.
