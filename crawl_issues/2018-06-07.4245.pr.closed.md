Closes #4223.

Encoding and decoding of arguments and results is still a mess, although it should already be functional for many cases.

Still missing (among others):
- ``DEPLOY`` command, resp. supplying arguments and sending ether to constructors.
- instantiating libraries

Edit: ``DEPLOY`` and libraries are added now.

Suggestions: keep comments.
Edit: Done. At least for comments (starting with ``#``, which can be discussed) at the end of call lines or result lines (i.e. no full line comments yet).

The currently last two commits depend on (and include) #4305 and will make the tests fail until ``cpp-ethereum`` is updated.

Note: so far there is no way to extract tests for which the expectation is that contract deployment fails.

To be clear about the state of this PR I added ``[TO BE REDONE]`` to the title. I'd keep the code for now, but this PR was hacky and meant to be a half-way solution to extract the tests fast - it should be redone "properly" now.

Closing this because it's being redone by me on a different branch. I will open a PR soon.
