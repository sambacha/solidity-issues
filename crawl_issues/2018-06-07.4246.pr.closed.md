Seems like the web3 dependency they use is broken:

@AntonioJuliano @BrendanChou would you be interested in having dydx contracts be compiled & tested against with each Solidity change? If so, would you commit to keeping `master` in a working (non-breaking) state? Or is this too early?

@axic 

We actually had this problem at one point with CircleCI and the web3 npm package. Not exactly sure what's wrong, but breaking the CircleCI cache seemed to work (using a new cache).

@BrendanChou it does seem to work now, however uses old syntax. `pure`/`view` has been out for ~10 0.4.x releases, do you want to upgrade your codebase?

Sorry, I see it is an upstream imported contract, but still, the problem is there.

Such is the nature of using Open-Zeppelin libraries. Thanks for your patience. They just released an updated npm package 2 days ago to fix that problem. I'll update and let you know when we made the change on master

@axic the specific problem is now fixed and I tried to verify by hand that there are no other problems by following the changelist. Is there some way for me to run some linter/compiler for v0.5.0 rather than having you keep retrying by pulling our master?

I think with truffle 4.x it is hard, but truffle 5.x has an option to select a solc version at runtime and there you could use one of the latest 0.4.25 nightly, which is the current "0.5.0".

Sorry for the dumb question, but how do you get truffle 5.x? The npm version at least seems to be at 4.1.13.

@axic Thanks! Finally got Truffle5 with the nightly solc up and running locally. It seems to throw no more errors if you want to try pulling our master again!

(although there is one warning for an open-zeppelin contract that we use)

What is the warning? Can you submit a fix to zeppelin?

@axic This seems to be a bug with either web3 or node/npm getting things directly from GitHub. I have now added `websocket` explicitly into our `package.json` if you want to try again.

If that still fails, upgrading node or npm might work, but I'm not sure

It is weird if you had to submit to Zeppelin as we keep them updated, since we run it in the CI.

I wonder how it was triggered and it is not triggered in the regular tests. We just git clone their master and run `npm run test` within.

Oh right, we have a fork (but submit all our changes) to speed up our merge process. It is a good trigger that we should update our fork now 😉

I don't think this has a chance of succeeding. We can re-add it when 0.5.0 has stabilized.
