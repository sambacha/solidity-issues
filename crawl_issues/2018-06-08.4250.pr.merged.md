On https://www.appveyor.com/docs/lang/cpp/, see ``call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86_amd64`` - maybe in these ``vcvars`` there's something we can use to deduce the current MSVC version? Also: Maybe we can merge bumping the MSVC version manually right away, so that the tests start working again, but keep the issue open until the script doesn't depend on the MSVC version anymore.

@ekpyron Yes, let's merge this right away. I removed the last commits, so the builds and the release packaging should work. ``vcvars`` do look promising, also some batch scripting magic might help ðŸ˜‰

This is working now. Both failed with the bytecodecompare github push, but otherwise compiling.
