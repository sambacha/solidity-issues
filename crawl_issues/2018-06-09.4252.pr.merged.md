Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1213

Proposed clarification of docs re scope of "using A for B". 

PS: Hope I have the git workflow thing correct -- it's been quite a few years since I was forced to use git, so very rusty ;P

Thank you @chriseth. Please let me know if there's any more places you feel the docs could use some attention -- no bounty nec.

Thanks a lot! We have tons of issues labeled "documentation", most of them could be done by externals.
