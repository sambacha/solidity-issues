There needs to be guide on how to use debugger on remix IDE.

I'm not sure this belongs to the Solidity documentation and not into the Remix documentation. Why would you put it here?

@axic , I am suggesting to have a debugger section for solidity, which is missing as of now.

What would be the benefit to put that here instead of the more comprehensive Remix documentation?

Remix is missing extensive documentation. Most of the solidity developer uses Remix where they would like to have knowledge of debugging option. So, I think we should include. If it doesn't fit here, we can skip this part.

Remix is currently spending a lot of effort in creating such a documentation and there is a lot more to explain about Remix than just the debugger.

Sure, in that case I would close this issue.
