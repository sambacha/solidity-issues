# [\#4260 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4260) `closed`: Improve error message: ABIEncoderV2 public functions with struct containing the tree of mapping (nested mapping)
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

ABIEncoderV2 public functions with struct containing the tree of mapping with struct. For example, this code returns the error:

> browser/test.sol:19:26: TypeError: Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public or external functions.
function addQuestion(MyStructName2 _x) returns (bool result) 
            ^--------------^

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract Test {
    struct MyStructName1 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
        mapping(uint => MyStructName2) x;
    }
    struct MyStructName2 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
        mapping(uint => MyStructName3) y;
    }
    struct MyStructName3 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
    }
    function addQuestion(MyStructName2 _x) returns (bool result) {
    }   
}
```
But here is no recursion. This code, for example doesn't return error:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract Test {
    struct MyStructName1 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
        mapping(uint => MyStructName2) x;
    }
    struct MyStructName2 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
        mapping(uint => MyStructName3) y;
    }
    struct MyStructName3 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
    }
    function addQuestion(MyStructName3 _z) returns (bool result) {
    }
}
```

I believe recursive mappings looks like:
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract Test {
    struct MyStructName1 {
        address addr;
        uint256 count;
        mapping(uint => MyStructName1) x;
    }
    function addQuestion(MyStructName1 _x) returns (bool result) {
    ....
    }
}
```
So I think here are two options:
1) to accept using nested mapping (rather than recursive).
2) to throw the correct error, for example: "Nested types is not allowed for public or external functions."
But I think that there is no reasons to prohibit nested mappings.

The issues is not about the nesting. The issue is that mappings can only live in storage.

We should improve the message to state this, though.

This could use the template @bit-shift built for returning error messages in deep calls..

@erak I unassigned you for now assuming you are not actively working on this. Feel free to re-assign if I was wrong :)

Should be solved with #7739

Solved by #9146
