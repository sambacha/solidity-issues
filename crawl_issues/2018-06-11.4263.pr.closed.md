@axic Please help me in understanding. In this issue, we need to make user understand why they are getting parse error right? As of now the statement we are getting is same for all types of error. So I made it more highlighted that its syntactical error

I think this task requires quite a lot and big changes in the parser, so I would suggest to start with some issue, which is way smaller.
