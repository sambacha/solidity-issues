# [\#4274 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4274) `merged`: [BREAKING] var keyword removal

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-06-12 10:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4274):

This is my work-in-progress branch-PR for the removal of the var keyword.

That means:
* the var keyword is simply disallowed instead of completely removed (for now)
* all tests have been adjusted to not test (or depend on) the var keyword anymore.

Please also remove `for (var i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++)` from the security considerations entry in the documentation.

What seems left is the test behind [syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/262_bound_function_in_var.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/262_bound_function_in_var.sol):

I couldn't get it ported. We also had a vague discussion wrt. that issue, but I *may* need some little support (some guidance) to get this test passing, too.

It tests assigning bound (e.g. those which have their first parameter as "self" aka the type of variable they are bound to/overloaded) functions to `var`.

I don't think there's any bound function to function type test, so this one could be change to do that.

However, currently named parameters are not working with function types, so you need to change `g({x: a});` into `g(a)` (and perhaps leave a comment noting that).
