* the first test ensures solc fails on multi-assignment without named vars (mind: var keyword is about to be removed also)
* the second test ensures solc fails on assigning void to a variable.

I've been splitting up those tests with regards to the discussion in Gitter. /cc @axic

Can you squash some of the commits?

Also need to run `isoltests` to regenerate expectations.

@christianparpart is this still a relevant PR?

@axic I would not say so. It all started by "just adding one test" and then diverged. My proposal would be to close it, and whenever we feel we want to add a test, we do so, atomically. :-)

Thanks! I think all the tests from here were merged already.
