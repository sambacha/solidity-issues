I'm not sure this is a generic OK thing, but I think it should be fine for `soltest` for now.

We recently changed a little how NoProof chains operate: earlier each block's difficulty was hard-coded to 1, now each block's difficulty equals to parent block's difficulty (that was needed by some testing code and also seems less weird to me https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4938 ) 

soltest didn't provide genesis difficulty, so it's 0 by default and then 0 for further blocks, and then blockchain went crazy, because new mined blocks didn't grow the canonical (highest total difficulty) chain.

So explicitly providing genesis difficulty in chain params is a fine way to fix this I think.
