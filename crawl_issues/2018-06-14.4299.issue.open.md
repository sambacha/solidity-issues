# [\#4299 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4299) `open`: behavior of named arguments in function types
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `medium effort`, `low impact`

- #2428's initial intention was to remove named arguments in function types
- They are currently marked as deprecated.
- They were considered to be removed in #4219.
- However, there was no consensus about removal, so so far they are still there, but still deprecated.

However, they do not work as desired (in case they are not removed and undeprecated after all). Naming arguments in calls should work, but doesn't:
```
    function(uint a, uint b) returns(uint) f;
    f({a: 1, b: 2)};
```

Assigning from functions with different names doesn't work either, but it has been suggested that it should (to be discussed):
```
contract C {
   function f(address recipient, address sender) { ... }
   function g() {
     function(address sender, address recipient) localf = f;
     localf({sender: ..., recipient: ...});
   }
}
```

I'm fine with resolving this either way (leaning slightly towards disallowing), but this should of course be fixed.

Currently it emits an error:
```
4299.sol:5:6: Error: Too many arguments.
     localf({sender: 4, recipient: 4});
     ^-------------------------------^
```

And declaring them emits two warnings.

```
contract C {
    function fn() public pure {
        function(uint a) returns (uint) f; f;
    }
}
```
yields:
```
browser/Untitled.sol:4:18: Warning: Naming function type parameters is deprecated.
        function(uint a) returns (uint) f; f;
                 ^----^
```
```
browser/Untitled.sol:4:18: Warning: Unused local variable.
        function(uint a) returns (uint) f; f;
                 ^----^
```

The second warning is rather weird.

I think the second one is a bug ðŸ˜‰
