Wonderful! Can you please add an entry into Changelog.md?

Added! I'd consider adding an entry to the [Contributing](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) page asking contributors to add their changes to the changelog :)

@nventuro good idea! Can you create a PR? :)

I wonder if there should be:
- another peephole step before this turning `0xff...ff` into `0 NOT`
- or another step checking for `0xff..ff AND`

Reason: the constant optimiser would do this for us, but is only run if the optimizer is turned on, while peephole is run always.

Another though: perhaps this step would be better to be placed in `RuleList`.

Downside: would only be run if "all optimisations are used", but the above case would be covered and the peephole optimiser right now seems to cover mostly changes over blocks (jumpdest) and removal (pop). These cannot be handled in the rule list atm.

@axic are you suggesting I add those optimizations on this PR? Regarding `RuleList`, I'd consider something like this a trivial optimization, and would be surprised to see non-optimized code  containing that sequence.

A lot of the steps in `RuleList` are trivial (and in fact similar to this one) and would be better to be turned on by default - see #1658 as a relevant issue (and its appropriate PR).

Note that this is already part of the RuleList. The question would be if we should just add all rules in RuleList to the peephole optimizer (at least where it is possible).

I would rather consider running `RuleList` even when the rest of the optimiser is disabled.

@axic that's what I meant. The problem is that currently, RuleList is only used by the CSE which does not do simple replacements. So the task would be to either add a step to the peephole optimizer which uses the RuleList or add another optimizer step that cannot be disabled which uses RuleList as a simple replacement list.

Not sure what caused the CI to break, since all I changed is the test, which passes on my machine:

```
solidity/build/test $ ./soltest -t Optimiser/* -- --ipcpath /tmp/testgeth/geth.ipc --testpath CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/libevmasm/Optimiser.cpp.o

Running 50 test cases...

*** No errors detected
```

The backend died - restarted the tests.
