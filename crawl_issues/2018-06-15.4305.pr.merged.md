# [\#4305 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4305) `merged`: Determine transaction status in RPC sessions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-06-15 10:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4305):

Note that due to a bug in ``cpp-ethereum``, for byzantium or newer, this will **not** work as expected with the version of ``cpp-ethereum`` used for the CI tests (all transactions will be reported as successful).

Both pre-byzantium, as well as with all EVM versions in combination with more recent versions of ``cpp-ethereum``, this will work, though.

I suggest updating ``cpp-ethereum``, so that we can merge this.

This is a prerequisite to accurate test expectations in #4245.

Depends on #4324.

@axic @chriseth What's the procedure for updating ``cpp-ethereum`` used for the tests?

IIRC it can be built using the scripts in `scripts/cpp-ethereum` directory. And in `scripts/tests.sh` you can find the currently used hashes.

@ekpyron did you had any chance building the new cpp-eth binaries?

@chfast by any chance are there any public builds of aleth?

@axic I haven't gotten around to build new cpp-ethereum binaries and I think it makes more sense if that's done by someone who runs an Ubuntu system (the current ubuntu binaries won't work for the current archlinux I'm running, so I'd not be surprised if there would be problems in the other direction as well). Also I don't think I have permissions to create releases in the cpp-ethereum repo. Not sure whether it's necessary to build a new "Solidity Tester" release there or whether we could/should just use the 1.4.0.dev1 binary release there directly.

Sure there are: https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/releases

What does the documentation currently say about the required cpp-ethereum version?

@chriseth Well, not every transaction. Contract deployment is now checked to be successful by default, but for function calls ``SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`` still uses empty results as indication for transaction failure (so ``callContractFunction`` does not require a successful transaction for now). This could be changed already, but would lead to a huge PR, and I think it makes more sense to keep it like this for now and to start to always check the transaction status after the semantics tests are extracted.

Ah sorry, could you please also update the documentation in a separate PR?

@chriseth There's already  #4345 for the documentation. Do you think we need another one?

Ah ok, that's of course fine!
