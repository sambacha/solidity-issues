# [\#4308 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4308) `closed`: Conversion to a different "known" contract type is possible

Using Remix, `version:0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Emscripten.clang`.

This code will compile.

```
contract A {
    function f() public returns (uint) {
    }
}

contract B {
    function g() public returns (bool) {
    }
}

contract C {
    function h() public returns (bool) {
        B b = B(new A());
        b.g();
    }
}
```
Guessing that the issue is that it will implicitly cast `new A()` to an address. Not casting `A` will cause a compiler error, i.e. `B b = new A()`.

There is not much information about the contract type in the docs (though I may have missed something) but given that the code below fails, it seems like typing is nominal:

```
contract A {
}

contract B {
}

contract C {
    function h() public returns (bool) {
        B b = new A();
    }
}
```

Regardless, it seems like the code in the first example should fail.

Explicit conversions between all contract types is allowed, we might consider removing that (and forcing users to at least go through `address`).

Will be fixed with 0.5.0 and tracked in #4320.
