# [\#4309 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4309) `merged`: Correctly choose python version for scripts requiring python2.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-06-15 14:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4309):

Some of the python scripts only work with ``python2``. Similarly to ``docs/conf.py``, which requires ``python3``, their first line comment should refer to ``/usr/bin/env python2`` instead of ``/usr/bin/python`` - otherwise they will fail on distros that use ``python3`` by default (e.g. Archlinux).
