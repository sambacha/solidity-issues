**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

The section that describes how to use NatSpec-style comments in Solidity source files (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/layout-of-source-files.html?highlight=natspec#comments) is misleading. It refers to the Doxygen documentation, but should rather refer to the NatSpec documentation itself: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format.

Apparently, NatSpec only supports a subset of the Doxygen tags, which is currently not reflected in the documentation.

The misleading documentation might also be the cause for this:

the very same code compiles with remix - I think the etherscan coders just also had problems finding the list of allowed tags and just probed some - and missing "dev" in the process.

Had trouble googling for the list of allowed tags before also - but thanks to @bit-shift I found it.

I have gone through the doc and found that they have written something like "comment called a natspec comment, for which the documentation is not yet written." whereas, I found https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format  There they have written about natspecs. Can we put summarize format of that link in solidity doc along with example. As of now the example is written for Doxygen
