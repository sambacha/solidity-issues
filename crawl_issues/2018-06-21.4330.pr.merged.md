This PR is a prep for #4274 and contains all the changes that can be applied before the latter PR is to be merged.

Also @chriseth, I could do the same with the soltest's, and I wonder whether or not to do it in *this* PR or create another one (also for documentation .rst file adapts to not use/mention "var"). - What do you think?

Please rebase.
