# [\#4335 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4335) `merged`: Disable gnosis tests temporarily

One of the reasons tests fail is that we are compiling them for byzantium, but the old Truffle Gnosis is using has an old VM not supporting that. Updating Truffle seems to be breaking Gnosis unfortunately and only the last release supports setting `evmVersion`.

Merging this now so we can finally progress.
