This is the first part of the split of #3046. It adds a severity enum so that the formatter can pick the appropriate colors to underline each message type.

This could be taken up again. I would argue that "fatal" should not be its own severity, because it is just an internal designation which means that further processing cannot be performed - but it is not that this error would be in any way more "dangerous" or something, it is just an error that blocks further processing.

Closing this PR, as original author is unresponsive. Work is continued in the related revival PR.
