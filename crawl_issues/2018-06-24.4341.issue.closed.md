# [\#4341 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4341) `closed`: Compiling with SMTChecker on 0.4.24 fails
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3839700?v=4" width="50">[nuevoalex](https://github.com/nuevoalex) opened issue at [2018-06-24 00:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4341):

I get the following error when attempting to compile the [Augur contracts](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/tree/upgrade_solidity) using 0.4.24 with SMTChecker enabled:

```
{
component: 'general',
formattedMessage: 'InternalCompilerError: \n',
message: 'Internal compiler error (/solidity/libsolidity/formal/SMTChecker.cpp:816):',
severity: 'error',
type: 'InternalCompilerError'
}
```
This error is reproduce-able by building the Augur project on the branch above and running:

`npm run docker:run:test:security:smt`

Hi @nuevoalex , could you be more specific about the contract that causes the crash? We've fixed (unreleased) similar crashes in the SMTChecker recently so it could be a duplicate.

I will check latest build from the develop branch and see if it still occurs.

I built solidity `0.4.25-develop.2018.7.4+commit.cde976ca.mod.Linux.g++` and executed `npm run docker:run:test:security:smt`, fixed a number of SMT errors (mostly about implit casts in Augur.sol emits) and stopped on this one:

```
libraries/collections/Map.sol:52:16: TypeError: Explicit type conversion not allowed from "bytes32" to "address".
        return address(getValueOrZero(_key));
               ^---------------------------^

libraries/collections/Map.sol:56:16: TypeError: Explicit type conversion not allowed from "bytes32" to "address".
        return address(get(_key));
               ^----------------^
```

This used to work previously and I am not sure how to change the explicit cast here. In the end the task may take a lot of time. Perhaps @leonardoalt do you happen to know how to deal with the error above?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2018-07-04 18:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4341#issuecomment-402542639):

To avoid this error you probably want to use ``address(uint160(uint256(get...)))``.

To explain why this now needs to be that verbose: addresses are 160 bits, i.e. 20 bytes wide, so converting from ``bytes32`` needs to truncate. However, you could either truncate the "left" 12 bytes or the "right" 12 bytes, so an explicit conversion is still ambiguous.

Suppose you have
```bytes32 b = bytes32(0x111122223333444455556666777788889999AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFCCCC);```

Now in older compiler versions, the conversion ``address(b)`` resulted in the address ``0x777788889999AaAAbBbbCcccddDdeeeEfFFfCcCc``. However, it would be equally plausible to assume that it would result in the address ``0x111122223333444455556666777788889999aAaa``.

That's why newer compiler versions force you to make the truncation explicit in the conversion.
You can either use: ``address(uint160(bytes20(b)))``, which results in ``0x111122223333444455556666777788889999aAaa``,
or you can use ``address(uint160(uint256(b)))``, which is what ``address(b)`` used to do and results in ``0x777788889999AaAAbBbbCcccddDdeeeEfFFfCcCc``.

Ok great! @leonardoalt , @nuevoalex , InternalCompilerError does not occur anymore after all my changes including the latest one as advised by @ekpyron.

@nuevoalex I will branch off your branch and submit the PR there for you so that you can review and merge this.

For reference I am attaching the pre-released solc 0.4.25-develop.2018.7.4+commit.cde976ca.mod.Linux.g++  with SMT support (requires z3 solver installed). The compiler can be temporarily used until the next version is released.

@cryptomental great!

I'm confused though, by which task gitcoinbot is talking about, since this won't need any changes on Solidity's side.

Hi @leonardoalt I would be grateful if you had a look at https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/pull/706 , the last comment from @nuevoalex mentions that without SMT enabled compiler throws an error. Looks indeed like a bug in the Solidity compiler.

Hi @cryptomental ,
I don't think this is a bug, rather a confusion with your versions.
Please note that the declaration complaints have nothing to do with the SMTChecker, they are part of the normal compiler checks.
Your pre-release binary is above tag 0.4.24, which means it has features that were present in the experimental 0.5.0 mode and are now default, but still has older ones. The `Identifier already declared.` error you see is part of the old scoping rules, where a single variable declaration was valid for the entire function and a second declaration led to an error. With the new scoping rules (C99-like) this wouldn't be an error. I also ran your solc binary on a similar code and it was fine, so I'm not sure the docker version is using the correct binary.

Thank you @leonardoalt for the detailed explanation. I will double check that the non-SMT build behaves as expected with the same compiler.

@leonardoalt was right.

Non-SMT build uses 0.4.24 compiler, SMT-enabled build uses compiler 0.4.24+ binary with new scoping rules. I reverted the change and made the code compile on both versions. I believe the issue can be closed on Solidity side after Augur team confirms.

You mean `develop` of augur or solidity?

This issue can be closed on Solidity side, on Augur side it can be closed after https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/pull/706 is merged.

Augur's PR enables Solidity version with SMT fixes. After 0.5.0 is released, Augur contracts will likely be upgraded and the SMT will use the released solc version.
