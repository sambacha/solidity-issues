For me, it looks like the following Git commit has introduced this behaviour:

https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/commit/42b927d7aa103e21e34c8ba8c5469f532b49f966

This commit adds dummy values for `mixHash` and `nonce` (inspired by values were cpp-ethereum's own tests), and now, soltest runs fine again.

This looks OK for me, but need a confirmation from either @gumb0 or @chfast before merging.
