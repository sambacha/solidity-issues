In these instances I think I do prefer the `if` statement for readability. There is a lot of parentheses and operators on the left condition.

Why do you prefer the ternary operator over the if statement?

@axic Yea, I thought about that too. But the point is, those two conditions seemed short enough to implement ternary operator, which will reduce the whole file vertical length a little bit without compromising too much readability. I found some other short conditions too where ternary operator can reduce 4-5 line each. This way the readability in a whole for the file can be increased. :slightly_smiling_face:

I think the original version was much better readable. Vertical length is irrelevant in cpp files, as long as individual functions are short.
