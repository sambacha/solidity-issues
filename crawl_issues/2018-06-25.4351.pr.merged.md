@leonardoalt I was going to ask the same, but I thought you mentioned it isn't finished. Can you rebase, since it hasn't been for a while and would be nice to retrigger new tests?

@axic Rebased. The query timeout is still missing in general, but this should be fine on its own.

I've made `solverAnswered` static also squashed the 3 logic changing commits into one, because it was confusing. Sorry if you wanted to keep it.
