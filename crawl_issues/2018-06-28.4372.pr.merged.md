Suggestion for code duplication: have operator== check implicitly convertible and then check anything else that can vary implicitly (state mutability).

Also, I think the conversion needs to be different than just allow a less strict state mutability. It should not be permissible to implicitly convertible any state mutability that is not payable to payable, since if the taget type is payable but the function is not, sending ether would throw, which seems to violate payable guarantee.

Also, perhaps a payable function should be able to be stored in a nonpayable pointer, since no other state guarantees are made, and it is permissible not to send ether to a payable function, so no guarantees are violated.

@meowingtwurtle Yeah, I was just implementing operator== in terms of isImplicitlyConvertible :)

Good point about the payable stuff.

@JesseBusman thanks for your contribution! Do you still have time to finish this? If not, please tell us so someone else can take over and do the last missing bits.

@chriseth It's vacation time, but I think I can do it this evening.

Needs to be rebased and also lacks a changelog entry.

@axic Can some experienced git user do this? I have no idea how to rebase, or split a PR into two.

If you don't want to figure it out, make sure the box that says allow
mainteners to edit PR is checked.

To rebase:

```git fetch origin/develop```
```git rebase origin develop```
(Just exit the editor that opens)
Fix any conflicts, then ```git add``` them, then ```git rebase --continue```
```git push -f```

If you need to split a PR into two, you need to remove the change from this
PR. Rebase away the commit (```git rebase origin/develop``` then change the
line with the commit from pick to drop). If you need to fix files in other
commits that depended on the change, change the word on that line to edit,
then make changes when you reach it, followed by ```git add``` and ```git rebase
--continue```

I'm taking this over.

This is failing tests now.

Will do another review when they are running again.
