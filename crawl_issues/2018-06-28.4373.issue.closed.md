This can now be handled better since we create the stack slot at the same time the variable comes in scope and not at the start of the function.

Ah, that's a nice benefit of the new scoping rules ðŸ˜‰

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Is this still the case? Seems like something we would want to optimize.

I know that we at least solved it for memory objects: #10341. Not sure about other types.
