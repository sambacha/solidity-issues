# [\#4374 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4374) `merged`: V050 var keyword removal preparations (End-to-End tests)

This PR eliminates any occurrences of the "var" keyword in the compiled tests and must be merged *before* #4274.

FYI: the last commit in this PR is special and I'd like to get your feedback on this. I did not find any way to express this in Solidity language syntax, and IIRC, any `FunctionType` not of `Kind::External` or `Kind::Internal` or `Kind::External` is lacking representation in Solidity language wrt. var-keyword removal.

There is a failing test, you have to remove the component to fix it.

@chriseth Thanks, I didn't run with `--evm-version homestead` locally. Fixed & only AppVeyor seems to not have finished testing on the CI side yet. (everything else is green)
