This minor change makes the `scripts/install_deps.sh` recognize Manjaro Linux distros, and treats them as Arch distros.

Manjaro Linux distributions are basically the same as Archlinux. From the site:
"Manjaro is a user-friendly Linux distribution based on the independently developed Arch operating system."
