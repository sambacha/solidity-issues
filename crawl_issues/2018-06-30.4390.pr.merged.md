# [\#4390 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4390) `merged`: Add abi.decode

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-06-30 16:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4390):

Fixes #3876
 
There might be an argument for rather using `abi.decode(data, (type1, type2))` instead of `abi.decode(data, type1, type2)`

The community seems to prefer `abi.decode(data, (type1, type2))`.

Actually, this is a grammar change and should be documented in ``docs/grammar.txt``, shouldn't it?

@ekpyron in which way? I didn't touch the parser. `Expression = Identifier | ... | ElementaryTypeNameExpression`

Ok, I hadn't noticed that a ``PrimaryExpression`` is an ``Expression`` and that a ``PrimaryExpression`` can be an ``ElementaryTypeNameExpression``. ~~However, ``abi.decode`` can still be used with arrays, etc., and with ABIEncoderV2 even with struct's as well, can't it? That still won't fit the grammar - those aren't ``ElementaryTypeName``s, but ``TypeName``s (maybe the grammar been wrong in this regard for a while).~~ [this was wrong; I hadn't really thought about the ``TypeType`` type and identifiers and index accesses as expressions for array and struct types]

I wouldn't have expected to find the ``ElementaryTypeNameExpression`` as a kind of ``Expression`` - but indeed it seems one can do things like just ``int;`` and ``int[100];`` in solidity, even though they don't have any effect - I didn't know that so far :-).

Rebased.
