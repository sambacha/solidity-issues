# [\#4392 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4392) `closed`: Allow constructor to be external?
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

One way to see is that a `public` is both `internal` and `external`.
So why can't a constructor be `external` given that it can be `public`?
Is `public` on a constructor identical to `public` for a function?  If not, should there be a different keyword than changing the meaning of `public` for a constructor?

It would also be useful if marking a constructor `external`, prevented the contract from being inherited from.

(Related but wasn't resolved in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3132)

Your argumentation makes sense, but somehow I feel that the keywords here do not directly translate to constructors, since you call a constructor only implicitly. Using an external `external` constructor to essentially create `final` contracts is also a little bit indirect for me.

I agree the keywords are awkward; and we should avoid `external` if the effect is intended to prevent inheritance since something like `final` is more understood.

Maybe following is the topic to focus on and find some other keyword than `public` for the constructor?

IMO constructor should be `external`.  It **CANNOT** be called internally, it can only ever be called by some external party.  To put this another way, any function that you cannot flag as `internal` should not be flaggable as `public`.

Recommended Remediation: Remove visibility modifier from constructor entirely (on the argument that it doesn't really make sense) or make `external` the only option since `internal` doesn't make sense, and thus `public` doesn't make sense.

Thinking more on this, I *think* this may currently be used for abstract classes (where they should not be instantiated directly, always derived from).  I would rather see a dedicated keyword for this like `abstract contract` than re-use `internal` on a constructor to represent this concept.

Yep, I would second this. Even when calling `new SomeContract()`, `create` is used to deploy the bytecode to an address, which is definitely an external call. IMO the usage of the `new` keyword constitutes an internal call, but contract creation doesnâ€™t. 

I would push back a bit on the remediation though, but I think that your suggestion of using the `abstract` keyword rather than marking the constructor as `internal` would significantly clarify the behavior.

Thanks for commenting on this! I remember learning about the difference between `constructor` and `function` visibility a while back, and `public` really felt like a misnomer.

Note that constructors of base contracts are called internally, while the most derived constructor could be say do be called externally. Once we have `calldata` data location for function parameters of internal function, this distinction is not too relevant anymore.

I agree that removing visibility is probably the cleanest solution.

@marenz remarks that there are internal types that can only be used with internal constructors.

Cannot we loosen that so constructors can see every type in the given contract?

I understood that the problems are internal function pointers or storage pointers.

It's not exactly a concern, just a point to consider: A c'tor like `constructor(function() internal pure _fp)` currently must be `internal`. Without the keywords we have to decide how this case should be handled. Would it be implicitly internal because it uses internal arguments? Would be require `abstract` to be used for the contract?

The solution I see is to require the contract to be abstract.

Closing since external does not work with inheritance and we aim to remove visibility completely (#8162).
