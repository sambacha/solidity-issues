# [\#4404 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4404) `merged`: [WIP] v0.5.0 var keyword type suggestion

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-07-02 15:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4404):

_((NOTE: This PR is rebased on top of #4274 in order to work. This PR (currently) exists only of one single commit containing the necessary changes))_

This PR enhances #4274 by also suggestion what type to use instead of just reporting that `var` keyword is disallowed, which should greatly help bigger projects in adapting their software (as it helped me adapting the tests).

As some types cannot be expressed without the `var`-keyword, we must inform the user about that.

### Tuple-Assignments Wording
```
    Use of "var" keyword is disallowed. Use explicit `(type1 var1, ..., typeN varN)` instead.
```

What happens here if you use `var (a, b) = ...`?

@chriseth in case of `var (a, b) = ...` it will report twice, once for `a` and once for `b`. That was (until now) intended. We could however make a joint error message, something similar to:

```
    Use of "var" keyword is disallowed. Use explicit `(type1, type2)` instead.
```

@chriseth all recommendations incorporated.

@christianparpart I took the liberty to adjust the syntax myself. Please merge if you agree with the changes.

So `var` will not be a keyword anymore and the user will get a misleading error message? I think it would have been nice to keep the deprecation error.

@axic did you take a look at the error message? Why do you think it is misleading?

@chriseth @christianparpart Sorry I didn't see it was moved. However, I think this PR lacked test cases to trigger both of those error messages:
a) `Type cannot be expressed in syntax.`
b) `Use explicit declaration...`
