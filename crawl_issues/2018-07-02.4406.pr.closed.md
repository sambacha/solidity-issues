# [\#4406 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4406) `closed`: Use aleth instead of eth

`./scripts/tests.sh` takes the renaming of `eth` to `aleth` into account only when running in CI's.

This super minor change modifies the script to look for the `aleth` binary instead of the `eth` binary. Without these changes, the script hangs right after emitting the message "Commandline tests succesful" because it's waiting for cpp-ethereum to boot up indefinitely.

It might be a good idea to give feedback or throw if the boot up didn't work. Perhaps with a timeout?

I think this was done in #4325 too?
