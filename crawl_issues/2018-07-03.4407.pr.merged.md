# [\#4407 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4407) `merged`: Avoid hanging in tests.sh when IPC program is not found

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/550409?u=8a9c1866e2239e265861f72d7bbd3f3b1358ae6b&v=4" width="50">[eternauta1337](https://github.com/eternauta1337) opened issue at [2018-07-03 01:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4407):

Atm, `./scripts/tests.sh` will hang with no feedback other than the message "Commandline tests succesful" if aleth/eth is not found. This happens because the script gets stuck in line 108, trying to reach `/tmp/tests/geth.ipc` and iteratively sleeping for 1 second indefinitely.

This PR simply adds a function that prints a message when the IPC tests start, and checks that the program exists before actually trying to use it. Otherwise, it exits with 1.
