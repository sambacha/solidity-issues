Surprisingly small amount of tests affected by this...

@chriseth I added a number of new test cases. It seems that so far the tests mainly checked for the absence of the "can be restricted to ..." warnings. I renamed those test cases to make it clear what they are testing and for most of them added a copy with restricted mutability that expects failure.
Do you think we need even more test cases?
