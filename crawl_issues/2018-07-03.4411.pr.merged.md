another trivial one. tests passing locally (soltest, cmdlineTests.sh)

My guess would be that you need to fix the contracts in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/tree/master/test/DAO for the solcjs tests to pass.

Yes, and please note that you have to update the DAO050 directory since there is some logic inside the solidity tests that rename that directory. Running tests locally will probably compile the other files.

I think the correct one is the ``DAO`` directory (in contrast to the ``DAO040`` directory) - currently the test scripts remove ``DAO040`` and copy ``DAO`` to ``DAO040``, so that the correct files are used as long as the version is not bumped to 0.5.0 (see ``test/solcjsTests.sh``).

Are there 0.5.0 specific syntax tests for this? If so, are those obsolete?

solc-js tests still have to be updated it seems.
