Progress on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1219 also closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4339 as content is restructured.

I improved some grammar and typos as I merged, but not the entirety of a document, which I'll do later. I haven't reformatted to the 99 char limit as a lot of the exisiting lines already broke that, again maybe a later PR.

Spoke with @chriseth and I had already started working on this intending to create a PR for the whole task, I can break this up into smaller PRs if really needed, and from now on I will do that, which will mean a lot of small PRs to close #1219.

First PR, so I'm sure there's something else that's not quite right :)
