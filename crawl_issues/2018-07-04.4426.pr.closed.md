Second PR covering https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1219

These two are more complex, so hopefully the contribution makes sense.

I think this PR removes a lot more content from the FAQ than what is covered by the lines added?

@axic I'm not entirely sure what you mean? Do you mean in a pure diff sense? I wasn't really sure how to break up these PRs really, I can just reset the _frequently-asked-questions.rst_ file for each PR and only remove the items removed. Is that what you mean?
