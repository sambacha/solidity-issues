# [\#4427 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4427) `closed`: Turn uninitialized storage returns into an error?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-07-04 13:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4427):

In #4415 the warnings about uninitialized storage pointers are turned into an error.
However, there's also a warning about uninitialized storage returns (see ``ControlFlowAnalyzer.cpp``). This was not turned into an error in experimental 0.5.0 mode, but we need to decide whether we still want to turn it into an error now.

Example:
```
contract C {
  struct S { bool f; }
  S s;
  function f() returns (S storage c) {}
  function g(bool flag) returns (S storage c) { if (flag) c = s; }
  function h() returns (S storage c) { if (true) c = s; }
  function i(bool flag) returns (S storage c) { c = s; }
  function j(bool flag) returns (S storage c) { if (flag) c = s; else c = s; }
  function k() returns (S storage c) { if (true) c = s; else c = c; }
}
```

``f``, ``g`` and ``h`` issue a warning, whereas ``i``, ``j`` and ``k`` are fine.
There may be fals positives as in ``h``, but they can be circumvented as in ``k``, so for this reason we can consider turning these warnings into errors.

@chriseth mentioned on gitter, that he is in favour of turning it in an error.
I myself tend to agree.
@axic What about you?

Meeting decision: turn into error.
