Fixes #4089.

And I wonder whether there should be more test cases for this...

@ekpyron I also thought about that. Would you recommend to test that ``payable`` and ``nonpayable`` do not use ``STATICCALL``, also in combination with different EVM versions?

@bit-shift I thought about adding more end to end tests that expect reverts on state changes when staticcall is used... but there's one test for that, maybe that suffices...
The other way round is probably rather well tested - every non-reverting (external) function call in the end-to-end tests that changes state is a test for that. I suspect there are a few of those, but I didn't check :).
So I'm not sure - it's probably fine as it is already...

@bit-shift Maybe you're right - I just quickly looked through the end-to-end tests and it's fewer storage-writing external calls in there than I'd have expected that test this (maybe I missed a lot of them, though)...

So maybe it does make sense to add an explicit tests to ensure that payable and non-payable calls don't staticcall and don't revert when writing to the storage, just to be sure.

Added a test for that

Thanks, missed that.
Updated now.

Improved doc, rebased and squashed

This reminds me: do we have a test case which tries to do state modification through inline assembly (and is not detected), but it doesn't actually changes the state due to staticcall?

I guess we do detect all these possibilities in inline assembly.

We have tests to detect state modification through inline assembly and thus change the state mutability of the function, so I think a semantics test would be redundant, but we can still add it of course.
