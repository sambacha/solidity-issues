~~Documentation still needs to be updated.~~

Is there a test that does `(uint a, uint b) = f()` where `f()` returns nothing? Some for `(uint a) = f()` and `uint a = f()`?

@chriseth Now there is.

Sorry, I just rebased one last time, after #4465 was merged, to be sure there was no conflict in the tests.

Which was a good idea, since taking both PRs together another v050 variable can and has to be removed.

Build fails.

Oh - I must have rebased to an not-up-to-date version of ``develop``. Should work now.

@chriseth Rebased. I had to change the argument types of ``createTupleDecl`` and ``typeCanBeExpressed``, though, but it should still be fine.

Please rebase.

Rebased... again :). I hope after I don't know how many non-trivial rebases, everything that might conflict with this is merged already now. And hopefully I didn't mess up anything during all the rebasing :).
