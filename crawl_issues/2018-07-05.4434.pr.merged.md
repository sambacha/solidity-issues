# [\#4434 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4434) `merged`: Update isolate_tests.py

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/388605?u=c038834687e1b11f1cfc815c338b03a3938a235b&v=4" width="50">[mattaereal](https://github.com/mattaereal) opened issue at [2018-07-05 00:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4434):

On the documentation the examples for the usage of isolate_tests.py are shown with single files, and it's currently not working. It only works for folders or wildcards that return more than one file, since that's how os.walk works within a loop for that cases.

Proposed an simple and easy fix.

I extracted the core functionality for extracting tests from files, and made another function called `extract_and_write`
If the program receives a single file the function `extract_and_write` is called once, it even works for `docs` when specified.
If the program receives a path or a wildcard, works as used to.

Merging this even fixes the need to review the examples where a single file was used as an input.
