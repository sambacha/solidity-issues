~~Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/296~~ (merged)

This results in:
- Travis: emscripten changed (1.38.8)
- Circleci: emscripten changed (1.38.8)

It also seems possible to use newer versions of emscripten, when restricted to ``asm.js``. For that a list of exported symbols as used in solc-js has to be provided, though, and solc-js has to be slightly adjusted to account for different naming (e.g. ``Runtime.addFunction`` => ``addFunction``).

A web assembly build seems possible as well, but so far I did not get the solc-js CLI to work with it (may be worth looking into, though, since it's less than half the size and seems way faster than the asm.js build).

@axic can you tell what the problem was?

It may be that the problem was connected to the gnosis tests that are currently disabled, since they are broken anyways...

#3491 was failing to compile with an updated emscripten version. Perhaps it will compile with the new boost version.

Let's push these changes onto that PR and see if it compiles. If at least it is not significantly worse than it is right now, I'd vote to merge this PR.

However, does it affect the soljson size? Is it smaller? Bigger? Unfortunately we do not have speed tests (should) to see how that differs between the two boost versions.

@axic Do you think we should fix solc-js to include the hack in the test scripts here? Should be easy to do in a "backwards"-compatible way and might be nice, if people want to build and use ``soljson.js`` locally.
Same goes for the ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`` in solidity - we could automatically add them, if a newer emscripten version is detected.

The ``solc-js`` test fails naturally, since it downloads a different version of ``soljson.js`` in which ``addFunction`` is still named ``soljson.Runtime.addFunction`` and not ``soljson.addFunction`` (which is what it is called in the ``soljson.js`` built from this PR). This would need some fix in ``solc-js``, if we want to continue with this PR...

To me it seems we could also apply this after merging #4486.

Should also take `VERBOSE` and `STRICT` flags into consideration (from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3491/files#r233630763) in this PR. Maybe also `EMCC_DEBUG`.

From v1.37.23 onwards there are a lot of breaking changes in Emscripten. Should review them and what effect they could have. Likely we need to adapt our compile options and/or solc-js.

We could also skip this PR and move directly to ``1.38.18`` - but that would definitely require some further adjustments: currently the build fails with undefined references to some ``std::string``-related functions, if I recall correctly.

@axic Regarding the additional compile options:
I added ``STRICT=1`` - that will prevent us from using deprecated compiler options, which makes sense - and our build still works.

I don't think we need or should unconditionally add ``VERBOSE`` or ``EMCC_DEBUG`` at this time - those are just meant to produce more compiler output in case of bugs.

Moving to "Inbox" in 0.5.4 in the hopes that we see some progress on this. The PR is still done and just needs a review.

@axic I extracted the emscripten changelog between the versions (starting from the latest change, so to be read from bottom to top) and left a short comment on each of them, stating why I think it doesn't affect us or is already addressed, so I think all of this should be fine:


Emscripten Changelog between the versions 1.37.21 and 1.38.8:

  - [ ] Breaking change: Simplify exception handling, disabling it by default.
   Previously it was disabled by default in -O1 and above and enabled in -O0,
   which could be confusing. You may notice this change if you need exceptions
   and only run in -O0 (since if you test in -O1 or above, you'd see you need to
   enable exceptions manually), in which case you will receive an error at
   runtime saying that exceptions are disabled by default and that you should
   build with `-s DISABLE_EXCEPTION_CATCHING=0` to enable them. **We compile with -O3, so no effect.**
 - [ ] Fix regression in 1.37.37 on configure scripts on MacOS (see #6456) **We compile on Linux, so no effect.**
 - [ ] MALLOC option, allowing picking between dlmalloc (previous allocator and
   still the default) and emmalloc, a new allocator which is smaller and
   simpler.**We don't use this option (might consider it, though)**
 - [ ] Binaryen update that should fix all known determinism bugs.**Nice!**
 - [ ] `addFunction` is now supported on LLVM wasm backend, but when being used on
   the wasm backend, you need to provide an additional second argument, a Wasm
   function signature string. Each character within a signature string
   represents a type. The first character represents the return type of a
   function, and remaining characters are for parameter types.
    - 'v': void type
    - 'i': 32-bit integer type
    - 'j': 64-bit integer type (currently does not exist in JavaScript)
    - 'f': 32-bit float type
    - 'd': 64-bit float type
   For asm.js and asm2wasm you can provide the optional second argument, but it
   isn't needed. For that reason this isn't a breaking change, however,
   providing the second argument is recommended so that code is portable across
   all backends and modes.**Only affects WASM backend, which we don't use**
 - [ ] LLVM and clang updates from upstream (5.0svn, close 5.0 release).**Good!**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Don't export the `ALLOC_*` numeric constants by default. As
   with previous changes, a warning will be shown in `-O0` and when `ASSERTIONS`
   are on if they are used.**Not used by us**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Don't export FS methods by default. As with previous
   changes, a warning will be shown in `-O0` and when `ASSERTIONS` are on, which
   will suggest either exporting the specific methods you need, or using
   `FORCE_FILESYSTEM` which will auto export all the main filesystem methods.
   Aside from using FS methods yourself, you may notice this change when using a
   file package created standalone, that is, by running the file packager
   directly and then loading it at run time (as opposed to telling `emcc` to
   package the files for you, in which case it would be aware of them at compile
   time); you should build with `FORCE_FILESYSTEM` to ensure filesystem support
   for that case.**Not used by us**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Remove the `Runtime` object, and move all the useful methods
   from it to simple top-level functions. Any usage of `Runtime.func` should be
   changed to `func`.**Supported by solc-js now**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Change `NO_EXIT_RUNTIME` to 1 by default. This means that by
   default we don't include code to shut down the runtime, flush stdio streams,
   run atexits, etc., which is better for code size. When `ASSERTIONS` is on, we
   warn at runtime if there is text buffered in the streams that should be
   flushed, or atexits are used.**We already had it set to 1 explicitly**
 - [ ] Meta-DCE for JS+wasm: remove unused code between JS+wasm more aggressively.
   This should not break valid code, but may break code that depended on unused
   code being kept around (like using a function from outside the emitted JS
   without exporting it - only exported things are guaranteed to be kept alive
   through optimization).**WASM related, doesn't affect us**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Similar to the getValue/setValue change from before (and
   with the same `ASSERTIONS` warnings to help users), do not export the
   following runtime methods by default: ccall, cwrap, allocate,
   Pointer_stringify, AsciiToString, stringToAscii, UTF8ArrayToString,
   UTF8ToString, stringToUTF8Array, stringToUTF8, lengthBytesUTF8, stackTrace,
   addOnPreRun, addOnInit, addOnPreMain, addOnExit, addOnPostRun,
   intArrayFromString, intArrayToString, writeStringToMemory,
   writeArrayToMemory, writeAsciiToMemory.**All we need are exported in this PR**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Do not polyfill Math.{clz32, fround, imul, trunc} by
   default. A new `LEGACY_VM_SUPPORT` option enables support for legacy
   browsers. In `ASSERTIONS` mode, a warning is shown if a polyfill was needed,
   suggesting using that option.**Doesn't seem to affect us, probably not used by us**
 - [ ] Breaking change: Do not export getValue/setValue runtime methods by default.
   You can still use them by calling them directly in code optimized with the
   main file (pre-js, post-js, js libraries; if the optimizer sees they are
   used, it preserves them), but if you try to use them on `Module` then you
   must export them by adding them to `EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`. In `-O0`
   or when `ASSERTIONS` is on, a run-time error message explains that, if they
   are attempted to be used incorrectly.**Adjusted in this PR by adding to EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS**

The generated size seems to be ~100k smaller (9080k vs 9230k)
