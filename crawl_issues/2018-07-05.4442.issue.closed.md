# [\#4442 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4442) `closed`: Add codespell to CircleCI
**Labels**: `help wanted`, `build system :building_construction:`, `good first issue`

[codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) is a tool that finds common spelling mistakes and even suggests corrections. We should add that as another workflow item to our CI run on CircleCI. It should run both over the documentation and over the code.

Hi!

The action plan is:

* run codespell against Solidity codebase and docs locally
* integrate the codespell run into .circleci/config.yml

Running codespell was rather straightforward. The tool returns a non-zero return code if a typo is found. The return code equals the number of typos found.

E.g:

```
08:54:14 (feature/add-codespell) /free/solidity/libsolidity/ast$ codespell
./Types.h:291: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./Types.h:1034: does't  ==> doesn't
./Types.h:1060: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./Types.h:1065: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./Types.h:1110: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./Types.h:1111: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./Types.h:1112: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./AST.h:404: iff  ==> if  | disabled due to valid mathematical concept
./AST.h:1172: expresion  ==> expression
./AST.h:1174: expresion  ==> expression
./AST.h:1176: expresion  ==> expression
./Types.cpp:952: acutal  ==> actual
08:54:16 (feature/add-codespell) /free/solidity/libsolidity/ast$ echo $?
12
```

How should circle ci handle the return code? Just display the number or fail the build if a typo is found?

Nice! Please make it fail on any error, i.e. just run it.

@cryptomental also can you please create a PR to fix those typos (except the `iff` ones)?

Is there a way to disable the warning for `iff` in codespell?

Would like to work on this if the original worker drops it :)

Hi, I will also submit a PR to fix the typos and create a whitelist dictionary that will contain 'iff'.

Hi @chriseth, @axic I opened a PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4462, looks good but let's wait for Circle CI results.

Apart for codespell integration I also fixed all typos, some had to be fixed manually where there was more than one alternative. I included two words in the whitelist: "iff" and "nd", the latter one was included in one of the tests.

Thank you @chriseth for merging it and closing the issue. I would be grateful if you clicked 'Work accepted' on GitCoin as well.

@cryptomental it seems only @vs77bb can do that.
