# [\#4443 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4443) `merged`: Fix crash when declaring the same var twice in the same scope

Fixes #4414 

In #4414 an assertion fails because there is an assumption that the declarations are ok. The error is reached before that, but since it's not fatal the component goes on. My suggestion is to turn the error into fatal.

Arguably, it might be nicer to remove the assertion on the other end (in DeclarationContainer.cpp) and instead try to deal with these cases gracefully, since we want to reduce the amount of fatal errors... but maybe it's easier here to just make it fatal.

In any case, there should still be test cases for this.

I don't think we should remove the assertion. The code where the assertion is shouldn't be reached in the first place if the variables are not properly declared. I also don't think we should simply check it again at that point, that would just duplicate code.
But if fatal errors are undesired I'll think of something else, it should be possible ;)

Well, I think the general policy is supposed to be as few fatal errors as possible and where ever it's possible to continue processing from the most reasonable "sane" state, so that later errors are not swallowed... but not at all cost, of course - in this case I'm not sure, so at least I would say: if you see a straightforward way for making it non-fatal, then do it, otherwise just leave it fatal - in any case: tests ;-).

Removed the fatal error and added syntax tests.
