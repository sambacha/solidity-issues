This is super good news, thanks @axic, @chriseth and @bit-shift!
I suggest you tweet about this and make some noise spreading the good news,  maybe some other ethereum projects will join :)

Adding a code of conduct is a first step, but not a big achievement. Enforcing it properly is the tough task, so I'm not sure if we should already celebrate this as good news.

Should this CoC apply to the entire organization, or only to this repository? If the entire org, would it help if we copied it to the other popular repositories?

As well; the CoC is mentioned mainly in relation to Pull Requests. Does the Code also apply for issues and other interactions around solidity (Gitter, Etc.)? If so, we should make this a bit more apparent. I'd be happy to PR a change for this.

@RichardLitt thanks, that's a good point! I think we do not have the authority to make this apply to the whole organisation, but extending it to the two solidity-related gitter channels is probably a very good idea. Please create a PR!
