# [\#4453 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4453) `merged`: Add Code Of Conduct

Closes #4445. 

I took the template from https://www.contributor-covenant.org/ because it seems to be a good starting point. I quickly took a look at the CoC's of some open source projects and a lot of them based theirs on this template.
Do we have an email address that could be used as the replacement for ``[INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]``?

The website suggest to add a reference to contributors guide / readme with a text similar to:
> Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

I think it would make sense adding a link to the contributors guide as well as to README.md.

I think we should also add something like
```
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing khmer-project@idyll.org which only goes to C. Titus Brown and Michael R. Crusoe. To report an issue involving either of them please email Judi Brown Clarke, Ph.D. the Diversity Director at the BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action, an NSF Center for Science and Technology.*
```

 - do you know anyone who comes to mind?

Hm, do you think the documentation is the right place to add this? This sounds like we want to extend the code of conduct to the users of the compiler - which would be nice but is probably too invasive ;)

@chriseth I've seen projects where the Code of Conduct was part of the documentation and I thought we could follow the pattern we have already in place for referencing ``contributing.html`` from ``CONTRIBUTING.md``. But yes, perhaps you're right and we should provide it as Markdown and link the raw content from the documentation.

@chriseth Regarding your previous comment about reporting issues involving either you or @axic: is there anyone from the foundation who could take care of these reports? Otherwise we could probably pick someone from our team?

I think we should also put a comment about the code of conduct into the Pull request template (and add one if we don't already have one).

@chriseth https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4546 is addressing the pull request template, so we can merge this already :)

@bit-shift do you want to squash this?

@axic Yes, I'm going to squash this now.
