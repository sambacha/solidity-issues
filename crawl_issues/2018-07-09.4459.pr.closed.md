Any way to have a proper error and not an assertion?

Perhaps we can also just remove the assertion. It was meant as an actual assertion but now I'm not sure anymore if this is the only situation.

@ekpyron @chriseth is this in conflict with #4508 ?

I think this still can be merged, even though #4508 also fixes the underlying issue.

Were all tests added already in #4508? I would be happy for @ekpyron to take this over, I think I need more time to get into the matter again.

@chriseth  OK, I can take over this one. I need to think about whether this PR is actually still necessary or useful or whether we can even use stronger asserts here after #4508 is merged myself, though.

After #4508 the original assertion should always work again, so this PR is superfluous.
