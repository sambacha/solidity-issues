It has been called as the "Contract ABI" on the original wiki page too and it seems to make more sense.

> Does this break URLs?

The internal chapter link is the same and the filename is the same. I don't think so.

However the part after the hashtag will be different, but since it is the chapter title it should make no difference: `https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html#application-binary-interface-specification`

Merging this now, lets see if it causes any issues.
