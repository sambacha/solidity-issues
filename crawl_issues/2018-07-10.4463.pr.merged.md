# [\#4463 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4463) `merged`: isoltest: adds support for properly handling ANSI escape sequences on Windows

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-07-10 08:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4463):

Windows by default doesn't support ANSI escape sequences by default, but we blindingly output them.
Since Windows 10 v1511 however, they are supported, but we have to explicitly tell the Terminal to interpret them.

This PR enables color output for isoltest only for now, but we can generalize it after 0.5.0 release to make use of it in other executables, too (when the solc colored error messages come into play).

We should probably try to get the appveyor tests to pass for this one, though :).

AppVeyor seems unrelated, it's saying ``out of gas``, hmmmmm.

The external tests also have the gnosis tests enabled. Maybe this is again based on an old version of ``develop``?

@chriseth: fixed VS2015 compilation by restricting the `#ifdef`
