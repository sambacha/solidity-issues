Hi,

this is the *minimal* version of my fix to properly compile *and* link on Visual Studio 2017 (latest version).

I am not sure how on earth other people can properly ``link`` without that change, except, that my VS2017 is maybe to new and the fact, that I am using the native Visual Studio's support for CMake files (that is: I am not using generated .sln files).

I will however provide a second PR (linking this one) with some more changes I'd like to see on top, closely related to building Solidity on Windows via Visual Studio.
