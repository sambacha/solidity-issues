As a companion PR to #4467, this PR actually not just fixes building Release mode on VS2017, but also supports Debug modes by not hard-coding nor forcing to Release-mode.

This is actually necessary to properly develop'n'debug using VS2017.

* I also made some minor changes to .gitignore that I do not want to create a seperate PR for (too small)
* along the way, I found that ``cmake`` was hard-coded too, some lines below ``ExternalProject_Add``, so I adapted that one, too.

@chfast I *may* have been using an old ``develop`` branch as base of this PR. I've rebased now, and wait for the results. (@ekpyron hinted, that those errors may be due to gnosis, which should be disabled.)
