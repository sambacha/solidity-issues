Follow-up from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3876 :

If possible, ABI-decoding should be done in a lazy way, especially in functions marked `external`: Function arguments should be immutable (even value types) and should only be decoded when requested. This is especially useful for deeply nested array and struct data.

Similarly, `abi.decode` could return a special virtual data type where decoding is only done when the data is converted to a mutable or memory data type.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
