I'm closing this one for now, since there's still some issues with the webassembly build. We can reopen for testing once somebody manages to solve those (strange imported and exported symbols in ``soljson.wasm``, slow loading time, solc-js compatibility, finding and loading ``soljson.wasm`` during external tests and in general).
