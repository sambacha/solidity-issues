Functions cannot be used as mapping keys (e.g. the following contract does not compile):

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Foo {
  mapping(function (uint) pure returns (uint) => string) a;
}
```

The parser actually only allows elementary types, so I think we should further correct that sentence - not sure how it ended up there.

In addition to that, I have seen that some days ago, it might be that there is an issue about this already.

I opted for the short correction (though the list is still incomplete and wrong) since there's barely any mention of elementary types on the docs (I'm not even sure there's a full list anywhere), I didn't want to create any additional confusion.

Maybe a full-fledged elementary-vs-complex types section is due?
