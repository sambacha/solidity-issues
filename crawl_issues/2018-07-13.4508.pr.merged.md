# [\#4508 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4508) `merged`: [BREAKING] Don't exclude public state variables when looking for conflicting declarations.

Fixes #4417.

The issue suggests to allow name conflicts if function and getter end up having different signatures. I think state variables with the same name as a function are always bad and we should disallow them unconditionally.

Additionally the former behaviour was inconsistent - the following failed (``Identifier already declared.``):
```
contract C {
    function f() public pure {}
    uint256 public f = 0;
}
```
Whereas this was fine:
```
contract C {
    uint256 public f = 0;
    function f() public pure {}
}
```

We *did* have an example in the docs using this pattern (and I could imagine people using it in practice), so I'm unsure: do we want to allow name conflicts between public state variables and functions? If so, we should do so independently of the order of declaration and fix the underlying issue some other way. @chriseth @axic?

I like the idea of disallowing state variables with the same name as a function.

Technically there is no conflict if the function is internal, since it won't have an external signature.

If we want complex rules, we could allow that case only. However I would prefer to not have this ambiguity, but this is a breaking change and should be labeled like that.

We specifically left these things out of scope of 0.5.0 to be properly discussed in the inheritance issue, but if this is a small thing to fix, we can include it and even change it again with 0.6.0 if we want.

Does this still work:
```
interface ERC20 { function x() external returns (uint); }
contract C is ERC20 { uint public x; }
```

I added two additional test cases that clarify the behaviour of this PR wrt the case in the comment in the last commit.
I had not seen #4459 for some reason.

I think it may make sense to include the change in this PR, especially since otherwise the behaviour seems to depend on the order of declaration, which to me seems generally undesirable. I haven't checked how #4459 solves the underlying issue, though.

@axic Moved the Changelog entry to "Breaking Changes" (not sure in which cases it actually worked and didn't crash before, but you're probably still right that that's more appropriate).

I think this looks good apart from agreeing on the style changes.

Can be merged in my opinion once the documentation style is fixed.

@axic I updated the example in the documentation and now only rename the variable ``auctionEnd`` to ``auctionEndTime`` which makes more sense and is consistent with the style guide.
