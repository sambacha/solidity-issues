Removes v050 pragma and updates all tests.
All behavior previously guarded by v050 pragma is now not guarded.
A few syntaxTests are failing, these regard erroring on value transfer to contract without payable fallback, which cannot be checked currently because of required cast to address.
Fixes a bug in TypeChecker regarding modifiers on constructor in v050 that was causing tests to fail.

Wow, I'm sorry. I feel really stupid, forgot that other people did this. People are welcome to use my updated tests if so needed.
