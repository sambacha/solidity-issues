# [\#4518 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4518) `closed`: [BREAKING] Throw error for no data location for function params.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17399486?v=4" width="50">[chase1745](https://github.com/chase1745) opened issue at [2018-07-17 02:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4518):

As discussed in issue #3402 and original PR #4014. This has been split up into #4488, #4489, and #4512. This is the final PR and contains the logic for the breaking change as well as the tests.

Yeah, that makes sense. Working on it now.

@chase1745 would you have time to apply changes for the above comments this week? If not, would you mind if we finish it?

I have an implementation but am running into some new, small issues. I'm going to revisit it tomorrow afternoon, so if I don't get a good commit by tomorrow night, I don't mind handing it over to you all to finish up.

@axic @chriseth Take a look at this implementation and let me know what you think. I believe it is quite a bit simpler now. The error messages are similar to what @chriseth suggested. I get a set of allowed data locations for the variable, and if the given location is not in that set, throw an error. If you have any suggestions for the wording of the error messages let me know, they aren't exactly what I had in mind, but I couldn't think of a better way to word them.

This PR still allows external function parameters to default to `calldata`, as that wasn't included in the original PR (#4014 ), and this one is already pretty large, so I think it may be better suited for a separate PR. I can add it to this one if you all think its appropriate, though. As mentioned above it will require quite a few tests updates both internally and externally (solc-js and OpenZeppelin).

~Just need to update a few test cases I apparently missed and CI build will be passing. Will do that this afternoon.~ Nevermind, the tests that it says are failing don't match the commit files. Are there still issues with AppVeyor?

@chriseth I made all the above changes except for the ones with comments, please see my replies to your comments on `AST.cpp` line 511 and `ReferencesResolver.cpp` line 345. Will squash the extra commits later once everything is good to go.

Note that these error messages are among the ones that users will see most often when switching to 0.5.0 so I think they should be as helpful as possible.

No problem, I understand this is a pretty significant change, so it needs to be as clean as possible and 100% correct! I've started and should be able to finish the rest of the changes tonight.

I think there is no easy way to put it, but it seems there is a big overlap between this PR and #4425 - both started out fixing different issues in the data location area and then of course fixed the whole thing.

In this PR here, I like how inferring the allowed data locations is nicely singled out into a function.
The other PR, though, also fixes the data location of function type variables.

How shall we proceed? I fear the best way to solve this would be for e.g. me to create a new PR that picks elements from both your PRs (and of course also assigns authorship to both of you). What do you think?

I'm sorry that this happened, we should have been more careful.

@chriseth I understand! 
This issue originally really set out to only remove default data locations for function parameters anyways, it was just kind of difficult to do that without tackling the issue in the other PR. 

Feel free to edit and throw in elements from this PR in the new one you mentioned.

Just to confirm, the issues I ran into in the end, (with scope, etc.) are solved in the other PR, and I do not need to continue with implementation?

> the issues I ran into in the end, (with scope, etc.) are solved in the other PR, and I do not need to continue with implementation?

Do you mean the issue about data locations in function types? My approach is to simply check whether the declaration ast node is inside a `FunctionTypeName`.

@chriseth Please feel free to create a new PR.

PS. In #4425 I do not always enforce the data location keyword. I only enforce the data location keyword whenever there are multiple valid data location choices, which is different from this PR (#4518). But maybe always enforce the keyword is a better design choice? I'm not sure.

Thanks for your understanding! So I will take over from here now.

Yes, @sifmelcara solved the scope issues and yes, we should always enforce data location.
