I think this was the reference PR - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4212

I tidied up some language, changed some of the code examples that were using wrong/outdated namespaces, or changed them to use namespaces that the docs of the project use.

@axic Ahh, I was using Node (which made more sense to me). OK, I'll check the code in a browser example as I'd like to understand how it all works anyway.

OK @axic I reverted the code, I think I'll revisit this page soone though and make some of the examples clearer, or to be more precise, make it clearer how to write and run them.

Please split the web3.js change into a separate PR. You are moving from the web3.js 0.x API to the 1.x API, and I believe the 0.x is still more common, given 1.x is not even released yet.

@axic I reverted to the original text submitted by the original poster, so I'm not sure what the web3.js change you're referring to is? Unless I missed something somewhere or misunderstand you?

Rebased and squashed. @chriseth I missed your comment (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4523#discussion_r203402750) and attempted to address it, but after some searching, I wasn't necessarily any clearer, and it seems that there are other issues to document this better anyway (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/681). So I may address that separately when I look at that issue.

@axic still waiting for clarity on your comment (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4523#issuecomment-423129476)
