- natspec annotations on constructore where ignored.
- as discussed: the constructor natspec will be placed within the `methods` node and will just have the name `constructor`.

_Recreated PR. I recreated my `constructor_natspec` branch and cherry-picked the actual change. I wasn't aware of that this will also remove the original PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3666, related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1141._

@chfast hmm.. looks like that there is a problem with codecov, the current diff is not reflecting the actual changes.. or did i missed something?.. 

probably the lates analysis is just not yet finished.. was just wondering about that diff..

I guess the stuff just changed because of squashing some commits. Let's see ;)

@chfast for me it looks like an issue with codecov
@axic appveyor seem to hang.. probably because the initial commit was already done in march..

Codecov waits for all CI to complete, but when you force push commits to a PR it freak outs and can send out an invalid report. You will get a new one when AppVeyor finishes.

@axic i saw accidentally that the natspecs are (now?) part of the meta-data. Regarding a potential change of the natspecs so that they may support arbitrary tags could have the advantage that users can add user-defined structured meta-data through those tags.

@chriseth Any idea when we can expect to see this in a release?

It will be part of 0.5.0. Sorry for the inconvenience.
