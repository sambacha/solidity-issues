It is the standard generally used by OpenZeppelin & represented in the latest EIPs such as 721.

Would it make more sense to open an issue and discuss this there?

@thegostep thank you for taking the time for creating this PR!

We are not sure ourselves about this rule and would like to get more feedback from the community about it. We think that it is better done via an issue, than as a PR, because PRs constantly need to be worked on (rebased) and usually the community doesn't take a look at them, only at issues.

We've discussed this today on our meeting and as a result I'd like to ask you to create an issue where this can be discussed.

Closing this PR now, hope you understand.
