# [\#4544 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4544) `merged`: Code coverage

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/573380?u=6cd4b0f473d862749cbed137d0bb32b726ae071f&v=4" width="50">[chfast](https://github.com/chfast) opened issue at [2018-07-23 14:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4544):

Fixes #2663.

- Integrates codecov (separate "flags" for type checker only and for all tests).
- Adds `COVERAGE=ON` CMake option to build with coverage instrumentation.
- The linux build moves whole build dir to test job (takes 1 min). I was not able to move only `*.gcda` files with circleci config.

@axic Here you can see the coverage for type checker only and for all tests: https://codecov.io/gh/ethereum/solidity/commit/a1d3e72bb51fe45a6af531c20863037c759c6765/build

I will try to show it here in the following PR.

Merging this as it is better to have it in this state (at least entirely uncovered lines can be tested for).

@chriseth please review this when you're back if any circleci changes would be needed.

If we ever do releases from circleci, we have to remember that the binaries have coverage instrumentation enabled, which should not be done for release binaries.

Perhaps it would be good to not do coverage on tags?

Oh, this one isn't finished, it doesn't separate the tests properly.

It at least does the separation in the pull request comment.
