# [\#4558 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4558) `closed`: Wrong warning on shadowed declaration 
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Solidity prints the declaration shadowed warning on a contract like 
```solidity
contract A {
  function foo() external { }
  function bar() external {
    uint foo = 10; // warning that internal variable `foo` shadows the function `foo`.
  }
}
```

But actually, because function `foo` is external, it is not internally accessible in `bar` function unless `this.foo()` or `a.foo()` is used, so I think function `foo` is not shadowed by internal variable `foo`.

Fair point, we may have to discuss this in #3729, but in general I would agree it shouldn't give a false warning.

The call to `resolveName(...)` in `DeclarationRegistrationHelper::registerDeclaration(` - line 484 also searches for invisible declarations - and the function `foo` is invisible. I'm not 100% sure why we did this, but I think it is better to warn about such cases than not warn about other cases.

Current behaviour - it still exists as a problem:
```
4558.sol:4:5: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    uint foo = 10; // warning that internal variable `foo` shadows the function `foo`.
    ^------^
4558.sol:2:3: The shadowed declaration is here:
  function foo() external { }
  ^-------------------------^
4558.sol:4:5: Warning: Unused local variable.
    uint foo = 10; // warning that internal variable `foo` shadows the function `foo`.
    ^------^
4558.sol:3:3: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure
  function bar() external {
  ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

Is this ticket blocked by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3729 or is there a concrete next step that can be taken to close this?

Not sure - what do you think, @axic?

You are right, I think it would simplify the situation.  It is a low-priority issue so I would suggest to perhaps postpone it until that is solved.

Actually it might be a good idea to keep the warning (and just change the text) - it is still easy to confuse the variable and the function even if it would not be visible.

On the meeting there were no strong opinions whether to keep this warning or not, but we were leaning towards keeping it because missing the fact it is `external` and in fact not actual shadowing is easy, thus the warning is helpful to avoid mistakes.

There was agreement though to improving the message would be nice.
