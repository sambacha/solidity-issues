Is it actually crucial? I do not think so. But I may be wrong.

Explanation of changes:
The scanner has many different functions for pattern matching. When you validate the source code's syntax, on failure return a Token::Illegal_[ret_code_name] and then check the current token for equality with that return code when you need to, and throw a fatalParserError with a custom string. You need to add to the Token "code" enum macro to make new Illegal_[ret_code_name]. I believe you can just extend the if else chain I have started in the Parser.cpp to handle new Token enum types. I have made a comment there.

Thanks for looking into this!

I think we haven't fully specified the requirements properly, but [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1802#issuecomment-391543993) is an indication of what we're looking for.

Can you please have a look and ask any questions if it is not explained well enough?

@JacobStewart64 are you still working on this?
