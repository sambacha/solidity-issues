# [\#4589 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4589) `merged`: Fix shared boost test library build by customizing main

### Description

Dynamic linking to boost test was broken by #4572 (which address the misuse of boost unit test library).

Customizing main is needed according to boost document: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_67_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/shared_lib_customizations/init_func.html

This patch doesn't affect static link boost build. Not sure if this fix creates potential issue for shared build though.

I use `cmake -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DINSTALL_LLLC=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DBOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK" ..` to configure the build for shared boost libraries.

cc @chfast could you review this change? Thanks very much

@chfast I have tried to make static boost use custom entry function, but keep getting undefined reference error and I have no idea about the correct way to correctly fix it.
```
CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/boostTest.cpp.o:boostTest.cpp:function main: error: undefined reference to 'boost::unit_test::unit_test_main(bool (*)(), int, char**)'
```

@chriseth @ekpyron can you please review this?

Checked the linked documentation and this seems to be correct way.

What is a bit more worrying is that our initialisation function is kind of obsolete (but still works): https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/obsolete_init_func.html

I added the small change to ``test/CMakeLists.txt`` myself.

@chfast no, checked it.

@ekpyron actually should have a CI task to build it in shared mode?

@axic It might be a good idea - I'll open an issue for it.

@axic Why do we actually statically link to boost by default in the first place? We may want to do that for binary releases, but I don't think it should be the default...

I'm not sure.

@axic OK - we can consider changing it in #4660.

Maybe we should merge this PR before #4660 is addressed? (I saw #4660 tagged with `0.5.1` tag, and we probably want this PR be part of 0.5.0 release because many distros prefers dynamic linking to boost)

0.5.0 should be as smooth as possible, I fear we already did too many changes to the build system for such an important release. I'm almost certain that 0.5.1 (meaning a small bugfix release) will follow shortly after 0.5.0 :(

@chriseth Well, this change is pretty harmless - it should affect only cases that are broken right now anyways and as @sifmelcara points out, it may be good to have shared linking support as fixed up again as soon as possible, so I'd vote for merging this in 0.5.0.

@ekpyron I agree, this is not the problematic PR ;)

@chfast and objection to merging this?
