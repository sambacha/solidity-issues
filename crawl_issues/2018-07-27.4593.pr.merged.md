Closes #3972 

@axic Can you try this with your Z3 4.5.0? Mine doesn't hang for some reason. I did test it on individual nonlinear cases though, and it works.

Actually I managed to make mine hang on develop, and this branch fixes it.

It fixes the problem on my computer.

As discussed on Gitter, the `!=UNSAT` to `==SAT` change is a fix, where possibly under a timeout, `UNKNOWN` is returned and the model may or may not be there. Perhaps can you just split it into two commits (timeout vs. the error fix) with relevant commit messages?

Can you just squash it please? :)

In general we could also elevate this to be a member function and be overridden by the solvers, but that's a future thing.
