The `for` loops are too verbose and any user can make mistake when increasing/decreasing counters: https://github.com/makoto/blockparty/issues/175

It would be much better to have `map/filter/reduce/range/all/any` like in Python so people can iterate and apply input in consistent and uniform way that is safe and easy to read.

You may refer to all built-in Python functions here:

While this is a good idea, most of the operations that could benefit from that are rather expensive so it is questionable whether such things would be used much, but as I said, still nice to have.

This probably requires #911 and perhaps even #869 to be really useful.

I don't think it'd need https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/869, unless it supports more than arrays., but I think it needs https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/911 with capturing

We discussed as part of https://twitter.com/nomorebear/status/1254000358361186306, range based loops would have avoided some mistakes. (But also unit testing would avoid them too)

I am absolutely in favor of range-based loops at the very least.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
