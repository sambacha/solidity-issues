# [\#4602 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4602) `merged`: Added guards for unknown pragmas

EDIT: I will have a look at the VS failures 

### Checklist

- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests passing
- [ ] ~~Created tests which fail without the change (if possible)~~
- [ ] ~~Extended the README / documentation, if necessary~~
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

### Description

Removed push/pop if there was no change to the warnings *in the same
file* for a given compiler. This assumes the imported boost headers use
a warning stack themselves.

The pragmas don't seem to be required anymore, but were not removed to
mantain compatibility with older versions of the boost library.

Compiled with
- clang version 6.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_601/final)
- gcc (GCC) 8.1.1 20180531
 against:
- libboost 1.67.0-5

I've removed those ignore statements locally and it compiled clean with clang with boost 1.66.

~~@chriseth what is the boost version we are tied to because of trusty?~~ Apparently we force ourselves to compile with boost 1.54, these pragmas might be required for that.

I usually prefer to ignore the warning about unknown pragmas.

Somebody needs to rebase it, seems testing stuck a week ago.

@axic Rebased - let's see what the tests say.

@hackaugusto I think rebasing the branch in your fork to the current develop branch of the solidity repo messed things up a bit, sorry about that. Could you maybe update/fast-forward the develop branch of your fork and rebase this PR on top of that? Otherwise the CI systems seem to be confused.

Hi @ekpyron the branch was rebased 2 days ago, but [circleci's mac builds are not running](https://circleci.com/gh/hackaugusto/solidity/31). Maybe I should disable the build for my fork?

@hackaugusto That may help, yes! I'm not quite sure why for this PR circleci runs in the fork and not in the ethereum/solidity repo (usually it does the latter) - if you can disable the build for the fork, that might remedy this (I hope it's not too much trouble).

@hackaugusto I guess you disabled the build in the fork - or in any case the tests are passing now. Thank you very much!
