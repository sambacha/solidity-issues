### Description
This PR closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1211.

The only source I could find that mentions clearly that Contract types inherit from address types was here (https://ethereumbuilders.gitbooks.io/guide/content/en/solidity_features.html), so I think it's true, but I'm not 100% certain.

@axic Let me know what you think of these changes and then I'll squash

@ChrisChinchilla sorry after #4321 this was in conflict, rebased it and had to slim it down quite a bit. Can you please have a look and potentially improve it?

OK @axic Take 2, combined and tidied, if you like, I will rebase.

I think the initial sentence did not provide much of value. It might be beneficial to add an example, but I think the `new` keyword is too complex here. Perhaps something like 

```
If you declare a local variable of contract type (`MyContract c`), you can call functions on that contract, but take care to assign it from somewhere that also is such a contract.
```

OK @chriseth took your changes, tweaked slightly, removing passive voice (which I am doing bit by bit ðŸ˜„ ) and some other clarifications, let me know if they are accurate and if this is good now :)
