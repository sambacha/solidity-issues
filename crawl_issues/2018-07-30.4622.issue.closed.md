**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

Currently there are two places for assembly grammar:
- grammar.txt
- the Yul chapter in the documentation

It would make sense to clarify them to have matching understanding or somehow merge the two (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3151#issuecomment-340270780 for more information).

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
