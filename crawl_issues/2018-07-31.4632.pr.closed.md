Please explain the changes you made here.
Added struct called Elementary Types to replace the frequently used `IntegerType(160, IntegerType::Modifier::Address);` and `ArrayType(DataLocation::Memory, true)` etc , they can be directly referenced like `ElementaryTypes::Address` making it more readable .
Thank you for your help!
