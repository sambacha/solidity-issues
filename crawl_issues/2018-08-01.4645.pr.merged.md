The `div` test is failing because it expected the solver to say unknown but got SAT. Is the CI using CVC4 as well?

Do you think the following is a good idea: one must have both solvers installed in order to update smt tests.
This way we could ensure the most precise result and have CI do the same.

I didn't finish this yesterday, but actually was thinking to keep those unknown ones in the C++ code for the moment.

I rebased this and resolved some conflicts with the JSON AST test extraction.

Interesting - ``smtCheckerTests/049_division.sol`` takes a long time for me to run (I locally disabled CVC4, since there's still compilation issues on Archlinux) and returns ``UNKNOWN``, hence yielding ``Overflow ... might happen here``, whereas on travis it returns ``SAT``, yielding ``Overflow ... happens here`` - I guess on ~~travis~~ circleci CVC4 is enabled?

We should investigate this. In the long term we will probably have to add expectations that are specific to the enabled solvers similarly to EVM version specific tests in #4262.

I think I will create a ``test system overhaul`` project one of these days and structure all test related issues and improvement suggestions into clean issues and add them to that project (it's not too urgent, though, I think we won't do any of that before ``0.5.1``).

The same test does seem to return ``UNKNOWN`` on MacOS as well, though.

In general I'm a bit uneasy about this change. The SMT component is not predictable. We might even get test failures depending on the CPU capacity we have because of timeouts etc.

Ok sorry, perhaps put differently: This is not about this PR, but in general, we should be careful about SMT tests.

@chriseth That's true, but (as you noted) not really related to this PR. I created #4735 for tracking this, but I would say we should still find a more immediate solution for this PR.

Maybe the easiest (though somewhat unsatisfactory) solution to this is *not* to extract this one test for now and to think of a better solution later on?

What is the state of this PR?

I think we can follow @ekpyron 's last suggestion and merge most of the tests (except the ones that use non-linear arithmetics).

Rebased and updated this PR to not extract division tests.

Yea I'll submit another PR fixing that and organizing the files in dirs

@axic Can we merge this?
