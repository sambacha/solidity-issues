### Description

I've observed that EVM output often contains sequences of ISZERO opcodes with more than 2 elements. For example, in the EVM opcode structure that returns a boolean value:

```
239 JUMPDEST
240 PUSH1 40
242 DUP1
243 MLOAD
244 SWAP2
245 ISZERO // <------- HERE
246 ISZERO
247 ISZERO
248 ISZERO
249 DUP3
250 MSTORE
251 MLOAD
252 PUSH1 20
254 SWAP1
255 SWAP2
256 ADD
257 DUP2
258 SWAP1
259 SUB
260 SWAP1
261 RETURN
```

As far as I can tell, these sequences make sense as long as there is 1 or 2 elements at most. Eg. 3 consecutive ISZEROes are equivalent to a single one. We don't want to cancel out 2 ISZEROes though, because they have the potential consequence of changing a top stack value that is neither 0 or 1 to a boolean.  

This simple peephole optimization ensures that there is never more than two consecutive ISZERO opcodes.

NOTE:
I see that the CSE optimizer already tackles this optimization, but I thought I'd still make the PR for you to consider this lower level implementation for the optimization.

For this reason I think the better solution would be finishing #1658 and enabling CSE without enabling constant optimiser.

Another option would be to write a peephole optimizer that applies all rules in the rule list.

Thx. Feel free to close the PR! This was more of a learning experience for me than anything else.
