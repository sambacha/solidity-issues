### Description

Fixes #4651.

#### What
- Implements #4651 
- Compiling flags to make solvers integration optional.
- Documentation of how to do it.

#### How
I modified ``libsolidity/CMakeLists.txt``, ``FindCVC4.cmake`` and ``FindZ3.cmake``, where the solvers are found and added to the linking stage.
Modifying cmake's variable ``PACKAGE_FOUND`` as a result from calling ``find_package`` upon CVC4 and Z3, I was able to trick the logic into setting the value to not found when compiling with flags ``-DUSE_Z3=OFF`` and/or ``-DUSE_CVC4=OFF``.

Title underline for SMT Solvers on documentation section was too short and made CI fail, another commit was added to repair this issue and now is _passed_.

I was kind of hoping to go with a flag for each, such as `USE_Z3` which is on ON by default, and if set to off it just disables the `find_pkg(Z3)` solving the entire problem in 1 line.

Probably there is even a better way where the user can override `HAVE_Z3`, @chfast may have a good proposal for it.

I don't think overriding HAVE_s is a good idea.

You say that each solver has to be manually enabled? Like: cmake -DUSE_Z3 -DUSE_CVC4 etc?

Ok, let me try something simpler.

Done. 

By default, enabled. If you want to disable them, you have to do it manually:

``cmake -DUSE_Z3=false -DUSE_cvc4=false.``

Much simpler code actually. Overrides the finds.

Should I create another PR or commit over this one?

I think we're finally done! Much better, simpler, clearer, and using cmake's style.

@axic I don't know why I did not understand you at first with the ON/OFF flag, my bad. 
@ekpyron thanks for the review!

An extension of this might be to use three values for ``USE_CVC4`` and ``USE_Z3``: e.g. "yes", "no" and "auto". The default would be "auto" and the behaviour in each case could be the following:
 -  ``USE_*`` being "yes" and ``*_FOUND`` being "false" is a CMake error
 - ``USE_*`` being "auto" and ``*_FOUND`` being "false" raises a warning
 - ``USE_*`` being "no" always disables the solver, but does not raise a warning

We can merge it, as it is, and extend it later on, though (and this extension may not be necessary in practice).

I would prefer to wait for @chfast who is back on Tuesday, because he may now a good way in CMake where we can just use a single variable: if it is set off it wouldn't run detection, otherwise runs detection, the rest of the code checks for existence as usual.

@axic That's exactly what this PR does right now, isn't it?

No, I think there might be a way to keep using a single `Z3_FOUND` and `CVC4_FOUND` for both forcefully disabling it and for detection.

I guess it is an another question whether that is a good idea or not, but @chfast usually knows what is the best practice in cmake.

Ah, that's what you mean. Well ``Z3_FOUND`` and ``CVC4_FOUND`` are internal variables that are not supposed to be set by or exposed to the user and usually aren't used that way - I don't think changing something about that is a good idea and the ``USE_*`` pattern is rather common as far as I know.

One could just use ``cmake -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_Z3=ON -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_CVC4=ON`` - that works by default already without changing anything (well https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/CMakeLists.txt#L40 would need quotes for that to work, but that's another issue - we should probably change that as well). But I think the ``USE_*`` pattern is better here - let's see what @chfast thinks.

I don't think those actually need to use `if(${Z3_FOUND})` rather just `if(Z3_FOUND)`.

If @chfast does not have anything more to say besides switching `set(CVC4_FOUND "false")` to `set(CVC4_FOUND FALSE)` (and of course the same for Z3), I can commit that change or push force so we can merge this until we find something better?

I forgot that I'm kinda eager to _"fix"_ this, because a few of the team, including myself who use Arch Linux based distributions couldn't build (tag 0.4.24 neither develop branch) until we found what was happening, and that might be the case for a lot of people, since Arch Linux is one of the top-most used Linux distributions.

@mattaereal Yes, please go ahead with the change requested by @chfast (best by force pushing). I'm on archlinux myself, so I'd like to see this merged soon as well :-).

I'll probably have a look into the underlying issue with CVC4 as well today (I think @leonardoalt wanted to look into it, but he's on vacation now, so I'll try to go ahead and fix it - we already had quite a few independent complaints about it).

@mattaereal If you have the time, could you have a look at #4767 and let me know whether that fixes the original build problem on Archlinux with CVC4 (it sounded like that was the issue that motivated this PR)? For me it does.

@ekpyron Sure! I'll check it out. But yeah, this commit was motivated by that issue, so I wanted us to have an opt-out, but that does not fix the problem that is building with CVC4 when the solver is previously installed on Arch Linux.
