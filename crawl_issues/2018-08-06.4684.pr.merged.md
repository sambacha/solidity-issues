# [\#4684 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4684) `merged`: [BREAKING] Underscores in numeric literals

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-08-06 08:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4684):

Closes #1677

Follows https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/

This is a recreation of the PR #3120, that got accidentally closed and couldn't be recovered (easily). My apologies, @Balajiganapathi. I however retained your original commits and will now attempt finishing them.

### Notes

This PR finalizes the original PR #3120. Changes include:
* Shifting validation of underscores as far back as possible (from Lexical analysis to SyntaxChecker) to provide better error diagnostics.
* Adds tests to `tests/libsolidity/syntaxChecker/parsing/`.
* We agreed to keep rules as similar as possible to recent Python, i.e. minimal validation is done, no thus, grouping width is forced neither on decimal nor on hexadecimal.
