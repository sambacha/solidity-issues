## Given code

The example given expects the caller to provide 'index' of `proposalNames` array defined within the contract.

It is **not possible for the external world** to *know* the `index` of an array stored within a contract. Though the list of `proposalNames` are submitted by a caller who is the `chairperson`, it would be **unuserfriendly** for the `chairperson` to publish the `index` of the `proposalNames` along with the proposal Names. Besides, this will force the voter to *pick and remember the index* of the 'proposal Name' for which one wants to vote. This is **unconventional** and a bit tedious too.

## Proposed Update

A ***better solution*** would be to provide the voter and option to ***vote by proposal Name*** itself, instead of *vote by `index`* to the `proposalNames`.

Thank you very much for your contribution, but unfortunately, I am not convinced this will lead to a satisfying solution. People who want to use this contract have to use a UI that does source code verification. Checking constructor arguments is a vital part of source code verification and this is how you get the correlation between index and name. Another way to get the proposal names is to just call `.proposals(index)`.
