Please double check the actual assertion values.

I'm sorry, but I don't want to review this any further before 0.5.0 release.

Rebased and fixed the issue noted. I think this should be safe to merge and would prefer merging it now to give us the 2 weeks time to test it.

Tests fail.

Nvm, it seems in the past month something broke:
```
Compiling ./contracts/token/ERC827/ERC827Token.sol...

InternalCompilerError:
Compilation failed. See above.
```

Will investigate.

It is actually the `link` method, seemingly it is called even when without `compile`.

```
UNCAUGHT EXCEPTION:
- function: "void dev::solidity::CompilerStack::link()"
```

@chriseth I think it is time to revisit this :)
