# [\#4696 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4696) `merged`: Disallow ambiguous implicit and explicit conversions from number literals to bytesXX

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-08-06 14:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4696):

Fixes #3942. Closes #3899.

I considered restricting string literals and hex string literals as well, but dropped the idea, so this is just about decimal and hex number literals.

The reasoning is the following:
  - hex"01234" and "abc" are implicitly of fixed bytes type and as thus can still be converted to longer bytes types.
  - However, hex"01234" and "abc" are not directly explicitly convertible to (u)intXX types, but only through an explicit conversion to a sized bytes type.

This above was already the case and is not changed in this PR.

Changes in this PR:
  - decimal numbers 1234 are implicitly integers and can only be explicitly converted to bytes types through an explicit conversion to a sized integer type.
  - hex numbers 0x1234 are implicitly integers as well, but they *can* be explicitly converted to bytes types directly, *if* they have a matching number of digits (and therefore padding is clear).
  - As an exception both decimal and hex literals with value zero can be explicitly converted to any bytes type.

That's the most consistent concept I have come up with so far.

Probably the external tests will have to be adjusted.

I'm utterly surprised that the external tests seem to pass without any adjustments :).

I'm fine with merging, let's wait for the squashing god's opinion.
