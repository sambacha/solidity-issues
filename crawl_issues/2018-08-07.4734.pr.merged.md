@ekpyron I was wondering if it should be named `functionKind` similarly how `ContractDefinition` has `contractKind`, then that reflects the internal field we have. We do not have such a field for the `FunctionDefinition` AST node, but I think we should.

@axic Yes, I was wondering the same. ``FunctionCall`` has a ``kind`` and ``Literal`` has a ``kind``, though. Not sure whether it's better to change ``contractKind`` to ``kind`` or whether to change the one in this PR to ``functionKind`` (and if the latter whether to change the other ``kind``s as well).

If `kind` instead of `xyzKind` is more common, then lets stick to `kind`.

Well - it's two against one, so *slightly* more common. I tend to stick to ``kind``.

As a second look we have:
- `enum ContractDefinition::ContractKind` and `ContractDefinition::contractKind()` -> AST: `contractKind`
- `enum FunctionCallKind` and `FunctionCallAnnotation::kind` -> AST: `kind`
- `enum ArrayType::ArrayKind` and `ArrayType::arrayKind` -> AST: (not present)
- `enum FunctionType::FunctionKind` and `FunctionType::kind()`

And the `kind` field for `Literal` is specific to the AST JSON, derived from the token type by `ASTJsonConverter::literalTokenKind`.

The ``FunctionType::kind()`` is more low-level, though, and wouldn't be the same as the new ``kind`` we want to introduce here.
Maybe we should discuss the whole JSON AST in a separate issue - not sure whether we should merge PR first or postpone it, resp. close it for now, though.

Moving back to "in progress" as it seems that this still requires discussion.

Moving back to "under review", since the PR is still up to date and we decided to probably just merge it.

We've agreed on a daily call to go with `kind` and perhaps rename `contractKind` in the future.
