Came up in #4691.

The JSON ASTs seem to be scarcely documented in general. Also the test coverage at the moment is far from extensive.

To discuss: who needs the legacy AST? Is it still used? Do we want to or can we stage it for removal in 0.7.0?

Do we need to keep this issue open? Should it be renamed to "improve test coverage of JSON AST"?
