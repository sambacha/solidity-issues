Not sure whether ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` will work here. ``<LANG>`` would be ``CXX`` both for emscripten and gcc/clang/MSVC builds, wouldn't it?

I think it shouldn't be an emscripten specific option. I kind of have the feeling it shouldn't be turned on at all, since we do not have the proper attributes set on exported functions.

That may be - we should investigate this in more detail - I added this to ``0.5.1``, though, since the current workarounds seem to work and therefore I would say it's not "urgent".

@chfast can you shed a light if `<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET` works well cmake?

Never heard of it, but looks promising. Build with make VERBOSE=1 and see the compiler flags.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
