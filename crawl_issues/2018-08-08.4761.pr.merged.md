I think the libsolc part should definitely be merged, but we could argue about the `StandardCompiler` part.

@chriseth I think using the header in C mode shouldn't be a problem - ``extern "C"`` should prevent the ``noexcept`` part to enter into the exported symbol. But maybe we should check.

I think @chriseth refers to the fact that apparently the signature will change with C++117 with noexcept. However currently it seems to be working well, since all the tests (emscripten) passed.
