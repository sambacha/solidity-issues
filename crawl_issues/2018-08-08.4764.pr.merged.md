The version is 8 bytes long plus the CBOR encoding makes it 14 bytes extra data to be added to each contract. Given the deployed code has it plus the creator code, this results in ~4000 gas extra cost on a regular contract.

Need to evaluate whether it is worth it.

Decision: if can make this cost around 2500 gas we merge it, otherwise ignore it for now - can leave the issue and invite opinions from the community.

Proposal: change the 64bit version number into 32bit where the top byte contains a flag: 1. bit means it is a non-release.

This should now pass the tests, it is only a matter of agreeing on the acceptable overhead.

Decision from call:
1) for release version the `solc` key has a `ByteString` value consisting of 3 bytes: major, minor, patch
2) for non-release versions the `solc` key has a `TextString` value consisting of the entire compiler version text

Since the release case cannot be easily tested, perhaps add a script to the release process which validates it.

@chriseth this is becoming ever so more complicated. How do you feel about having a tiny class encode CBOR?

```
class MetadataCBOREncoder
{
        void pushBytes(string const& key, bytes const& value);
        void pushString(string const& key, string const& value);
        void pushBool(string const& key, bool value);
        // Prepends fixed-length map key and the 16 bit length at the end.
        bytes finalise();
}
```

It would need to either make an entire copy in `finalise` or keep the values as a map and serialise them on `finalise`.

@chriseth I'll squash some commits before merge, but it would be ok to review this now.

> Tests are failing.

Haven't updated the expected bytecode in StandardCompiler and the length check in the optimiser ones.

The main test case is `libsolidity/Metadat` which is updated.

Looks good. We should probably create a pull request with `prerelease.txt` present to check the CI.

Todo:
 - remove duplicate code
 - test with `prerelease.txt`

After discussing with @chriseth:
We'll replace the cmdline gas tests with isoltest types to be able to update expectations for release and prerelease simultanously. The standard-json test involving gas estimates will have the gas estimate part removed (although we'll need to consider whether it should be tested in some way nonetheless).

I now adjusted this to allow putting the compiler stack in a "fake release" mode for the gas estimate tests - I think the gas costs in "prerelease mode" are too fragile due to the version itself changing in string length and on top of that the build date being encoded into it, which will regularly change in size as well. And this doesn't merely affect bytecode size, but also changes the deployed code size in the ``codecopy`` command in the constructor bytecode, which might now randomly be stored using different numbers of bytes and possibly involving zero bytes; all of that affecting gas costs. I'd argue that it's more important to test release numbers anyways, so I'd say this is fine.

I simplified the new ``GasTest`` class in the test suite accordingly (in the current version of this PR there's no need to treat creation gas costs specially anymore).

@chriseth Do you think this is reasonable or should I look into reliably calculating the difference between release and prerelease gas costs?

~~This should probably also be documented - I'll do that as well!~~ Done
