Fixes #4673.

### TODO
* [x] create a test case for `fixed8x80 a = -1 / (1e9 ** 10);`
* [x] check if it could also fix #4717.

Does this fix #4717 too?

Please add a changelog entry.

Just to make sure: we *do* want ``fractionalDigits`` to be ``80`` for these "infinitesimal" values, although the actual value ends up being zero anyways, which does not require any fractional digits? Probably it does make sense like this.

I wonder about this, too. The comment says "least precision loss", which hints at using `80` digits.

``@returns the smallest fixed type that can  hold the value or incurs the least precision loss.``
The "smallest fixed type that can hold the value" zero is ``fixed8x0``.
How would one define the "precision loss"? Probably using some error measure like ``abs(value - actual_value)`` or some scaled version of that (like ``abs((value - actual_value) / actual_value)``, if ``actual_value > 0`` - that would be some notion of "relative error"). But that would be the same for any ``fixed8xY`` type, if ``value`` is zero.
So that would hint at ``fixed8x0``.
Independently, an argument for ``fixed8x0`` would be that it may be more obvious that the "actual" fractional part is lost. But I'm not really sure - it still feels like ``fixed8x80`` might makes sense, but I wouldn't know how to actually justify it.

There is no type that can hold the value, `fixed8x0` can only hold the truncated value. If we use `fixed8x80` it at least shows that something was truncated. It also shows that the final value has a distance of at most `1e-80` from the actual value.

Perhaps put differently: If we have to truncate, then the number of digits is as large as possible (so long as the integer part still fits).

Fair enough, that makes sense. We may want to adjust the comment, though.
