The tests are failing due to download issues, not because of the commits. I'm currently testing this on my Arch Linux.

The new library is https://www.ginac.de/CLN/ - that seems to be an optional dependency of CVC4 and linking fails with undefined references to it, since CVC4 seems to require CLN in its default build in Archlinux.

@mattaereal I just changed this PR again, because I somehow garbled the name, but now it indeed seems to work for me on Archlinux.

No problem, building again, will let you know in a few minutes.

It just built the object for the solvers interfaces without an issue, and that's where it was halting, I don't think it will be failing from this point.

Confirmed. Built successful. From all Arch Linux users, thanks!

@ekpyron does the test suite work properly after this change with cvc4 only on your machine?

Now this merge conflicts with #4665 that was about to get merged.

@axic I'll check (haven't checked CVC4 only so far, but it makes sense to do).

As some further explanation for this change:

CVC4 generates a header from https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4/blob/master/src/util/rational.h.in, in which it is hard-coded whether CLN was enabled at build time.
Then in https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4/blob/master/src/util/rational_cln_imp.h it wraps CLN directly in the header, so solidity ends up using CLN and has to link against it.

Is there actually any reason why solidity is linked against ``GMP`` other than CVC4? Because GMP is *not* needed, if CVC4 was built against CLN instead, so if CVC4 is the only reason, we might want to change the logic a bit more.

Yes, following the SMT/CVC4 logic in the CMake files, GMP is also only added, because CVC4 depends on it. I'll change this PR further to work well with both cases (CVC4+GMP and CVC4+CLN).

Just ran `scripts/tests.sh` and did not fail. But I can't remember if that tests for solvers too.

I just added another commit that removes requiring GMP as prerequisite of CVC4, since CVC4 built against CLN doesn't require GMP.

@axic I just ran the tests while disabling Z3 and only enabling CVC4 and they pass.
