# [\#4774 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4774) `closed`: Optimisation: store (large) string literals as auxiliary data and codecopy them

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-08-08 20:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4774):

Currently all strings are broken up into 32 byte items, `PUSH`d and `MSTORE`d.

The helper function [`CompilerUtils::storeStringData`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp#L1181-L1201) is doing this, however it has a fixed rule for only doing it for >128 characters.

It should be exposed to the optimiser (or user) to decide based on cost.
