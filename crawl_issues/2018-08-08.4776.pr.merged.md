# [\#4776 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4776) `merged`: Calculate the dataGas correctly in the constant optimiser

This may cause a wrong decision about cost (and as a result choosing the least efficient code),
but will not cause any miscompilation or invalid output.

Nice find!

I am not sure about this one, we need to properly review where `dataGas` is used (it is used in about 3 places). The code is a bit confusing.

Also worrying that tests are not affected.

We don't have tests about that.

The changes here are minimal:

In all but one case, we have that `_data == toCompactBigEndian(m_value, 1)`, and in this case, it holds that:
`_data.size() == td::max<size_t>(1, dev::bytesRequired(m_value));`, so the code is not a change.

The one situation where it is a change is in `CodeCopyMethod::gasNeeded()`, because it calls `dataGas(toBigEndian(m_value))`, which will encode the number in 32 bytes, regardless of its size.

So `CodeCopyMethod` will get even more expensive (it already was really expensive, because the copy routine is rather long), especially for small numbers and because of that, I think this will not result in different behaviour of the optimizer.
