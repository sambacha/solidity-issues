# [\#4779 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4779) `merged`: Decide better in storing string literals as data

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-08-08 22:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4779):

Fixes #4774.

```
contract C {
  function f() pure public {
    require(false, "This is a short text.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");

    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");
    require(true, "This is a very long text likely to exceed the limit of 32 bytes per push. And more. Really this should exceed it now, finally.");

  }
}
```

Before:
```
Gas estimation:
construction:
   831 + 793800 = 794631
external:
   f():	269
```

After:
```
Gas estimation:
construction:
   399 + 361400 = 361799
external:
   f():	269
```

One must add that storing string literal as data means it can be deduplicated, which is not the case with pushes.

@chriseth updated to use `PathGasMeter`. It changes a bunch of things, but please review the logic in CompilerUtils first.

Let's delay that to 0.5.1

Split off the helper changes into new PRs, those are tiny and prefer to have them merged. This one though fine to be delayed as it should be tested better.

Needs a test.

Another example:
```
contract C{
  function f() public {
    string memory a = "hello world";
    string memory b = "hello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello world";
    string memory c = "hello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello worldhello world";
  }
}
```

@chriseth this should be done, just need to come up with a new metric for the "duplicate contract" test case.

I think we can ignore duplication for now. It is an issue if someone uses a `constant` string, though.

This is tricky to get right and probably not worth it for now.
