Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3944

 - [x] fix all errors
 - [x] check that all code examples actually start with `pragma` - should we have a separate test about that?

The script change looks good.

Yes, sounds good.

Should be all good now.

This now extracts way more code snippets - basically everything that is indented with spaces and has a line that starts with `pragma `, `library `, `contract ` or `interface `. The extraction of course has some false positives, so I had to change some line breaks in the text.

This now especially also matches some snippets in the style guide which is a good side-effect, I would say.

Ready for review.
