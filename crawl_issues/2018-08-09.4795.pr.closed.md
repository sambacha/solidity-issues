Closes #4674.

Very WIP. Please do not merge.

The reason I was building it into a tree was that the opcode stream is inherently tree-like. It's easy enough to do it with a flat list if there is a definite series of opcodes / constants to match, like {1, 1, MUL}, but as soon as there is just a kind of pattern, like match any operation, or match any operation or push constant, then there is no longer a definite length to look for. This means the code wouldn't know how far back to generate an expression for.

The main issue with the current method (that I can think of so far) is that it ignores things like JUMPDEST that don't modify the stack at all. My idea was then going to be to only look at sections with instructions that don't have any side effects, so any proven-correct optimizations could happen regardless of how they modified the stream.

**EDIT:** scratch that just thought of how to do it without a stack

updated to not parse items into a stack

Ah and concerning jumpdest: If you encounter anything that is not a simple operation (perhaps with `dup` being a future exception), you should not continue.

So, instead of just not applying any rules to that expression as a whole, bail out entirely?

@meowingtwurtle Things like `... jumpi push 4 push 5 add ` should still be simplified to `... jumpi push 9`.

But you should not do any analysis on `push 4 jumpdest push 5 add`

That's what the code currently tries to do, although maybe not quite completely. If the expression as a whole contains operations that can't be handled, it tries to optimize each of the arguments to that expression.

In the first example you gave, if the add expression will be optimized and replaced. In the second example, the arguments to add will be parsed as `push 5` and `push 4 jumpdest`. If `push 5` could be optimized, it would. `push 4 jumpdest` as a whole wouldn't be optimized. But, now that I think of it, if `push 4` could be optimized, it should be.

Please try to keep this as simple as possible in the first iteration. If it only applies to very very specific cases, it is still an improvement. The most important part is that it is easy to see that it is perfectly correct. If that is done and working, we can try to extend it to more cases.

@chriseth Just reduced copying by a lot with iterators. Valgrind reports no memory leaks or invalid reads.

There are two reasons that those helpers exist. The first is that they can be implemented in terms of each other and recursively. The second is that they can be used to decompose a larger opcode stream that is fed in. This means that `optimize` can break down an entire opcode stream into its expressions and arguments. Having those functions allows the code to be reused.

@chriseth Made the trivial requested changes (everything requested except explicit shared_ptr usage). I also documented the helper methods, hopefully that should help you and others understand them.

@meowingtwurtle @chriseth when/where did we lose track of this one?

A few things: chriseth believes that the current code in this is too complicated (I somewhat agree, but I'm not sure how much simpler it could be) and this was informally returned to the public (see the discussion on the main issue page).

I'm closing this. I would propose to award half of the bounty to meowingtwurtle for the work he put into this (-> discussion on the issue).
