# [\#4798 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4798) `merged`: Mapping arguments and returns

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-08-10 14:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4798):

Fixes #4670. Fixes #4641.

Related: #4635. 

This is a compound PR now, but I don't think it makes too much sense to split it up, since the changes are highly related (I will split, if anyone disagrees, though).

The code changes are minimal, but we have to be sure that the tests (in particular the semantics tests) are sufficient, so let me know if you have test cases you think I should add.
