# [\#4803 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4803) `closed`: Event overwritten with incompatible one
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following code compiles without warnings, even though `Foo` overwrites the `Approve(address,address)` event with an incompatible one. This should fail to compile because it's not an overloading of `Approve` with a different signature, but a replacement of it with an incompatible one, because of the `indexed`.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract IFoo {
    event Approve(address a, address b);
}
contract Foo is IFoo {
    event Approve(address indexed a, address b);
}
```

@axic do we want to fix this with 0.5.0?

@axic This is inheritance related, since the problem is that the events from the super contract are not propagating. Do we still want it for 0.5.0 or for the Inheritance project?
