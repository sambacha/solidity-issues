# [\#4804 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4804) `closed`: Rethink ``Type::canLiveOutsideStorage``; allow as arguments/return values for internal functions.

Came up in #4798.

``Type::canLiveOutsideStorage`` seems to mainly be used for mappings - we may want to consider removing it and using a shared flag for storage references and mappings instead. Also in ``TypeChecker::visit(FunctionDefinition const& _function)`` we should allow such types as arguments and return values for internal functions in general (currently mappings are allowed explicitly), but we have to recheck whether this requires new tests, etc.

Also, we should better unify mappings and reference types (not through inheritance but perhaps through a shared bool function) - we often have special cases that apply to reference types and to mappings.

The `canLiveOutsideStorage` could be replaced by a function that tells whether the type has a name or not, because we have many weird types (TypeType, MagicType, ``super``, ...) which should not be exposed.

@chriseth https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6282 extends `canLiveOutsideStorage` to Struct.

If you want changes, we should think about it now.
