# [\#4815 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4815) `merged`: multiple inheritance in solidity search from right-to-left, different from python

Below description is confusing for multiple inheritance, because python search from left-to-right, but solidity search from right-to-left. See below

In "inheritance" chapter, it says 
> The general inheritance system is very similar to Python’s, especially concerning multiple inheritance.

But in the following inheritance example 

`contract Final is Base1, Base2 {
} `

It says below
> A call to Final.kill() will call Base2.kill as the most derived override 
> ...
> (note that the final inheritance sequence is – starting with the most derived contract: Final, Base2, Base1, mortal, owned) ...

Thanks for the finding! I took the liberty to explain it in a bit more detail. If you are fine with it, please squash.

@chriseth I am not clear what is "most derived" vs "base like", which seems introducing new concept but not plain explanation as left-to-right or right-to-left

@gftea hm, in contrast, I don't understand what you mean by "left" and "right".

The thing is that C3 linearization is a rather complex topic. My idea is that if you use `contract X is A, B`, then it works if `B` inherits from `A` but not if `A` inherits from `B`, i.e. start with the most base-like.

If you have a better explanation then please go ahead, I would also like to avoid words like "base-like"...

Hi @chriseth 
In example `contract X is A, B {}`, if calling X.kill(), python will search as depth-first, left-to-right, which means it will call A.kill() first not B.kill(), which is opposite of solidity, right?

The python document says below which is more clear, and because we refer to python explanation, then it is better to re-use same way of description. See below

`class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>`

> For most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent class as depth-first, left-to-right, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hierarchy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in DerivedClassName, it is searched for in Base1, then (recursively) in the base classes of Base1, and if it was not found there, it was searched for in Base2, and so on.
> To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents).

@gftea ah nice! I did not know this part of the documentation! That also aligns our two ways of thinking: When I say "derived" I mean "search first" and "base" means "search last", which makes sense if you think of inheritance as overriding (the static approach) and not as "searching" (the dynamic approach).

I will try to overhaul this part.

I noticed that the file already had some details on the difference to python.

What do you think about this one?

@chriseth much better!
