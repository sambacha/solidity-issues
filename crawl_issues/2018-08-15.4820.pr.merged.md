Oh and the struct should be taken from storage.

@chriseth Let's merge this without the json path test and I'll create a separate PR for it.

I think this was working for strings, but not for structs.

Because the actual hashing is in done in `ExpressionCompiler` prior to abi encoding and that should work for strings. Well, it does use the specific "packed encoding" on it. Wonder if that is desired.

As it turned out in #5102 some tests rely on it.
