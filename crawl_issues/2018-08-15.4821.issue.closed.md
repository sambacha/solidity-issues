This is also required for indexed event parameters.

What is still missing here is actually disallowing everything that was not part of abi encoder v1 in `abi.encodePacked` (but not in event parameters). As far as I can tell, this includes:
 - structs
 - nested dynamic arrays
 - maybe nested static arrays
