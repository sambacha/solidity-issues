Not sure - we might already have an issue about this, still wanted to bring it up.

That's a duplicate of #4669, which we decided to move to 0.5.1 before.

I'm still not closing this as duplicate yet, since I guess the idea behind this issue was to discuss it for 0.5.0 again - so I'll leave #4669 in 0.5.1, we can discuss this issue here again for 0.5.0 and then close one as duplicate of the other.

Sorry, no, I did not mean to reopen this for 0.5.0.
