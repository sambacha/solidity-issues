# [\#4829 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4829) `merged`: Add return data to bare calls.

~Depends on #4822.~
Fixes #434.

~This is based on and meant to be merged after #4822 to avoid duplicated effort (i.e. the commits of #4822 are included here as well). Should be rebased on top of develop after #4822 is merged.~

The code changes are done, but this still needs a Changelog entry, documentation updates, more extensive tests and updates to external tests.

Does anybody want to take over from here? I'm not sure whether I'll be able to continue before September.

Note: on pre-byzantium the return type should be "InaccessibleDynamicType" to avoid having a "length" member (see one of @chriseth's outdated comment above).

Please rebase and add end to end tests.

Another useful test would be something that couples `.call` with other operations that allocate memory.

Actually, let me merge this now, the rest can be dealt with in another PR.
