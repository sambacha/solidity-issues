### Checklist

- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

### Description

Clarifies the remapping documentation to make it clearer and less ambiguous. Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1532 where as far as I could tell, there were no real changes to docs proposed, but I personally found them hard to understand, so I hope this PR helps make them easier for others.

@chriseth Squashed, though it wiped history of your specific commit if that's OK.
