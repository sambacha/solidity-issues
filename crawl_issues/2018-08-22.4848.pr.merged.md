### Checklist
- [N/A] Code compiles correctly
- [N/A] All tests are passing
- [N/A] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [N/A] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [N/A] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

### Description

This is only a small documentation fix.

- Data is plural, but 'there are a lot of data' sounds odd to most readers. I used the word information, instead. 'There is a lot of data' isn't grammatical.
- There was an errant space before a comma. I've substituted in a semicolon for readability.

These are small changes, almost pathetically so. But they make the bug report easier to read, thus reducing some friction at scale.
