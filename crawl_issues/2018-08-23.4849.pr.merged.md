I'm kind of confused by the code coverage failing here, can someone point me in the right direction?

Thanks for your contribution! While reviewing, @ekpyron noted that the static objects have to be references to shared pointers, because otherwise `shared_from_this` would not work. In general, we should strive to disallow bare objects of types at all, which is of course out of scope for this PR.

One way to both correct the problem that these objects here have to be shared pointers and go into the direction of disallowing bare objects would be the following:

Instead of a struct containing these static members, add public static functions to the types which have a static local variable of shared pointer type that return a reference to the object.

So it would e.g. be:

```
class IntegerType
{
...
static IntegerType& address() { static shared_ptr<IntegerType> addr(new IntegerType(160, Modifier::Address)); return *addr; }
}
```

Using functions also has the advantage that we get around the static initialization order problem.

I have done your bidding. Let me know what you think.

This looks good, but unfortunately, while you were working on this PR, #4887 was merged, which is now in conflict with this PR - do you think you could rebase this PR and adjust it to these latest changes in ``develop``? Instead of ``IntegerType::address()`` it will now have to be ``AddressType::address()``.

Rebasing will probably also fix the external test runs, which break due to breaking changes in separately merged PRs.

Unfortunately, this will need to be rebased again, if #4911 is merged before it.

It looks like the `AddressType` constructor has a new `StateMutability` parameter. What should I pass in here when creating the shared pointer?

```c++
static AddressType& address() { static std::shared_ptr<AddressType> addr(std::make_shared<AddressType>()); return *addr; }
```

It seems like the `address` function should take the `StateMutability` as a parameter. In that case, what do I pass in when calling `address`?

Please create two functions: One just called `address` with state mutability "nonpayable" and one called `addressPayable` with state mutability 'payable'.

The current code should already have them.

I'm not sure what the test failures are, tests look fine on my machine...oh wait, looks like some package.json versioning issue
