### Description

As mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4615 I think somewhere along the way we might have lost some of the exact details, so it might be that the information isn't completely correct, but we can polish here. I also now wonder if it might be better to move this information to each type instead? Or to the functions explanation?

Rebased and squashed, mixing a few of my changes with those of @chriseth on the way.

@chriseth This feels largely done to me, the large change was moving sections around, and the rest fairly small. Anything obvious you think should be extracted, let me know.

@ChrisChinchilla "largely done" as in "there is nothing left to merge in here" or "can be merged like this"?

@chriseth Can be merged if you're happy with it.

The first part can be merged, but the part "Types as input and output parameters" still needs some changes. I also think that it should go after the mapping section.

OK @chriseth removed that section for a future PR, as this one has sat here for quite long enough :)

I'll add some more code-style changes to the words "storage" and "calldata" and then I'll merge.
