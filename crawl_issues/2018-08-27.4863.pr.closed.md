Can you explain the changes in code generated? If this is just to make the gas estimator happy, I'm not sure we should do that.

It is a fun reason, we went through this with @leonardoalt.

In short: in the old version `label` is swapped a couple of times and the estimator is not able to deduce it is a label due to the swaps. With reordering the code (I must admit I haven't reviewed the final version of the PR) to avoid swaps (as much as we can), while making the generator code more cohesive (subjective I guess), the estimator is also able to pick it up.

Alternatively the estimator could be improved.

The basic idea of this code is to push the jump target right before the jump.
Complementing what @axic said, there are a few `swap`s to organize the stack when the function is `bound`. Since the jump target is currently pushed before `self` (the variable), the Gas Estimator fails to infer the jump target (because of the `swap`s that organize the stack).

@chriseth @leonardoalt can we try to get this into 0.5.1?

@ekpyron @christianparpart @bit-shift can you also review?

I will take another look at this code.

The current code in this PR delays pushing the function label (in `FunctionCall` instead of `MemberAccess`) such that the gas estimator can figure out where to jump to. However, if there is no function call (see file `bound_no_call.sol` in this PR), too many pops are performed at the end, since
-  `a.double` has type `FunctionType` and the `sizeOnStack` of that type is the size of the label + the size of the first parameter.
- the function label was never pushed

Closing in favor of doing it properly with Yul.
