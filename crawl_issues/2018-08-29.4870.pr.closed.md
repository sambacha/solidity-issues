# [\#4870 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4870) `closed`: Fix bug in memory non-value parameter overriding external calldata

Fixes #4832 

Using `interfaceFunctionType` allows us to ignore the `location` for that check.

Calling `interfaceFunctionType` does not feel 100% right here. The purpose of this check is to verify that if two externally visible functions end up with the same interface hash, then one actually overwrites the other, so they are not two different functions. The fact that you force library interfaces does not properly solve it - library interfaces retain more types, but this is rather by accident.

I am not sure how to do this properly because an `external` function cannot directly be overwritten by a public function.

Yea it's tricky. When I and @axic talked about it last week there was also an idea of introducing a new `extendedInterfaceType` for that.

It might be that what we actually want to know is if the external function type is the same, i.e. if `contractName.f` and `baseContractName.f` have the same type.
