# [\#4887 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4887) `merged`: Split IntegerType into IntegerType and AddressType.

As a prerequisite for #4552, ``IntegerType`` is split into ``IntegerType`` and ``AddressType``.
Code generation and SMT checker continue to treat ``AddressType`` in the same way as ``IntegerType(160)``.

Note: the test failure reveals that we missed disallowing conversions between ternary expressions of integer type and addresses, so even though ``address a = 0`` does not work ``address a = false ? 0  : 0`` currently does work.
EDIT: fixed. Due to this I'll add a Changelog entry, even though this was originally intended as a purely internal change.

Why is no change in `RationalNumberType::binaryOperatorResult` needed? Because things like `0 != address(x)` are disallowed?

Why no change in `FixedBytesType::IsExplicitlyConvertibleTo`?

As to ``RationalNumberType::binaryOperatorResult``: I think ``commonType`` between addresses and non-address integers should always have been empty (see comment above), so this should always have excluded addresses anyways.
As for ``FixedBytesType::IsExplicitlyConvertibleTo``: I overlooked that.

Ok, I thought more changes are needed in the code generator, but it seems that it mostly relies on the size functions and does not care about the actual type as long as it is a value type.

Should be squashed before merge.
