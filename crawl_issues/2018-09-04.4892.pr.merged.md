# [\#4892 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4892) `merged`: New docs section on "050 breaking changes"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2018-09-04 10:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4892):

Implements #3761 

This is a list of 050 features based on the Changelog that might require some explanation on how to change the code to compile on 050. I left out the ones that are probably clear from the compiler's message.

The split of ``address`` into ``address`` and ``address payable`` will also need to be included (in progress as #4911).

Fixed suggestions.
Listing topics that I found important separated by suggested types. Each topic has an explanation and how to change the code.

Should we have more and complete code examples for showing how to update the code or how updated code looks like? If so, we can consider adding https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4911#discussion_r216967668.

How much is still left to be done here?

The example that I just added was the last thing. Now fixing the new suggestions.

But aren't there way more changes like `var` and stuff?

Yes, the changes in the example are the ones mentioned in that docs section. Should the example contain more of the changes?

I feel like if we add all (or most of) the changes in the example it gets too massive.

Almost there! Let's perhaps go over it together later.
