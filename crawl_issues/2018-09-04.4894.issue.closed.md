Yes! Try to split it into logical chunks and come up with god names for the functions :)
Perhaps start with a very very simple change first so we have room for discussion.

I think this function can be separated based on the FunctionCall types.

should be separated based on the health condition/type requirement rules of a function call.
The hard part is to summarize the rules from the code.

I think the calculation for isPure can stay in the main function. I will do a draft version first.

Since someone is working on it, I will work on another issue.
@Meshugah There are some ideas that might be useful for you.
I think the steps 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 are large enough for functions.

@Meshugah just run `isoltest.sh`, it should cover pretty much everything. Please submit a pull request - it is advisable to even do that without running the tests in this case.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1409883?u=1f49863b1110007dee59da22e445c97f4cb93ffc&v=4" width="50">[liangdzou](https://github.com/liangdzou) commented at [2018-09-18 13:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4894#issuecomment-422399246):

I usually run "build/test/tools/isoltest". I think it is somehow the same as @chriseth said. Sometimes, I also run solidity/test/cmdlineTests.sh. When you submit a PR, there will be an online test. You will find out what tests are important for you.

These users each claimed they can complete the work by 8 months, 3 weeks from now.

**1) [svenski123](https://gitcoin.co/profile/svenski123) has been approved to start work.**

Hi - I'd like to pick this up if it's still available.

General approach would be to separate out logic that visits/accepts the FunctionCall child nodes and sets the annotation members (isPure, kind, type) from logic that just does syntax checking / error message generation.

There is also a clear split between type conversions and struct constructor/function calls so that is a good separation point as well.

Learn more [on the Gitcoin Issue Details page](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/4894/1201).


**2) [liangdzou](https://gitcoin.co/profile/liangdzou) has applied to start work _(Funders only: [approve worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/4894/1201?mutate_worker_action=approve&worker=liangdzou) | [reject worker](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ethereum/solidity/4894/1201?mutate_worker_action=reject&worker=liangdzou))_.**

Current order:

1. calculate isPure and argument type from arguments (update annotation for positional call)
2. call expression type checker
3. calculate function call kind (type conversion, struct construction, or function call)
4. check for type conversion (returned in this branch)
5. calculate isPure and membersRemovedForStructConstructor.
6. calculate function type and do some related check
7. check padding for literal
8. argument checker
9. return type checker

I think we can put the isPure calculation together after function call kind calculation and before type conversion check. Other functionalities should be separated easily.

I've submitted pull request #5275, please kindly review.

I've tried to separate AST descent and annotation logic from the checking/message generation logic, as the latter is a bit kitchen sink (i.e. the deprecated function call checks (sha3/keccak256), the VM implementation dependent checks (staticcall).

The ABIDecode logic could also be factored a bit but it was already in a separate method and thus out of scope.
