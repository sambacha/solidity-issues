This might warrant an intermediate bugfix release.

We should also add a regex, which could maybe just be `**`, but should exclude `/**`

Ah nice, the buglist regex test found a fatal flaw in my original regex :)

Should be ready for final review.

Added another test and reduced severity to "medium/high" after the observation that cleanup is properly performed if the type of the base is wider than the type of the exponent.

@chriseth:

For those of us who haven't yet switched to version 0.4.25, where this problem is supposed to be resolved:

The bug description in your [release blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/09/13/solidity-bugfix-release/), implies that if either the base or the exponent is/are 256 bits, then the operation is "safe".

Am I right to conclude this implication?

I have based it on the following statement (from the blog):

> the exponent of the `**` operator has a type that is shorter than 256 bits, but not shorter than the type of the base

Thanks

If both types are 256 bit, then cleanup is a no-op, so it is safe to skip cleanup.

If one of the two operands has less than 256 bits but the other has 256 bits, then the combined type is a 256-bit integer. The operand that already has 256 bits cannot be "dirty" as explained above. The other operand has to be converted to a 256 bit integer. Cleanup is always done when an interger type is converted to a longer type, so the higher order bits of that operand are properly cleaned.

Conclusion: If either the base or the exponent has 256 bits (or both), the bug is not present.
