# [\#4910 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4910) `open`: Add .exists() and .iscontract() on to the address type
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

Not fully sure yet if `.exists()` can be implemented properly, but `.iscontract()` should be possible to be implemented via the `extcodesize` instruction.

With having `.iscontract()`, #4823 would not need to be implemented.

What would be the semantics of `.exists()`?

`.exists()` probably should be postponed until there is a consensus on what that means in Ethereum, however when looking at the account cleanup rules during creation/selfdestruct/etc. should be a good indication.

I actually don't think this can be done properly without support form a new EVM opcode, because one could check for balance and code size, but cannot check for storage, which is possible to be non-empty if the account is only used through delegatecalls.

I would be cautious of any implementation of `.iscontract()` -- the whole idea of testing `iscontract` has led to lots of contracts vulnerable to exploits done by constructors

Actually it seems that `.iscontract()` could be implemented by just using `extcodehash`.

`.exists()` can be clearly implemented post Constantinople, because [EIP-1052](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1052) for `EXTCODEHASH` clearly defines it:
> In case the account does not exist or is empty (as defined by EIP-161) 0 is pushed to the stack.

From [EIP-161](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-161):
> An account is considered empty when it has no code and zero nonce and zero balance.

Similarly `.iscontract()` is clearly defined with EIP-1052:
> In case the account does not have code the keccak256 hash of empty data (i.e. c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470) is pushed to the stack.

@frangio @wadeAlexC any change of view since these are provided by opcodes now?

Since `EXTCODEHASH` returns a nonzero value during the constructor, this seems fine on the surface.

I don't think that really mitigates the vulnerabilities that can arise from using `.isContract()`, because an account can pass the `EXTCODEHASH` test but still become a contract in the future.

We do have an `isContract` function in OpenZeppelin though, because some ERCs require using it. So I think I would be okay with including it in Solidity. But it needs to be used carefully.

Would calling it `hasCode` help in any way?

Are we making commitments in the language that a property of an account in the state cannot ever change? :wink:

@frangio Could you elaborate this sentence?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

This would become very useful in conjunction with https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8838

On non-EOF targets it could fallback to extcodesize/extcodehash.
