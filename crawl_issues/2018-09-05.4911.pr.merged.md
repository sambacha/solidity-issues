~Depends on #4887.~ (merged; rebased)
~Depends on #4926.~ (merged; rebased)
~Depends on ethereum/solc-js#250.~ (merged)
~Depends on axic/openzeppelin-solidity#15~ (merged)
~Depends on #4953.~ (merged)

Implements #4552.

- [x] ~``grammar.txt`` needs to be changed.~ (Moved to #4926)
- [x] Should probably add fields to the JSON AST.
- [x] Needs more test cases (tuple declarations, return parameters, etc.).
- [x] Compilation tests need to be fixed.
- [x] ~``abi.decode(data, (address payable))`` probably doesn't work yet. Should it or should it always return payable addresses with ``(address)``?~ Always returns ``address payable`` now.
- [x] Check behavior of mappings + address.
- [x] Have a look at arrays of address.
- [x] More tests for ``address payable constant`` and ``address constant``
- [x] Semantics tests for conversions and cleanup.
- [x] ~Should ``<address>.send`` only be present in ``address payable`` as well?~ Decision: move ``send`` to ``address payable`` as well.
- [x] External tests need to be fixed. (Already there on separate branches; PRs open).
- [ ]  Probably still needs documentation updates. Update: Now there are some documentation updates => recheck.
- [ ] Have a look at inheritance and overloading with ``address`` and ``address payable`` (overloading has test cases; to be discussed)
- [ ] Think about the return type for ``ecrecover``.
- [ ] Think about whether the large JSON AST test is really needed or whether a simpler one suffices.

As far as `abi.decode` is concerned, I think it is fine for now to just return `address payable` for `(address)`.

I'm pretty sure, we have to make this a change to the parser for the type name and not just the variable declaration. It might seem similar to the storage / memory specifiers, the difference is that you cannot mix storage and memory types, it always applies to the full type. If you only attribute 'payable' to the variable declaration instead of the type name itself, you will not be able to talk about things like `address payable[] x` or `mapping(address payable => address payable)`.

~I changed the external tests back to their default 0.5.0 branches, so they will fail again until the respective PRs are merged.~

Fuzzer test failure tracked in #4948.

Just throwing this out there before 0.5.0 is finalized - might this actually be more appropriately named `address spendable`, as `payable` allows functions to accept `msg.value`, whereas this allows for `msg.value` to be set?

@0age ``address payable x`` basically means that the contract ``x`` can *receive* value, just as ``function f() payable`` means that the function ``f`` can receive value, so I think the naming is fine.

Ah, I see - thanks for clearing that up!
