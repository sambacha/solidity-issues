# [\#4912 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4912) `merged`: Fix bugs in comments.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-05 20:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4912):

 This fixes several bugs with regards to line breaks and comments:

 - any unicode line break (line feed, vertical tab, form feed, carriage
   return, NEL, LS and PS) is considered to terminate a single-line
   comment. The line break itself is considered to be the next token
   after the comment, leading to a parser error if it is not an
   ascii character (i.e. for NEL, LS and PS).
 - unterminated multiline comments are considered illegal tokens
 - '/** /' is considered an unterminated multiline comment
   (previously, whitespace was allowed before the last '/'

Fixes #4885 

To do:

 - [x] changelog entry
 - [x] tests
