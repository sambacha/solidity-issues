Document why importing from parent path would be problematic with regards to reproducibility and the fact that we do not want to publish a global path from the local machine in the metadata.

Provide ways to mitigate the issue (e.g. using remappings or --allow-paths).

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
