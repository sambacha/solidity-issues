# [\#4916 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4916) `merged`: Include origin filename in the filenames generated by isolate_tests.py

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-09-06 09:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4916):

Fixing failures in extracted source snippets in the command line tests is much easier, if ``isolate_tests.py`` includes the name of the file that contained the snippet in its output filenames.

Please recheck that this doesn't interfere with any other usage of ``isolate_tests.py`` apart from in ``test/cmdlineTests.sh``.

This seems to lead to a different order in the bytecode comparison uploads

windows performs ascii comparison, emscripten seems to ignore case and separating characters:

Still not sure whether the last change will solve the bytecode comparison issue. I'll continue to work on the address split for now and get back to this later.

I wouldn't be aware of any further problems this could cause for bytecode comparison now.
