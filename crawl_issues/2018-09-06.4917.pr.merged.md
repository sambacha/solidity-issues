# [\#4917 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4917) `merged`: Parser cleanup.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-09-06 12:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4917):

Came up during #4911.

Most parser functions are of the form ``parse*()``. They take no arguments, but instead use ``m_scanner->currentToken()``, they assert that this token is valid and they call ``m_scanner->next()`` inside the body.

However, this schema is not always adhered to, which is fixed in this PR.
