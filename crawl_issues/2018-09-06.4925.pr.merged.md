Minor documentation issue to improve reading flow as it goes from talking about a specified number of 32-byte slots being reserved to giving numbers which refer to byte ranges within the space of memory resulting from the union of those slots.

Can you squash the two commits, please?

Not super easily, at this time.  Do you have a [Squash and Merge option](https://blog.github.com/2016-04-01-squash-your-commits/) when merging (after approved review)?
