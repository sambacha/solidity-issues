# [\#4926 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4926) `merged`: Accept ``address payable`` during parsing.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-09-06 17:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4926):

Prerequisite of #4911.

Merely allows the ``address payable`` type during parsing and extends ``ElementaryTypeName`` in the AST without actually changing the type system.

With this merged it should be possible to merge all documentation, compilation tests and external test updates that will arise during #4911 before #4911 itself without causing issues. (This will avoid the problems we had with #4829).

The compilation error (the value part of the empty ``boost::optional`` maybe being used uninitialized) is actually the fault of boost, resp. a false positive in gcc's warning detection - so maybe we shouldn't use ``boost::optional`` or not use ``-Wmaybe-uninitialized``...
Let's see whether ``make_optional`` solves the issue.

Please add a test that uses `address payable` together with function types.

@chriseth added ``syntaxTests/parsing/address_payable_function_type.sol``.
