### Description
Please explain the changes you made here.

The library option is never used by the assembler in Solidity. So, we do not need to parse it if the user only wants to call the assembler.

This PR delay the parse for library option after the assembler code.

Thank you for your help!

Eventually, we have to support libraries in assembly mode, so I think this should still stay here. What is the benefit of moving it after the assembly block?

I thought assembly mode is designed to compile it to binary code without replacing the library placeholders, i.e. the thing should be supported by linking. Usually, assembler should be a separate pass with linking. However, this depends on what is an assembler in Solidity. Somehow, I guess this assembler and the linker are different from the ones we usually used in C++.

I think this PR can be closed then.

They are different passes, but the `solc` binary supports running multiple passes at the same time. You can start from source and go all the way down to linked binary. You can start from assembly and go to fully linked bytecode or you can start from source and just go to assembly.
