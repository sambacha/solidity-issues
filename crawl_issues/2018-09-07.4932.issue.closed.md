Geth is not able to run the tests. This is tracked in #2626.

Note that aleth has releases, which include MacOS binaries. I suggest to check them out.

The 1.4.x version line should be able to run the tests: https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/releases/tag/v1.4.0rc6

Sorry I've misread it for MacOS. Have you considered opening an issue on aleth listing what is the problem compiling it on Windows?
