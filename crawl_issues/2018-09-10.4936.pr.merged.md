# [\#4936 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4936) `merged`: Binary search for dispatch.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-10 10:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4936):

Performs a binary search in the dispatch routine if it is beneficial. Takes the "runs" parameter of the optimizer into account, even if the optimizer is not activated.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4034

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5605

It could be worth to calculate the code size cost and the average gas cost for calls to determine the minimum number of calls after which the binary search pays off for different cutoff values... but in general, this is a nice change.

Missing changelog entry.

Can we add two test cases:
- With 7 external functions
- With 16 external functions. Should check that at least 3 `GT` instructions exists in the output?

Let's delay this until 0.5.1

The medium-sized contract in the test vector had the following gas costs before this change:
```
construction:
   411 + 373400 = 373811
external:
   a():	410
   b(uint256):	923
   f1(uint256):	40758
   f2(uint256):	20788
   f3(uint256):	20832
   g0(uint256):	390
   g7(uint256):	20698
   g8(uint256):	20676
   g9(uint256):	20632
```

The functions had an average gas cost of 16234 gas.

With this change and the default setting of 200 runs, the average gas cost is 16207, i.e. 24 gas less. This amounts to 200 * 24 = 4800 gas over the lifetime of the contract. Compared to an increase of 3200 gas for deployment.
