### Description

This PR fixes the issue #4741 by trying to give more information for too long lines.
Basically, the solution gives at most 35 chars before and after the string we want to print if the line is too long. The previous solution simply prints the string out which is lack of the context of the problem we want to show to a user.

This PR is tested with 4 possible situations, i.e. no side, left side, right side, or both sides are shorter than 35 chars. Two more edge tests are also added to test that it prints "..." when the corresponding edge has more than 35 chars.

If there is nothing follows, we will not print the " ... ", see the test case too_long_line_right_short.sol and its reference. Also, boundary tests are also included to test the cases have 35 and 36 chars before and after the "thing" we want to print.

@chriseth if you mean the case "too_long_line_edge_out.sol.ref", this case is intentionally designed to have 36 chars on the right-hand side. So, there is one "{" replaced by " ... ".

Looks fine to me now - for the edge cases one could have considered to only replace with `` ...``, if `` ...`` is in fact shorter than without the replacement (i.e. not replace the ``{`` in the edge case, but only replace, if it's more than four characters longer than the threshold), but I'm fine with it as it is as well.

Could you please squash this into a single commit? Then it can be merged. Thanks a lot!

@chriseth it is now squashed into one commit :-)

@ekpyron I have squashed the commit together according to @chriseth 's requirement. :-)

Could these not be covered by syntax tests?

@axic I added at least 8 cases for this PR

I mean by the syntax tests harness and not via the newly added CLI tests.

@axic no, the syntax tests only check the message itself, not the source reference.
