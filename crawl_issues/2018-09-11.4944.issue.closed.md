# [\#4944 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4944) `closed`: Yul code generator / transform that can re-use stack slots

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-11 08:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4944):

As a precursor to other optimization techniques, we need a code generator for yul that can handle the load of many local variables (e.g. those generated via transformation to SSA). Currently, variables are assigned to a stack slot in a fixed way from the point on where the variable is declared until the end of the block. This is very helpful for debugging, but can lead to "out of stack" problems or just excessive DUP/SWAP instructions.

As an optional setting, EVMCodeTransform should be able to reuse stack slots of variables which will not be used anymore. The strategy could be as follows:

In each `operator()(Assignment`, the code transform determines the deepest stack slot that is currently used by a variable that will not be referenced anymore. The component will perform a matching `swap` instruction followed by a `pop` and update the internal assignments from variables to slots. Furthermore, after each statement, the transform checks whether the topmost stack element is still in use and pops it if not.

Note that this can only be used for "strict yul", i.e. if `StackAssignment` operations are not allowed (this one can then obviously be skipped).

Perhaps this would be something for you, @liangdzou ?

I have several questions about this issue:
1. the pass "Unused Definition Pruner" will remove useless assignments if it can move to the next assignment for the same variable. Can we regard this requirement as a special case of that? That is, when an assignment can move to the end of the function, we should also remove the assignment. Then, the last reference of a variable will always be a read which is very reasonable according to the common sense. The new pass should be created based on this assumption and then remove the variable by swap pop after the last read. @chriseth @ekpyron what do you think? (I am not sure if I understood the problem here. Forgive me in case that I am wasting your time here :-))
2.  I have not seen UnusedPruner been called anywhere except the test files. Is this supposed to be so? I grepped from the whole source file and it seems not used anywhere. I was planning to insert this pass after the pass UnusedPruner, so, I need to know where is it called.
Thanks for your time and patients. :-)

Optimally converting SSA variables to a stack VM  is a problem that has been bugging me for a while. It seems like something thing that would have been well studied in CS literature. Especially considering the Java VM is stack based and has received a ton of research.

What I found so far is the Treegraph algorithm from "Treegraph-based Instruction Scheduling for Stack-based Virtual Machines" (Park et al. 2011) [paper][paper] [presentation][presentation].

AFAIK their results are optimal in the sense that no SWAPs are performed.

I'm not sure if operator commutativity is taken into account when creating the topological sorts, this could be an interesting extension of the algorithm.

@Recmo Cite from the paper, "Instead of saving a multiply-used value in a temporary, our method keeps all values on the stack, which avoids costly store and load instructions."

So, it seems the algorithm avoids load/store from memory. But the work here is to reuse stack slot according to variables' lifetime.

That citation is a comparison to a different strategy where variables are allocated memory slots that need to be load/stored from. Solidity doesn't use this strategy so the quote is not relevant here.

The algorithm itself has little to do with load/store elimination, it's all about optimally scheduling operations on a stack machine. The presentation is

Ah, that paper indeed seems very relevant here!
Still, I think we should first implement the straightforward way. Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5375 to track the treegraph algorithm.
