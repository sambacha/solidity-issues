Once we are in SSA/3AC, the fact whether instructions inside a basic block can be reordered can be determined by just looking at the function calls of the instructions themselves.

If we keep track of memory and storage writes, we can rematerialize storage reads (and perhaps also memory reads). After that, subsequent storage writes to the same location can be reduced to just a single write.

Example:
```
sstore(x, and(y, 0xff))
let z := sload(x)
sstore(x, or(z, and(t, 0xff00)))
```
SSA / 3AC:
```
let t1 := and(y, 0xff)
sstore(x, t1)
let z := sload(x)
let t2 := and(t, 0xff00)
let t3 := or(z, t2)
sstore(x, t3)
```
rematerialize storage read:
```
let t1 := and(y, 0xff)
sstore(x, t1)
let z := t1
let t2 := and(t, 0xff00)
let t3 := or(z, t2)
sstore(x, t3)
```
reorder (put all sstore at the end):
```
let t1 := and(y, 0xff)
let z := t1
let t2 := and(t, 0xff00)
let t3 := or(z, t2)
sstore(x, t1)
sstore(x, t3)
```
eliminate redundant sstores:
```
let t1 := and(y, 0xff)
let z := t1
let t2 := and(t, 0xff00)
let t3 := or(z, t2)
sstore(x, t3)
```
undo SSA (basically just inline all expressions and remove unused variables):
```
sstore(x, or(and(y, 0xff), and(t, 0xff00)))
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
