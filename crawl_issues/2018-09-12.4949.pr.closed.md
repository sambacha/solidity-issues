### Description

~~Fixes~~ Partial fix for #4538 

The problem in short: Unsupported variables were not added to `m_variables` but the visitor callbacks expected it to be there.

The solution: Always define the variables, if it's unsupported use a fallback type (uint256)

Opening the PR for code review, then I can add the tests and changelog (if that is okay)

Hi @hackaugusto , thanks for the contribution!

I was wondering, does it also fix #4537 #4564 #4566 ?

@hackaugusto test failures seem to be irrelevant, but can you please rebase this?

Not really

I think when the test is added this PR is good to go.
Fallback expressions and assignments are still needed to make `MerkleProof.sol` stop crashing, but those should be added in different PRs.

So this PR shouldn't close #4538 or at least the crash will be gone and will be replaced with an unsupported feature message?

There's still an assertion fail, though it's a different crash from #4538

@leonardoalt added a regression test, there are a few drawbacks with this test though:

- It doesn't test the fallback type directly, it relies on `bytes32` not being supported, so, once support is added the test will not make much sense for the fallback type (but it should still be a useful as a regression test)
- It just asserts that the run is successful, without considering the warning messages, this could be useful to detect once support is added to `bytes32`, the test would have to be changed to a new type that is not supported. The problem is that eventually all types should be supported and either the feature would have to be removed or a new test type would be needed.
- [edit 2] The test is a minimal failing version of the original smart contract, which did not catch all bugs of the original.

edit: is a changelog entry required for this one?

@leonardoalt apart from a rebase, are all the questions addressed here?

@axic I'm not sure what happens when rebasing this PR. I refactored how Solidity types are encoded into SMT sorts, so we'd have to see how the code fits together.

@hackaugusto @leonardoalt most of the relevant refactoring has been merged. It would be a good time checking this PR.

I think the current SMT refactor changes so many things that this PR would have to be rewritten. Also, the functionality given here is present in parts of the refactor.

Can you close it then?  It is a shame it wasn't addressed in time, but @hackaugusto your contribution is very much appreciated.

Yes, unfortunately closing seems the reasonable option.
