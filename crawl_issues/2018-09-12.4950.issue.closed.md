Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4911#discussion_r216670998.

In the ABI specification there should be a separate section explaining how solidity types are mapped to ABI types, instead of mentioning it "inline".
This section should include the fact that ``address payable`` is mapped to ``address`` in the ABI.
