# [\#4951 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4951) `merged`: Use current aleth release for testing.

In case we decide these changes are valid, we need to create a new solidity tester release of aleth before merging.

I created  #4968 as a backwards-compatible fix. After that we should consider updating solidity tester with this PR, so that we can remove the polling.

Hm - I think we're getting very few, but random test failures on circleci...
(I changed the aleth version used for the tests to 1.4.0rc6 to see what happens)

Yes, it seems like every test run on circleci fails in a different pass with one or two test cases, in which some call that is expected to return data, doesn't return anything - but it's different test cases each time.

This is really weird. I adjusted this PR so that it checks for the block number and just continues with the old code if the block number is still wrong. I still get some failures. This means that there is still a bug in aleth, it seems. @gumb0 @chfast

Oh and I also added some debug output: the `recv` call on the socket always immediately returns with the correct data (i.e. is blocking) and also the check whether we have the right block after mining is always successful. Still, there are test failures, i.e. the returned data is wrong in some cases.

Ah, actually, no, it is even weirder: The return value of a function call is retrieved using `eth_call`. aleth returns the zero byte array, even though a previous call to check that there is code at the address succeeded. So this is unrelated to mining and unrelated to any race conditions.

@chriseth If this reproduces reliably on specific tests, can you name me one such test?

I tried `SolidityEndToEndTest/gaslimit`, it fails for me locally, but result from `eth_call` is not empty, so it might be something else.

This is worrying `auction_bidding - SolidityAuctionRegistrar`

```
ASSERTION FAILURE:
- file   : RPCSession.cpp
- line   : 334
- message: Error on JSON-RPC call: INTERNAL_ERROR:

In others there are expectation differences.

@axic The failures are not about specific test cases - the RPC interface just fails to work and returns zeros for a random few tests (at least that's my best guess so far) - if you retrigger the CI run it will be different tests that fail.

I just rebased this to verify that different test cases fail.

@gumb0 I think the ``gaslimit`` test may actually be a different issue, since it seems to (not sure yet) deterministically fail with a fixed wrong return value, so I would ignore that test case for now (and fix it later).
The main problem is that there are random test failures in the other tests, at least partly because of empty RPC responses.

I was able to reproduce empty result from `eth_call` with Release aleth build, looks like `test_mineBlocks` returns a bit earlier than it should; and also sometimes it might mine more than requested. I'll think how to fix it.

Also I see something fishy going on when `SolidityAuctionRegistrar/auction_bidding` calls `test_modifyTimestamp` (assertion failures in debug aleth), and also `gaslimit` fails for me as I said.

I'd prefer this to be checked on your side before merging.

Also `gaslimit` is still failing for me, I don't know why.

You can push any tag starting with `v[0-9]` to publish a build.

With the minefix release we're indeed down to the gaslimit failure (which seems to be a separate issue).

Rebasing seems to have exposed a new issue in the gas estimation. Our gas meter seems to be wrong for constantinople and/or aleth does something different in calculating gasUsed for constantinople now.

EDIT (some random debug notes):
``updating_store`` test for < constantinople:
  ``Transaction cost: 59632 bytecode size: 53 meter.estimateMax: 30108``
``updating_store`` test for = constantinople:
  ``Transaction cost: 59696 bytecode size: 53 meter.estimateMax: 30108``
Maybe once ``txDataZeroGas`` vs ``txDataNonZeroGas`` for the transaction cost (the generated bytecode is different for different EVM versions after all).


For ``< constantinople`` our GasMeter and aleth's reported "gas used" are the same.

However: for ``constantinople``, ``aleth``'s reported gas used differs , i.e. aleth reports ``90804`` instead of our estimate ``100404`` for deploying a contract with the following bytecode on constantinople:

BYTECODE: 6080604052348015600f57600080fd5b5060016000819055506002600081905550600060018190555060358060356000396000f3fe6080604052600080fdfea165627a7a72305820e4cb7bfd9ef866a258c9eae3ca781d2c592cd05befdb6b80c75ea1dfeb86f3cf0029
