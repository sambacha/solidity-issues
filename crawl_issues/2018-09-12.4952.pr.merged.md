My remaining question from the original issue discussion is around retrieval. And there are a lot of SO threads on the same topic, so I'd love to get this clear.

I'd like to include an example of a topic structure and then update the JavaScript example to show retrieving an actual (non-hashed) value, and/or link to an example in the web3.js docs if one exists.

Around that example I will add something like what @chriseth said:

> The low-level effect of calling an event is that a so-called log is created. Indexed arguments are stored in the "topic" field of a log. This field is put inside a bloom filter (a special kind of database index) which in turn means that it is rather fast to search for the value if you know it, but it is impossible to retrieve the value. Non-indexed argumenst are stored in the data part of the log which can be retrieved later. In addition to that, strings and bytes are stored by hash inside the topic field.

So that people understand what's happening behind the scenes.

@mancze I clarified a couple of things, and actually, your comments helped me understand even more. I didn't add the link to `abi-spec.html#events` as you suggested, as it's already added a few lines above.

Do you think the examples need updating, or are they OK as is?

@ChrisChinchilla Example seem fine, yet in its JavaScript part there is this part:

>    // result will contain various information
>    // including the arguments given to the `Deposit`
>    // call.

I would prefer to use "non-indexed arguments" and possibly add "and topics". 

In addition one might wonder what various information actually is. It would be nice to have actual log output placed as a comment (leaving out irrelevant properties).

OK @mancze I added some of your comments from above, hopefully, it enough. I was conscious of this doc including too much web3 code as that can get out of date. If you like this I'll get it reviewed and hopefully merged.

I think this should also clarify better what can be done with topics and what can not be done with topics. @ChrisChinchilla please ask Andrei to clarify.

Basically the logs can be searched by their topics and you can receive notifications about the new logs with chosen topics, not sure what else I can tell.

@gumb0 basically the question is whether it is impossible to retrieve the topic (for example because only its hash is stored on because it is only stored in a bloom filter together with other values) or ont.

It is possible, topics are stored, bloom filters are just additional data structure to make filtering fast.
See https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#returns-42 - `eth_getFilterChanges` returns array of topics.

Thanks @gumb0 I think i'm starting to understand, but any chance you can link a code example maybe? Might help me fully understand :)

@ChrisChinchilla I don't have any dapp code to show, but I have this link that explains a lot about events I think https://blog.qtum.org/how-solidity-events-are-implemented-diving-into-the-ethereum-vm-part-6-30e07b3037b9

@gumb0 I tried to incorporate the sections I thought were relevant of that (excellent) post into the docs to cover, mostly regarding filtering with a topic. It ended up being a small change, but could you see if what I added makes sense to you or not? And anything else you found that you think is worth mentioning?

After struggling for a good while to understand the "indexed" thing, some random answer in Stack Overflow mentioned bloom filters and suddenly everything made sense. Came here to suggest this to should be mentioned in the docs, and found that it seemed to be in its way... but got lost?

To summarize: I'm currently learning Solidity, and the events/logging docs are still pretty obtuse/abstract IMO. Maybe mentioning bloom filters would not help a huge percentage of the population, but I see here lots of different wordings which would be big improvements anyway.

Thanks @hmijail I will try to get back to re-reviewing this, but in the meantime, if you have anything to add that you think will improve the current docs, please create a PR and we can have some further discussion in that :)
