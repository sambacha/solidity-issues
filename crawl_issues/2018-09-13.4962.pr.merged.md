### Description
Please explain the changes you made here.
Removed default case from "ExpressionCompiler::visit(FunctionCall...)".
Couldn't remove default case from few other places due to compilation error, hence didn't investigate further.

Let me know if I need to look at those default cases as well.
Thank you for your help!

Please try to look a bit harder, there is at least one more in the same file.

Yes, will take a better look at coming weekend. As far as I remember, I couldn't find any other default case, wherein code compiled without error after removal of it.

Please also find switches where removing the default and adding 2-5 other empty cases would make it compile.

@chriseth , did you mean `case '':` for empty cases. Else suggest what you meant by **empty cases**.

In `ExpressionCompiler.cpp`, we have 12 default cases, I tried all of them but we can't remove default case without compiler error for 11 of them. For 1 default case which is part of this PR, we are getting build issue at circleci but not at commandline.

So in short, I couldn't find any default case to be removed in `ExpressionCompiler.cpp`.

I meant cases without body.

> I meant cases without body.

Just to analyse the previous fix which worked seamlessly.
I went through the fixes in `Types.cpp` in detail and found that in all the 3 instances, switch case had all the possible enum values and extra default case. That's why it was easier to remove them without any compilation issue.

In general, 
For a switch case we need to have all related enum values to be handled as a separate case or through a default case, else it results in an error. 

So, I don't think removing default and adding empty cases will work, as it would miss few enum values resulting in an error.

However, I find default cases in few other files which could be removed, hence updated those files and added to this PR.
