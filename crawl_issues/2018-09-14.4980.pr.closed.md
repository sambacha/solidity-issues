Hello, this PR aims to fix #4061 at parsing time.

I've looked over #4064, and found that the checks were added at AST level. It will cause invalid fixed point types like `ufixed8x4` to fail (as an std::exception) at `FixedPointType` constructor.

I think that in addition to the checks added by #4064, we should also generate error messages for invalid fixed point types (eg.`ufixed8x4`) similar to invalid integer types (eg. `uint12`).

```
test.sol:3:5: Error: Identifier not found or not unique.
    uint12 a; a;
    ^----^
test.sol:3:5: Error: Identifier not found or not unique.
    ufixed8x4 b = 0.1234; b;
    ^--------^
```

Thanks in advance for any comments.

I've checked #4765 but have no idea why the test `too_small_negative_numbers` was expected to pass previously.

The current error message is weird but I think it's better than no error.
```
TypeError: (31-38): Type rational_const -1 / 1000...(93 digits omitted)...0000 is not implicitly convertible to expected type fixed256x76. Try converting to type fixed8x80 or use an explicit conversion.
```
Any suggestions about this test case?

@axic could you take a look here, please?

In my opinion, we don't really need this restriction at all. What is the idea behind wanting `1` to be part of the value range of a type?

Ah, this issue again. This question has been asked and answered in the primary fixed point PR #3389. It was determined that 1 does not need to be in the range of the type for the type to be valid.

Thanks! Closing then.
