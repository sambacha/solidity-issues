### Description

Added missing index items as noted in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1212

To me there seemed enough already covering `new`, but nothing covering `module`. I feel like module as a concept needs a better explanation, but I'll create a different issue for that.

Probably better to improve the beginning of "Importing other Source Files" and then link it there.
