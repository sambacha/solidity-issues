# [\#4983 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4983) `merged`: Fix weird Optimizer Emscripten Bug

Fixes: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4162

Opening this PR to have circle generate ``soljson.js`` to verify that this change indeed fixes the optimizer emscripten bug reported for Archlinux's ``chromium 67.0.3396.99``.

In any case, this "solution" won't help too much, since we won't be able to tell, when this might happen again after adding more rules or whether it's still happening for other browsers, etc...

It's probably some kind of stack size issue, but we'll have to find out exactly which limitation is violated in which way to properly deal with this.

Indeed, the generated ``soljson.js`` works for me in ``chromium 67.0.3396.99``, as well as in ``chrome 69.0.3497.92``.

I tried a number of different emscripten settings, but none seem to change the behaviour without this change (stack size seems to be irrelevant; stack overflow checking and assertions don't seem to detect this problem; etc.).

Observation:
I manually "traced" the call leading to the construction of ``static Rules rules;``:

```
StandardCompiler::compileInternal()
CompilerStack::compile()
CompilerStack::compileContract()
Compiler::compileContract()
CompilerContext::optimise()
Assembly::optimise(bool, EVMVersion, bool, size_t)
Assembly::optimise(OptimiserSettings const&)
Assembly::optimiseInternal()
Assembly::optimiseInternal()
CommonSubexpressionEliminator::feedItems()
CommonSubexpressionEliminator::feedItem()
KnownState::feedItem()
KnownState::feedItem() type != Operation
KnownState::feedItem() !_item.pushedValue()
ExpressionClasses::find() Before tryToSimplify
ExpressionClasses::tryToSimplify: Before 'static Rules rules;'
Rules::Rules()
```

Execution never continues from there. However, after that I can see that remix calls ``StandardCompiler::compileInternal()`` again - and in this run the static Rules object is not initialized again, so the rule list remains empty.

EDIT: I'm talking about the case without the change in this PR.

Another observation:
Defining the ``Rules rules;`` object as a global variable, instead of statically inside a function, I get ``Unknown exception during compilation`` in remix and the following error in the javascript console:

Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

So my conclusion for the moment would be that (1) we should properly refactor ``simplificationRuleList`` with stack size in mind, since that's the cause of this particular problem, and (2) we should investigate why apparently a crashing or stuck or in any case not-properly-returning call of the standard compiler in ``soljson.js`` is not detected and reported e.g. in remix and instead the standard compiler is just called a second time while being in a non-sane state.

So that is not a stack overflow in the C++ code, but the JS optimiser.

I have mentioned last week that apparently Remix/Play did this, catching exceptions and running it again, because that "apparently made it to work".

Ah, ok - then if remix is changed back to actually expose such exceptions, we could for now just go with a fix like in this PR - if we can detect stuff like this in the future it's probably not too bad...

This is interesting, thanks a lot! So it seems that `soljson` is treated as a fixed binary in memory that is only initialized once - this is also something we should keep in mind all the time.

yay - that is the issue i ran into while working on `play` and i was talking with @axic during ETHberlin.
I spend 2 weeks trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong, because this issue did not show up on remix.

But now I know ...it DOES show up on remix and remix-alpha ...since forever :-)
It's just, that the compiler runs once when the page loads and it swallows that initial error.

Here is how you reproduce it:
**[how to reproduce - video](https://files.gitter.im/ethereum/remix-dev/DqNJ/Sep-17-2018-4_33-PM.webm)**



---
For now I will just swallow the error and move on, because that seems to be what works for remix for a long time already, so it's good enough and i can finally stop pulling my hair :-)

But yeah - i guess it would be nice if that was somehow fixed

This is reported to work.
