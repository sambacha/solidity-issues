### Description

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1190

Covers all points here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1190#issue-182101653 except `2` which from responses to this comment, I gathered was not needed. As part of these points, I clarified and polished docs around particular sections. I feel there's more needed, but I wanted to keep the PR as small as possible.

I also removed a `TODO:` that was in the document, and as it referred to what seemed like a big task, noted it for a future PR.
