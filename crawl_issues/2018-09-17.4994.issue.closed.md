# [\#4994 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4994) `closed`: Replace explicit cast from external function types by member
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

To reduce confusion, external function types should have a `.address` member instead of the explicit conversion to address.

I vote for this!

Hm, interesting idea.

I guess we cannot do the same with contract types, because that would conflict function members. So that is a disparity between the two.

However, we already have `.selector` on functions (including function types), so this feature should be in line with that.

I'd suggest we consider implementing it earlier (0.5.2?) and deprecating the explicit conversion.

I would say we implement all things we are quite confident about and make 0.6.0 early.

I'll implement this for functions now. Do we want this for contracts? I.e. ``c.address`` instead of ``address(c)``? Personally I'd stay with casts there, but I'd be fine with changing it as well.

We can only do it for functions like that because they do not have user-defined members.

We could still do it, since ``address`` has never been a valid identifier - I'd still not do it, but I opened #7235 for tracking it anyways.
