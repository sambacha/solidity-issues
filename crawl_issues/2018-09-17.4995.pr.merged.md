### Description

Closes #2180 that mentions several items missing from current docs that used to be present in the older Solidity Wiki. 

After reading through this older content I didn't find too much that wasn't covered in current docs, the language has depreciated, or was handled better in current docs (IMO). So this is a fairly small PR mentioning a couple of small things that clarify a couple of points.
