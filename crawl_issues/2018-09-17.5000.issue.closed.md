When we state some behaviour of Solidity in the documentation and give an example, the example should be verified as part of the CI runs.

Example:

Notet that the uint256 type wraps around at 2**256: ``uint256(2**256-1) + 1 == 0``

This should be automatically translated to
```
contract c {
function f() {
  assert(uint256(2**256-1) + 1 == 0);
}
}
```
and executed to check that it does not throw.

The same should be done with e.g. statements about inheritance, where the template needs to be different, of course.

I also have a lot of text linting tools I would love to add too. They are probably simpler after some configuration, and you can define what error threshold 'breaks' a build etc.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
