In the test about hexadecimal (upper case) literals, it is possible to see that we can mix upper case and lower case hexadecimal numbers. Is this behavior the intended one?

Yes, mixing case is intentional and also required for the address checksum.

It seems the coverage run is not properly working here.

Could you add tests for:
 - strings with escaped newlines (not '\n' but actual newlines)
 - string escapes like `\t`, `\v`, etc.
 - strings that do not terminate before end of file
 - strings thatend in `\`, followed by end of file
 - '0.x' (read that in the source as special case, not sure if it is)
 - file ending in `1.`

I added some test cases for strings (at least the first 3/4 points). 


I cannot understand exactly the last three cases:

> strings thatend in \, followed by end of file

Do you mean something like:
` bytes32 escapeCharacters = "text \";`

> '0.x' (read that in the source as special case, not sure if it is)

Do you mean something like:
`bytes32 x = '0.x';`

> file ending in 1.

I cannot understand this points

I meant e.g. a file that contains
```
contract c { function f() pure public { "abc\
```
(without an actual newline at the end of the file!)

And the second one:
```
contract c { function f() pure public { 0.x; } }
```
Third:
```
contract c { function f() pure public { 1.
```
(without a newline at the end of the file)

Great! If you also add the `0.` and `1.x` cases, this can be merged.

Real-time answer, great :) 

Just for clarification. Should I add the case for `0.`, `1.`, `0.x` and `1.x`?

How can I name the files for the remaining cases? I cannot imagine a meaningful names.

Should I rebase and squash the commits to one single commit?

I am sorry, I squashed the commits, and now I cannot see the required changes :/ May I ask you to re-add the  required changes?

@chriseth I think the original issue was misleading. The goal was to have coverage in `test/libsolidity/Scanner.cpp`.

Ah I see, sorry about that.
