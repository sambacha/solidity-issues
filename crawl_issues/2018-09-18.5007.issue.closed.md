@chriseth the exemption is thrown from `string const CompilerStack::lastContractName() const`
which is being called from `void CommandLineInterface::handleAst(string const& _argStr)` here is a code snippet 
``` cpp
	// do we need AST output?
	if (m_args.count(_argStr))
	{
		vector<ASTNode const*> asts;
		for (auto const& sourceCode: m_sourceCodes)
			asts.push_back(&m_compiler->ast(sourceCode.first));
		map<ASTNode const*, eth::GasMeter::GasConsumption> gasCosts;
		// FIXME: shouldn't this be done for every contract?
		if (m_compiler->runtimeAssemblyItems(m_compiler->lastContractName()))
		{
			//NOTE: keep the local variable `ret` to prevent a Heisenbug that could happen on certain mac os platform.
			//See: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3718 for details.
			auto ret = GasEstimator::breakToStatementLevel(
				GasEstimator(m_evmVersion).structuralEstimation(*m_compiler->runtimeAssemblyItems(m_compiler->lastContractName()), asts),
				asts
			);
			gasCosts = ret;
		}
```
 
I see two options. First wrap the code inside try and catch. The second possibility would be to check if the `m_contracts` inside `CompilerStack` is empty  before hand. However, for this check we would need to add a method to `CompilerStack` to check if its empty or provide a getter for `m_contracts` since its a private member.

I would say the solution is to turn the `if` into a loop over all contracts (you can use `m_compiler->contractNames()`) as suggested by the "FIXME".

ah and you also need to add up the gas costs, I would say.
