Implements #4944.

How to enable the optimization?
1. the optimization is controlled by the inline assembly language type and a boolean argument _allowStackOpt in the constructor of CodeTransform.
2. AssemblyStack will send its language type to CodeTransform and CompileStack set it as StrictAssembly.
3. _allowStackOpt is currently set to true for both AssemblyStack and CompileStack.

The optimization algorithm is as follows. The bracket before each step specifies the variables that are updated in the step.
1. [m_references] count reference number of names by ReferencesCounter when constructing CodeTransform for code generation.
2. [m_references] increase reference number for returned variables.
3. [m_references] decrease reference number for the LHS of assignments and variable references in Identifiers.
4. [m_unusedStackSlots, m_references] free variables after visiting a statement. **Only the variables that defined in the current scope (the scope contains the statement just visited) are freed, otherwise, we may free some variables that are used again in a loop.**
5. [m_unusedStackSlots, m_reusedVariables] reuse stack slot from unusedStackSlots when generating code for a variable declaration. **The unused stack slots may come from outer scopes that live longer than the current variables.**
6. [m_unusedStackSlots, m_reusedVariables] when finalizing a block, the reused variables are removed from m_reusedVariables and the stack slot is removed from m_unusedStackSlots when it is popped from the stack. **Because the order of identifiers is irrelevant from the order of their stack order, we cannot ensure the stack slots are removed from m_unusedStackSlots according to the order of variables visited from identifiers. But, after all the variables defined in current block are freed, all the free stack slots should be also removed from m_unusedStackSlots.**

This still needs the flag to enable and disable the feature and some asserts that if the feature is active, no non-strict assembly items are used.

The assembly language setting should always be "strict assembly", except for the single call to `assemble` in the commandline compiler. This means you do not need language settings in the ContractCompiler or CompilerContext.

Yes, you need to properly decrease the reference counter also on the left hand side.

Please note that the "switch" for code transform should not be just the language setting. There should be a separate bool that enables the "reuse stack slots" mode.

Do we need this been controlled by user input?

now, I store the language info in CompilerContext and pass it to CodeTransform. I think it is better to have a central place to control it and it should be a part of the context.

@liangdzou would you have time to work on this in the next days or would you be fine with me taking over?

I am working on developing a private blockchain recently. But, I think it is ok for me to work on this.

I have solved the conflict. Btw, I have updated the description for this PR to show the general idea of this solution. :-)

This should now work even with non-disambiguated source. Still needs many more tests. Also there might be something missing around function definition, I did not test that yet.
