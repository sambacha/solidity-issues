Fixes #4066 

A new function was added in TypeChecker to improve the following message "member not found after argument-dependant lookup in type ..." when type is a function. 

when a.b.test() is called the compiler will suggest a.b().test()

@bit-shift Yes when I rebased I applied a lot of commits, sorry about that. 
Fixed now, Thanks @chriseth !

I don't think this solves the mentioned issue. It should behave as follows:

```
contract c {
function f(uint) internal pure {}
function f(bytes) internal pure {}
function g() {
this.f;
}
}
```

The compiler cannot determine which if the two functions you mean because you did not actually call the function. The error should report: "did you intend to call the function?" (without providing the name because that is obvious, you already gave it in the source).

I understand the point you are making. 
In the case that was mentioned in issue #4060 the behaviour should be the same?
I should remove the function name suggestion and just leave the message "Did you intend to call the function."?

Yes, in the issue, where it had `a.b.test()` it should also provide the same error message - no need to mention the name (although you can, but it should be unique).

Great, changed.
What tests should I run to verify its not producing undesired output. 
I can check that the message is shown when it should (with examples) not so sure how to check the message is not shown in other places.

The test 576_member_getter_call_without_parentheses.sol is correct, the other one is not - calling the function will not help.

So the problem basically is as follows: If we search for a member in a function type and it is not present, then the user probably wanted to call the function and select the member in the return value of the function.

Do you know how to do this now? If you have a member access of a function type, ask the user if they intended to call the function.

@chriseth. I think I do.
Current tests (and code) cover getter functions. It this ok? 
If I extend to other methods like below, should I do it here or on a new PR?

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract B{
   function f() public returns (bool){
       return true;
   }
}
contract C{
    B b;
    function g() public returns (bool){
        return b.f;
    }
}
```

Please read my comment above again. The code you are writing should not perform name lookup and it should not have to care whether it is a getter or not.

Hi @chriseth  I added the change suggested. I needed to add extra code to prevent the message being added when gas (syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/495_builtin_ripemd160_reject_gas.sol) or selector (syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/485_function_types_selector_2.sol) was being called. Also  to prevent the message to be added when a declaration shadows the class (syntaxTests/constructor/overriding_constructor.sol).

I have some doubts regarding the behavior, for instance in the following example the code will not compile:

```
    contract A{
    }
    contract B{
        A public a;
    }
    contract C{
        B b;
        function f() public view{
            b.a.f();
        }
    }
```
And we are showing did you intend to call the function. Here if we call the function (as below) the code will not compile, however we will not show "did you intend to call the function"
```
    contract A{
    }
    contract B{
        A public a;
    }
    contract C{
        B b;
        function f() public view{
            b.a().f();
        }
    }
```
I believe this is not part of this PR but maybe is something that could be addressed in a different PR?

Can you provide an example why you need to check if the function returns a contract or struct?

> Can you provide an example why you need to check if the function returns a contract or struct?

If I just add `if (exprType->category() == Type::Category::Function)` then for the following cases the message "Did you intend to call the function?" will be added (wrongly) to the following cases.

```
    contract A {
        function f() public {
            keccak256.gas();
        }
    }
```
For this case alternatively I could check that name is not gas.

```
    contract B{
        function g() pure internal {
        }
        function f() public view returns (bytes4) {
            return g.selector;
        }
    }
```
again here I could alternatively check that the function name is not selector.

```
    contract C { function f() public {} }
    contract D is C {
      function C() public pure returns (uint8) {}
      function g() public {
        C.f();
      }
    }
```
For this case checking the struct or class will ensure that the "Did you intend to call the function?" will not be appended since its calling `function C() public pure returns (uint8)` rather than the getter.

Ah that's very clever! If possible, a more dynamic approach would be to check that the function if called, would return exactly one value and call `t->members(m_scope).membersByName(memberName)` on that type to check if the member is there.

This has the benefit that if we add more types in the future, we would not have to change this code.

@chriseth thanks for the feedback.
 I can certainly make that change. However in the following contract
```
    contract A{
        function f() private pure{

        }
    }
    contract B{
        A public a;
    }
    contract C{
        B b;
        function f() public view{
            b.a.f();
        }
    }
```

The member would not be there, hence the "did you intend to call the function" will not be appended. This is maybe a particular problem since there are two problems, calling a getter with out `()` and calling a private member from outside the contract. Clearly the user intended to call `  b.a().f();` i.e the getter. However, calling the getter will not help because `function f() private pure` is private and not accessible. The same would happened if f is not define. 
I think the question here is more conceptual. In this case should we or should we not show "did you intend to call the function?".

@mestorlx you are right, perhaps your simple solution is the better one. Please still combine it with the case about ".value".
