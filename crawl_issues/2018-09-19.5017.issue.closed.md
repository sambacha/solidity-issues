I see documentation as an integral part of any software project. Because of that, most changes to the code also often include changes to the documentation. Currently, we are doing an overhaul of the documentation as a preparation for the 0.5.0 release and because of that, there is more documentation traffic as opposed to code changes. Because of versioning (and other reasons), I think documentation should be part of the source repository.

Perhaps it would help if you stated the exact nature of the problem you are seeing - you might have a different viewpoint as an external contributor which we are not noticing.

Prefixing the title is probably a good idea, thanks for the suggestion! I don't see any other solution either.
