# [\#5046 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5046) `closed`: Keyword to declare source code which is inheritable, but not compilable.

My most frequent pain point with inheritance is ambiguity about _"which of these things are actually being deployed"_.

A typical repository might have 30 `contracts`, but only 5 or 6 derived contracts which compile to bytecode that will be deployed. For example, there is no reason to ever deploy a contract which is simply `Ownable`, so why would that be declared as `contract Ownable { ... }`. 

I was impressed with how the 0xProject handled this with a strict naming convention using the terminology of '[Mixins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin)'. For example, in this [directory](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/tree/development/packages/contracts/src/2.0.0/protocol/Exchange), only `Exchange.sol` will be deployed, everything else will be inherited to that contract.

I would like to propose creating a new keyword for declaring an inheritable piece of code. The chief benefit would be a clear indication that _"this is not intended to be a final contract"._ 

Perhaps: `inheritable`, `mixin` or `class`, could be used. The specific word isn't too important.

@fulldecent I felt like this deserved it's own issue. Feel free to place your `abstract` proposal in a comment here. 
For other's it's here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3729#issuecomment-423379028

The term abstract has never made a lot of sense to me in this context, but I've seen it used for precisely this purpose so it might be the best choice. I like the behaviors you proposed as well.

Consider the keyword `abstract`.

Example from https://github.com/0xcert/ethereum-utils/blob/master/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

abstract contract Ownable {
  address public owner;

  // event OwnershipTransferred...

  constructor() public {
    owner = msg.sender;
  }

  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner);
    _;
  }

  function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) onlyOwner public {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Nobody in their right mind would deploy the `Ownable` contract, even though it is presently possible. The keyword `abstract` removes the ability to compile this contract. And in the Remix IDE, abstract contracts won't even show up as compile targets.

In addition to *allowing* `abstract` keyword to compileable contracts. It is probably helpful to *require* `abstract` for non-compilable contracts. 

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

contract A {
    function x();
}
```

^^^ Presently this code is legal. I propose that it should be an error "Contracts with unimplemented methods must be explicitly marked as `abstract`." Or better, "Contract A must implement function x() or be marked as abstract". And of course, interfaces are implicitly abstract.

There is a long outstanding issue to track this: #649 

Is it possible to move this discussion over there?
