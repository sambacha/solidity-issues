The solfuzzer have found a lot of cases (but not all I have fixed here) which would result in a "JSON Logic error".

This still does not report errors if an unsupported key is used, does it?

No. I have another patch which fixes some other use cases of not checking the type upfront. While doing so I have released that perhaps we should take another angle at this, in order to make it cleaner as well as to support reporting unsupported keys

However for 0.5.0 I think we should just apply those extra checks (will push the PR later today) and rework it after.

Should already document though unsupported key should be considered errors.
