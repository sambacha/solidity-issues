# [\#5064 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5064) `closed`: Consider defaulting to IPFS for metadata hash

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-22 18:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5064):

Now that cloudflare added an ipfs proxy, we might be much better off defaulting to ipfs.

Any opinions?

Do you have a suggestion for metadata configuration options in standard json?

I thought about just switching, but the config option might be named `metadataCAS: ipfs` (content-addressed-storage)

Added a test file: QmdB5JktqW6LPioJXACMxPqLeB36LtZ4ZN8oE31EkiuAHt

After some failures, we started another ipfs node on the same network, it automatically connected to the first node and got the file. It still was not on the gateway but when I checked 30 minutes later, it appeared on the gateway. So now I think the next test is to wait for some days and re-check if it is still on the gateway.

Added another file which we also retrieved via the cloudflare gateway (to see whether its cache might have longer timeouts): QmXqNvVwR4hhNmwotFkHAosXnsxV8M7AdzxePvg5fXvYX8

The file that was also previously retrieved via cloudflare was available immediately (both on cloudflare and on the "official" gateway). The other file seems to be gone.

File is still present.

I guess we now have positive data towards IPFS?

Looks like it...

Will do the change in 0.6.0.
