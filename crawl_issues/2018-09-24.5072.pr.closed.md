Thanks for your contribution! Please avoid adding unnecessary whitespace and read about the coding style. Also I would suggest to name functions in verbal form and use substantives only for classes.

@axic I was assigned to it [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4894#issuecomment-424043517). I hope I'm going about submitting PRs and handling my issue correctly, if not, please advise.

@Meshugah I'm sorry, but I fear we cannot accept pull requests in such a form. Please either clean up the pull request so that it does not touch any unrelated lines (and squash) and explain why you decided to split it up like this or close the pull request.
