# [\#5074 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5074) `closed`: Yul: Optimize Name Dispenser

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-25 14:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5074):

The name dispenser currently performs a linear search. It would be better if it could store the latest counter (perhaps depending on the prefix, but that might be more work than necessary) so that it starts trying with a counter that is most likely free.
