# [\#5076 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5076) `merged`: [Yul] Expression breaker.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-25 15:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5076):

This is an optimizer component that splits up expressions into one operation per statement.

This stage is currently already used selectively in the "full inliner". The idea is to re-implement the full inliner with maximally split expressions to make it easier to implement.

This component will be complemented with another component that performs the reverse transformation.

This code is currently inactive.

Benefits: It is easier to rearrange operations
Drawbacks: Code is harder to read
