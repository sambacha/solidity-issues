I'd suggest to add a section about arithmetic over / underflows to the pitfalls. We could start off with something like: 

"An over/under flow occurs when an operation is performed that requires a fixed size variable to store a number (or piece of data) that is outside the range of the variable's data type. For example, subtracting ``1`` from a ``uint8`` (unsigned integer of ``8`` bits, i.e. only positive) variable that stores ``0`` as it's value, will result in the number ``255``. This is an underflow. "

I think a real-world example could be beneficial and we could also recommend the usage of ``SafeMath.sol``.
