# [\#5096 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5096) `closed`: Do not crash on invalid index access

Fixes #5057.
Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5195/.

Another instance of this https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L2253 uses `hasErrors()`.

I think that is unreliable and we may just use `fatalError` in `expectType`.

Need to add tests.

@chriseth please review this, the last failure is due to the need of checking `calldatasize` in the type checker for a multi dimensional array and rejecting if it is too large.

I split out https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5188 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5195. Since these PRs are very related to each other, I based my decision on where to split them on the parts of the compiler they change and not on the test cases they cover. 

This PR now depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5195, because the new signature of ``expectType()`` will only be introduced by that one.

After checking again, it became clear that #5195 already fixed the remaining bug that this PR is trying to fix. I will close it now as this change does not seem to be needed anymore.
