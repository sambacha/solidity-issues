### Description

As discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4844#discussion_r220599885

While this is passing information, as it's fairly important to know (as mentioned in original issue 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1644) I thought it needed more prominence, so reformatted as a warning and moved above the other note.
