It seems not all the tests can be compiled with it:
```
:2:1: Warning: Experimental features are turned on. Do not use experimental features on live deployments.
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
^-------------------------------^
:76:2: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
	function Registrar() public {
 ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
:11:1: The shadowed declaration is here:

	event NewBid(string indexed _name, address _bidder, uint _value);
	             ^------------------^
```

Is that an actual bug we have or the old encoder supports it?

Note, the tests don't care about those events, so they may as well be broken.

Update: there is a single test, `event_indexed_string`, which does seem to validate it.

So it seems all the failures are for cases where the two encoders explicitly differ.

Good news is that every other case works ðŸŽ‰ 

Now need to figure out a way how to properly have this merged.

@chriseth @ekpyron do you think this can be finished easily (i.e. certain tests have to have the ability to say they are not ABIEncoderV2 compatible)?

If not, should we merge the `soltest` command line option so that locally it can be run, but not make it part of the CI?

Or should we just close this.

I think this should be a feature of the new extracted end to end test format.

Another option would be to just implement indexed reference parameters for events for abi encoder v2.

Rebased (and removed the "indexed" modifications).

It looks like after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6000 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6029 the only problem left is something to do with a cleanup function for mappings - and looking at the code, this might actually be already fixed.

I was wrong, needed https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6030.

After that, this should turn green (apart from the few tests that are specifically written to highlight differences in the two encoders).

Rebased on top of the fixes.
