Fails.

Hey @axic, I noticed your build is failing because of the breaking changes introduced in 0.5.0 (e.g. the data location for certain types now being mandatory). I was actually tracking that in [this OpenZeppelin PR](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1068), and we even have an issue for this whole thing: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/issues/1211. 

What do you think about having a branch in OpenZeppelin that compiles using nightly builds, instead of you having to maintain your own fork? That way we could give you a hand maintaining, making sure the branch gets updated often to reflect the latest changes, and it'd also make it easier for us to upgrade to the latest version once its released.

@nventuro that would be wonderful! Do you already have such a branch?

I just created the [`solc-nightly`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/solc-nightly) branch, from `master`, and set the CI to only use the nightly compiler. To bring that branch up to date with 0.5.0, we should open PRs against it: we already have a couple from a while back (https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1068 and https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1144).

Will you make the updates? You know about https://github.com/axic/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/solidity-050 do you?

The problem is we haven't merged upstream changes to it for 3 months. We could do that, but I think merging these 2 new PRs will be faster.

No reason to keep this open.
