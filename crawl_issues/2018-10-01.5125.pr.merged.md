# [\#5125 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5125) `merged`: Fixes #5051 (introduced in #4684), effectively allowing underscores in address literals.

The bug in #5051 was implicitly introduced in #4684, therefore no need for a Changelog entry.

I've added a small test for ensuring address literals with underscores do compile correctly. I am not sure though whether it's the best place (it was the best I found so far).
