`Unbreaker` sounds a bit weird to me. I understand that the goal is to keep it connected to the `ExpressionBreaker` as the inverse operation, just wanted to bring that up.
Would you consider other names, such as `ExpressionInliner`?

Updated and renamed. I also made the constructor private and added a static function to prevent mis-use - not sure if it helps much, since the visitor functions have to be public.
