# [\#5134 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5134) `merged`: solfuzzer: adds --input-file=FILENAME command line argument (defaulting to stdin)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-10-02 12:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5134):

While debugging my other PR I had difficulties running solfuzzer on Windows and within VS2017 in debug mode due to the fact, that files are passed via stdin.

Thus I propose this change to allow passing files via command line parameter instead, yet defaulting to old behavior of using stdin if not stated otherwise.

Related to #4924.

Good idea!
I would propose to use the first unnamed option for the filename, though, just as with `solc`. What do you think?

I am absolutely fine with that idea. I just didn't know how to realize that in the first place. I'll look into solc's solution and then adapt this one.
