### Description

This change fixes #5053. I did not adapt the Changelog as this bug was just recently introduced in the 0.5 branch.

FYI: I was first trying to not get a solution via making the typeError into a fatalTypeError, however, I didn't find a clean solution, as every follow-up-change did look more like a workaround, so I decided to go with promoting this error from non-fatal to fatal. I'd however like to have a post-0.5 discussion on when to go fatal and where we wanna change that (I believe we'd need a change in the AST to easily reflect whether some node is in invalid-state due to internal bug vs already-reported-user-bugs).

Please add the example that uncovered the bug as a test case.

(or of course, the minimal version you found)

I don't think this is the proper fix. Take a look at the following example:
```
contract C {
    function f(uint y) public {
        //(1(y)) = 2;
        (f(2)) = 2;
    }
}
```
I think the failing assertion is just wrong and should be converted to an error. I assume that we only thought of assignments of the type `(a, b) = (c,d)`. Actually I think we should check whether `f() = (c,d)` works as expected, although I'm not sure if the result of a function call can ever be an lvalue...

@bit-shift no changelog entry because nothing was fixed that was broken at the previous release (at least I think...)
