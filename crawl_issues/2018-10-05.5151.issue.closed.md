**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

The section structure of the documentation is suboptimal. Most of the important information about the language is part of "Solidity in depth", although it is only one of 14 top-level elements in the TOC on the sidebar.

Perhaps it would be possible to show the sidebar in a multi-level format like on https://dutchx.readthedocs.io

@ChrisChinchilla would you like to take a shot at this?

@lazaridiscom thanks for your comments! I will focus only on the points directly related to this issue. Please feel free to open new issues for the other aspects. A agree that having many levels is a good thing. The main point I wanted to make here is that "Solidity in Depth" should be more prominent in the sidebar and perhaps even be extended no matter where you currently are in the documentation.

@lazaridiscom could you please expand the previous statement a little? What do you mean with "items in the root" and why do you think it would worsen the documentation?

We can try it out. This issue could also be solved by just grouping things that are currently parallel to "Soldity in Depth" into new sections so that at least the section "Solidity in Depth" is more prominent due to the smaller number of root level items, even if it is not expanded by default.

@chriseth and @lazaridiscom I had a pass at this.

Sphinx and the RTD theme don't give a lot of flexibility in menu layout (and I spoke to a few people with the same issue / questions), and there is no ability to have items expanded by default. SO I tried two things that I have in a branch, and here's a gif where you can see my rough ideas in progress.

I added:

- RTD does have these expandable plus icons that let you see the structure of docs without having open them. Added them so you can see how they work.
- With Sphinx and RTD you can create multiple groups of `toctree`s and manually determine the order. While the links under each of the sections I've created in the gif are not final, hopefully you get the idea.

OK, and if you like both or either of these ideas, then I can work on the final changes.

Seems like this got addressed in the meantime. If not feel free to re-open this.
