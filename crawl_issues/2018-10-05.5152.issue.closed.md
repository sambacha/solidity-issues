@lazaridiscom Thank you for the suggestion! In general, this sounds like a good idea, but I don't see the benefit of mentioning the employer here. If you want to view the list of team members, you can check https://github.com/orgs/ethereum/teams/solidity/members. We could also consider adding this to our README.

I am not sure if this is really beneficial. We do not have such a complex structure as metamask and we did not yet have problems that people contacted the wrong person. We do not have such a big influx of requests and they are handled well in issues and on gitter.

I partially agree with the GitHub user information, but listing the roles seems unnecessary to me since we don't have more than 2.

We have two technical roles: developer and writer. All developers do the same type of work, with no distinction between QA and others, for example. We do have a team lead and co-lead, but those management roles do not influence the technical work since they are developers, like the others.
