### Description

This PR provides the ability to auto-infer the test directory, making the `--testpath` command line parameter to `soltest` executable optional (if inferred correctly).

The logic used is basically the same as in `isoltest`. However, the code block was duplicated because it's to simple to create a shared lib out of it.

I've also adjusted to `ETH_TEST_PATH` logic *a bit* because I believe that command line parameter flags should always be prioritized to environment variables (aligns well with standard UNIX tools).

(Implements #5129)
