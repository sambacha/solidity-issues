The cost of the function call is determined by passing it to `CodeCost::codeCost`, isn't that right?

Also, should this work only when the function's arguments are literals (e.g. `exp(2, 3)`)? Or should it work for all expressions including identifiers (e.g. `exp(a, b)`) and function calls (e.g. `exp(a, add(2, b))`)?

The second argument should be a literal, the first can be anything (but should be a variable in yul).

`exp(x, k)` costs 60 gas for k < 256.

For k < 9 it is more expensive than using `dup` and `mul` and the compiler should be optimizing it.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
