# [\#5159 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5159) `closed`: Add some guards around the editor execution in isoltest.
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

We should not blindly execute `$EDITOR`. We could check that it is a path to an executable and also inform the user about what is about to be executed. Also, the filename should probably be properly quoted.

Actually I'm not really convinced by this one and even less sure about it being of "medium severity" in the audit - the respective code will never be executed in production scenarios and will only ever be executed interactively - it makes no sense to use it automatically or without user interaction... If one considers it bad to execute $EDITOR in an interactive testing tool, since its value may have been compromised, by the same logic, we cannot "blindly execute" $DEBUG_PREFIX in scripts/soltest.sh and there's probably a lot more of these cases...

That being said we could of course just not fall back to the environment variable at all in ``isoltest`` and only rely on the ``--editor`` argument, skipping the edit suggestion, if no ``--editor`` argument was given. Also, we could go for platform specific code for actually executing it (although avoiding that was the main reason to use the dubious ``system`` call in the first place).

Actually we could just use ``--editor ${EDITOR}`` in ``isoltest.sh``, since it seems like doing something like that in shell scripts is fine ;-).

Is this still relevant?

I agree about the security assessment. We blindly execute "$CC", but we should probably add quotes.

Actually we do not need quotes there.
