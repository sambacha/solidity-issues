# [\#5161 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5161) `closed`: Try to keep source location for generic routines

Generic routines often do not have a proper source location because the location cannot be uniquely assigned if the routine is used from multiple places. Often, such routines are only used from a single place and in that case, the source location should be retained.

I think https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9029 can be considered to fix this.
