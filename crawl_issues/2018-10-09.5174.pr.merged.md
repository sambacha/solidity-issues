# [\#5174 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5174) `merged`: Clarify contract creation transaction

The change clarifies how contracts are deployed. The docs state that it's a transaction sent to `0` address (which is incorrect), the PR changes that to emphasize that the recipient is not set.
