Run coverage only on the coverage branch.

Reason:
 - It does not work on pull requests anyway.
 - The coverage binary created in the build process cannot be used for releases.

Calculating the diff in coverage, at least in the message that is posted. If only the message is wrong, we should at least prevent the message from being posted, as it is extremely distracting.
