### Description

Hi there, new to the project and quite excited about Solidity. As a stubborn (and lacking other environment options) Windows user, I found that there was an important difference in the statement used for running Solidity tests, so I've added a note for Windows users on where they have to look to run the tests. Hopefully it'll save some time for some developers. 

I've done my best to follow the practices laid out in the contributing docs, and I'm interested in further contributing documentation and other fixes. Let me know if I've missed something or forgot a protocol. I didn't update the changelog as I didn't really notice documentation being common, but I'm more than happy to add it in if need be.

Thanks for the contribution @Mordax I am also very keen to make the onboarding process easier for everyone. I'm going to test this all myself on a Windows VM and will let you know if I have any suggestions.

@ChrisChinchilla Awesome, let me know if you run into anything and I can confirm on my end.

@Mordax @chriseth I found some confusion with the various MS dependencies needed but couldn't quite pinpoint what I had forgotten to install. I may test again in the future. If you err on the side of install more than you need everything builds correctly.

@Mordax One question for you. I then looked at how to run tests under Windows. Have you had any success with those, and would you be willing to submit a PR maybe clarifying how Windows users can do that?

@ChrisChinchilla Oh, I'm sorry, I didnt realize you pinged me so long ago! Maybe it's too long ago but I recall having some issues with running tests on Windows and then magically getting it to work. What problem did you run into? It may jog my memory and if it does, I'll do another PR.

@Mordax Mostly just knowing how to get them started I think.
