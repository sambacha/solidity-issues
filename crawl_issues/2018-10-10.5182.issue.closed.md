# [\#5182 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5182) `closed`: CREATE2 documentation is incorrect

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2018-10-10 00:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5182):

The CREATE2 documentation in assembly states that:

> create2(v, n, p, s)

> create new contract with code mem[p…(p+s)) at address keccak256(0xff . self . n . keccak256(mem[p…(p+s))) and send v wei and return the new address, where 0xff is a 8 byte value, self is the current contract’s address as a 20 byte value and n is a big-endian 256-bit value

This is wrong. [EIP 1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) states: 

> Adds a new opcode at 0xf5, which takes 4 stack arguments: endowment, memory_start, memory_length, salt.

Proposal:

Change this to:

> create new contract with code mem[n…(n+p)) at address keccak256(0xff . self . s . keccak256(mem[n…(n+p))) and send v wei and return the new address, where 0xff is a 8 byte value, self is the current contract’s address as a 20 byte value and s is a big-endian 256-bit value
