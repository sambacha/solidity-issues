# [\#5198 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5198) `closed`: refine memory-store assertions, re #4891

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2018-10-11 05:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5198):

The initial suggestion (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4891#issuecomment-427708206) was to implement `Type::isMemoryStorable`. But as it looks, the existent `Type::canBeStored` does the job already.

So, it looks like everything is already there - except tests. Despite `codegen` being deprecated, some tests should be provided.

Possibly someone can showcase me how the tests would be written (one tiny test, or an existent similar test would be enough).

I don't think it makes sense to test this. By definition, the assertion cannot be tested, at least not through the full system.

Aha! Please ignore for now. I need to fully setup my local test-system first (the no-ipc tests do not catch the errors).

I will collapse, if you continue "micro-management". Remember:

Just 4 days passed (i know, an eternity if you await results).

Bad news and good news re docs: too many obstacles (but nothing that cannot be fixed).

* `_type.sizeOnStack() == 1,` seems essentially like an `isMemoryStorable` or `isStackable`.
* the `numBytes==0` assert stays (should never happen assert)
* the valueType assert is a non-implemented kind 

As for `Type::prepareMemoryStore()`, I'm not sure what to do there at all. `numBytes ==0` has its own processing.

Not sure if its worth the effort to provide an `Type::isStackable()`, possibly this would just introduce duplication (although isStackable could access ~the info~ the already existent info, like an convenience method).

`isStackable` should always return true. Every single type is usable on the stack.

Ok, fixed your comments.

Now, this error-messaging confuses me a bit and I get this "something is wrong" feeling again.

Shouldn't

  "Memory store of 0 bytes **requested** (Type: " + _type.toString(true) + ")."

become

"Memory store of 0 bytes **not allowed** (Type: " + _type.toString(true) + ")."

?

`not allowed` expresses very clearly the issue (error) at hand.

Then:

"solAssert" results in a message "Internal Compiler Error", which sounds a bit like "a deep core failure".

Shouldn't this be expressed more like an "Language Usage Error", so it becomes clear that is not a compiler-error, but a usage-error.

So, this would become:

* **solAssert**: very "should never happen" things
* **solUsageAssert**: the solidity user programmed strange stuff which is not allowed
* **solUnimplementedAssert**: the solidity user programmed stuff which is not yet implemented

(let me know if this makes sense, thus I open/formulate an Issue)

The purpose of asserts is to re-ensure any assumptions about data being handed between modules of the Solidity compiler. When a solAssert is triggered, it is always a compiler error and never a user error. in this case, `prepareMemoryStore` should never ever be called for a type that has zero bytes size. The actual condition to check that should be higher up in the compiler. If this check fails due to some reason (because someone changed the compiler code), we will not get a problem down here because of the assert. The compiler will exit with an error and hopefully prompt the user to report the problem with us, so we can fix the compiler.

I need to keep the commits to be able to "replay" things (e.g. my "not-understanding" or "the rework-flow"). As mentioned, will squash later.

I'm 3 decades within IT. You usually have to explain me only things that:

* Are undocumented in your system
* Are "strange" in your system

Your current error messaging is a bit confusing to me (a newcomer, who stays "newcomer", to be able to spot such weaknesses).

#5298 attempts to solve this, or to lay the way to solve this (e.g. whilst modifying the issue). You should not close issues that fast.

There is still something wrong here, don't know what. Can it wait one day?

I am sorry that I might have closed your issue too early, but the name `solUsageAssert` just is inconsistent in itself in my opinion, so I really do not see how such a draft could reach completeness in any way. This is also the reason why I explained what my impression of asserts are. No matter how long people are in the same field, there might always be misunderstandings and they should be removed as early as possible.

Apart from rebasing and some fine-tuning in the assertion messages (which is really not that important), I think this PR is fine to merge.

(ignoring all "side-issues" for now)

One existent detail:

You requested earlier to change "solUnimplementedAssert" to "solAssert" (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5198#pullrequestreview-165834962) , yet the message mentions "not implemented". 

> "Memory store of types with stack size != 1 not implemented."

So, if I understood the mechanisms right, either "not implemented" must be changed to e.g. "not allowed", or solAssert must become solUnimplementedAssert again (as it was).

(The other issues are more conceptually / fundamental, I will ignore them for now.)
