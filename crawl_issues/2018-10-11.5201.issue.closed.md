# [\#5201 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5201) `closed`: Investigate staticcall/delegatecall trampoline
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

View library functions are currently called using delegatecall, because there is no delegatecall+staticcall combination. It could be possible to call the current contract using staticcall with a special signature which then forwards to the actual library using deleatecall.

Things to investigate:

 - how much more gas will it cost?
 - which identifier can be used such that there will be no clash with existing function identifiers?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
