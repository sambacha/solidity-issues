FIxes #5103 

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [?] All tests are passing //I pray they do
- [?] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

### Description
I may have missed a few things, it's my first time working on a programming language. 
Since Issue #5103 's references EndToEndSuite, I made the test in the SolidityEndToEnd.cpp. 

Hopefully the integrated tests won't be too mad. If I'm missing any fundamental things, misunderstood something or if I should add another case in the same test, let me know. Cheers!

Great! Could you squash the two commits into a single one? Then this is ready to be merged.
