Please use a more recent commit to pin to - optimally "today". We did lots of changes especially in those days.

@chriseth yeah, this was the one picked when this process started, but I will contact all translators and encourage them to update if they haven't got too far.

@msusur A quick thought. Can you add the repository to a read the docs build so we can add a rendered link to the main solidity docs?

We are currently working on a new, hopefully more structured workflow for the Solidity docs translations. I will ping you once this is ready. Closing this issue for now, you can track the progress of the new process etc. in issue #10119.
