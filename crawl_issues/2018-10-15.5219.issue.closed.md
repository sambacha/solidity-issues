Put the Yul subsystem into its own designated static library.

@christianparpart what is still to be done here?

I'm closing this as libyul doesn't have a public API yet, so it cannot be considered fully independent. The closest to public API is in `libsolidity/interface/AssemblyStack`.

I don't think it needs a public (read: stable) API to be an independent library.

Making it into a static library only really makes a difference if it has a public API. It is already a separate library in the build system, with its dependencies duly listed.
