### Description

The `test/Options.h` header file does not include `boost/core/noncopyable.hpp` that is necessary for the compiler to understand the definition of the `boost::noncopyable` object. This PR includes the said file.

Argh, this seems to be not compatible with older versions of boost. I actually thought about this but meged anyway...

Oops, sorry about that. I should have clarified in the PR text that I was building against the upstream master of boost. Does this break stuff?

No worries, I force-merged before all tests were complete, so we would have noticed if I had been a little more patient :)

Okay :-)

For future reference, what boost version should I be linking Solidity against?

Thank you!

@bshastry your version is fine, it is just that we are also using older versions that still had that file in a different directory.
