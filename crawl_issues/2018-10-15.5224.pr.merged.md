### Description

This PR fixes a compiler warning that stalls the solidity build via clang version 8. Although g++ may not issue this warning, this fix may be generally useful.

The problem is that clang-8 complains that the following explicitly defined copy and move constructors for the Expression object in `libsolidity/formal/SolverInterface.h` are implicitly deleted. Although I do not fully understand this piece of code, I think the following is happening:

- Expression object explicitly asks the compiler to create move and copy constructors for the Expression object
- Expression object can be constructed using a `std::string` data type that does **not** have a copy/move constructor
  - I believe `std::copy` and `std::move` are used for this purpose

So, the compiler is caught between obeying the explicit definition and not being able to create one?

Could you provide the full error message, please?

Here's the full warning report from the clang-8 compiler that this PR fixes. Please note that since -Werror is on, any compiler warning is going to stall the build (which is what happened in this case).

Thanks a lot, that is very insightful! I guess it would be good for us to configure a CI job with clang8.

The difficulty in setting up a clang8 run is that clang8 is not released yet...

That's true. I feel such a CI job would need to first build clang upstream from sources before compiling solidity against clang-8. FWIW oss-fuzz folks use [this script](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/infra/base-images/base-clang/checkout_build_install_llvm.sh) to do the former.

Regarding this specific PR though, I believe merging it is harmless unless there is a divergence between the compilers used in the present CI job. But having seen that all checks passed, I would assume there was no such issue. My 2 cents.

Thank you.

Yes, this PR fixes the warning but it shows a deficiency in the code that should be fixed in a different way. We do want this class to have move semantics. I think removing the `const` qualifiers in the members would be a better fix. Could you please do that?

Sure. I'll do it and ping back. Do you think const is stopping the compiler
from generating a copy/move constructor for the Expression object?

At least that's what the error message you posted says.

I did this and verified that the warning does not appear with clang-8 anymore. HTH.
