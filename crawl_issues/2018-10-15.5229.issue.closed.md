# [\#5229 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5229) `closed`: [Yul] Avoid clashes with builtin functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-10-15 19:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5229):

The disambiguator and the name dispenser should never generate names that match the name of builtin functions. This includes names of instructions and builtin functions of the dialect.

This actually also applies to the parser - depending on the context (yul, strict inline assembly, strict inline assembly meant to access yul objects, ...) different builtin functions are available and thus reserved.
