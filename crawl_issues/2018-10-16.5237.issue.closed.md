Currently, we do not test the following in between the optimizer steps:
 - whether all names are unique
 - whether the code is valid (i.e. all used variables are in scope, etc)

Not having such checks makes sense in production, but we should at least have the option to enable them for testing purposes.

There are quiet a few tests in `test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests`. Is this issue still unsolved?

We are currently testing steps in isolation and we are testing the full suite. What we are not testing is the items in the descriptoin of the issue.

We test code validity at every test for a few months. Are you saying there should be a switch which enables code validity testing in every step in the optimizer suite?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
