# [\#5239 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5239) `closed`: [Yul] Simple optimizer that does its job well for the ABI coder

The final optimizer should always create compilable code (we had some issues with too many local variables) and the cost of the code should not be too much higher than for the old coder. It will be slightly higher because we added additional checks. Also note that the old coder did not combine any code - if two functions had the same parameters, there would be two copies of the decoder.

Idea to avoid problems with too many local variables:

We could check that after inlining, a function in isolation is compilable.

This is mostly implemented but still needs some testing. Because of that, I'll move it to 0.5.5.

I'll close this for now.
