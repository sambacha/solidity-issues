For some CircelCI jobs, it is quite tedious to click on the failing test and search for the error message. It would be much better if a script could directly post the error message as a comment to the pull request. I think this is especially useful for newcomers who do not know what the failures mean and how to get the test logs.

I'm especially thinking about the spell checker - the script could even post a review comment at the relevant line. The same could be done with compilation errors, though this might be more difficult.

There could already be tools out there that do this.

This would probably need an API access token which will be provided later on, please test with your own tokens first while developing this feature.

I‘m interested in this. In what form should the bot be contributed? Should the code actually go into this repo?

Will add a report error script and add some of the functions to the testing scripts that will catch the error and will use the Github API to add a comment to the PR. It should not be too difficult in adding comments to the diff it will just require parsing the error message and determining which line it occurred on. I have done other bounties involving CI interaction with Github so this should take me a few days to have mostly complete. 

Will we need to report errors encountered for all scripts that are run or are their specific scripts that the reporter should be used?

Have started messing around with adding a script to catch any error messages and posting that as a comment to a PR in a personal project. Can be seen in [this PR](https://github.com/halonproject/hydra-go/pull/9). Currently working on getting the error formatting to be a bit easier to read and then will open a PR when it is at a point where it looks good.

@BeckmaR sorry, I only saw your comment now. The idea would be that it is a small script that is part of the other CI scripts we already have.

@cpurta I think your PR is going into the direction I was envisioning here. Do you know which permissions are required for the access token? I guess I would need to create a new account, but I don't want the account to be able to modify any code, for example.

@cpurta I had a quick look at the API endpoint you are using, and it seems that posting to a specific line would still need some conversion between file line number and "diff index" (whatever that exactly means).

@chriseth the only permissions that I have for the access token that I am using is the `repo` and `write:discussion` permissions. Everything is checked in those sections.

As far as adding comments to the diff I am working on adding some functionality to parse the error(s) for filenames and try and find those in the diff and make a comment on the diff that way.

Working on parsing the git diff for a pull request and then attempting to find any errors within the diff. That should give me the index within the git diff in order to make a comment on the specific line that is causing the error. I think that if the error cannot be found within the git diff the bot should then just post a general comment on the PR itself. @chriseth does that seems inline with your thoughts for the bot?

Sounds great! If you want, we can already start with just posting comments in general.

Pull request is working as intended for the spell check test. It does need github access token in order for the script to properly post the comment to pull request. Requested that access token be generated and added to circle ci env variables but have not heard back on whether that has been generated.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
