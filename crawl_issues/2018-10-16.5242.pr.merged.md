We usually do not test assertions. Do you really want to add that?

Or do you want me to add some source code that would violate the assertion and check that it is properly reported earlier?

> We usually do not test assertions. Do you really want to add that?

That is correct, however I feel this is a slightly different scenario since we have so many parts (aka all the optimiser stages) which can generate Yul AST, it would make sense verifying these assertions actually work properly.

> Or do you want me to add some source code that would violate the assertion and check that it is properly reported earlier?

We should have a good coverage of that but verifying that all of these are caught by the parser would be a good task.
