Thanks again @Karocyt it looks like you used a recent commit to fork form, we are making quite a lot of changes to the English docs at the moment, so please let me know if you have any questions or things you need help with.

Thanks to you! I'm looking for an internship, so I'm translating and learning at the same time. Expect me to be slower and slower the deeper I get!

What do you expect to see changing that much ?
Even if the layout/wording can change and a few things be rephrased, everything seems reliable and in line with 0.5.0 so far.

@Karocyt We are just making lots of small changes, and new features, so hard to say exactly, but any effort in your part is very welcome and I hope to find you more contributors too.

@Karocyt I'd be happy to help you on this task!

Thanks for your help @clemlak, invite sent, enjoy!
I'm committing every time I start working on a new file, so far going down in the menu. Pick your favorite and come along!
I tend to keep the english keywords (like "stack" or "smart contracts") but try to remind their french counterparts from time to time.
When we'll be done with translating, we might need a "Glossaire" page to sum up the specific english terms that we kept, or we can agree on translating them all, but it looks weird to me, as it should SEO-wise.
You'll need an account on readthedocs too if you want to see it rendered straight away!

Hi @borowszky
You're more than welcome!

I started this on a v0.5.0 pre-relase and we're now on v0.6.8 so I don't know how accurate it is anymore.
I had a crazy year and couldn't find much time.
I'll check about versioning the doc tomorrow to keep the half-translated state as 0.5.0 and work on a fresher one with you.
The layout seems mostly unchanged so I should be able to easily check/port what I've done so far.

Thank you for your response. 
Will be expecting feedback on this, Am eager to start.

I migrated to the new layout and kept the English part when anything meaningful had been changed.
I committed on a file by file basis for the ones I did, so the last commit message usually tells you how much is left to do on that particular file.
We're now based on the release v0.6.8 commit [0bbfe45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/0bbfe45376768007a38bfd65f8ea449935306037).

I created [this thread](https://github.com/Karocyt/solidity-fr/issues/3) on the French side of things.

We are currently working on a new, hopefully more structured workflow for the Solidity docs translations. I will ping you once this is ready. Closing this issue for now, you can track the progress of the new process etc. in issue #10119.
