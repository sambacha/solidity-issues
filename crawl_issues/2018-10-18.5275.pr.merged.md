Logic is now split into the following methods:
- TypeChecker::typeCheckABIDecodeAndRetrieveReturnType (unchanged)
- TypeChecker::typeCheckTypeConversionAndRetrieveReturnType (added)
- TypeChecker::typeCheckFunctionLikeAndRetrieveReturnType (added)
- TypeChecker::typeCheckNonABIDecodeFunctionLike (added)

### Description
FunctionCall AST nodes can represent type conversion, struct construction and function call expressions, each of which require different type check and annotation logic and which was handled in a single large and unwieldy method.

Logic common to all FunctionCall nodes such as visiting descendent AST nodes, evaluating argument types for positional funciton expressions, assignment of annotations and initial determinination of FunctionCall sub-type (i.e. type conversion, function call, etc.) was left in TypeChecker::visit(FunctionCall const&).

Error checking and return type determination logic was moved to distinct methods and for function call/struct ctors return type determiniation was separated from the rather more lengthy error checking logic.

Function calls of kind ABIDecode were already delegated to a separate method TypeChecker::typeCheckABIDecodeAndRetrieveReturnType(...) which was left unchanged.

Thanks for your pull request! Your version of `TypeChecker::visit(FunctionCall` now looks very clean! Reviewing this properly will take some time, though, I hope you don't mind. Also note that you have a build error:
```
/root/project/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp: In member function 'dev::solidity::TypePointer dev::solidity::TypeChecker::typeCheckFunctionLikeAndRetrieveReturnType(const dev::solidity::FunctionCall&, dev::solidity::FunctionTypePointer)':

   if (bool const allowDynamicTypes = m_evmVersion.supportsReturndata())

Sorry – my build box is Centos7 w/stock GCC 4.8.5; it built cleanly on that.

I’ve reproduced w/devtoolset-7 (GCC 7.3.1) and pushed fix to github.

Note I’ve also checked ‘test/soltest -- --no-ipc’ passes (this is with GCC 4.8.5 build).

Please do take all the time you need to review – I understand.

 

Oddly I did see GCC 4.8.5 fail on a similar error in boost 1.66 for which I patched the boost header locally

i.e. boost/optional/optional.hpp:954:5: error: unused parameter ‘rhs’ [-Werror=unused-parameter]

It’s not clear to me why GCC 4.8.5 then didn’t complain about TypeChecker.cpp.

@ekpyron Thank you for your review, I've just checked in commit addressing them all.
@chriseth THank you for the additional comments, I'm reviewing them now and will check in one further commit once I'm done.

Hi - @ekpyron @chriseth, thank you both again for your reviews.

I have commited the last revision of this for tonight which I believe addresses all issues that have been raised. I have worked the visit() method a bit more and the logic flow is now quite clean IMHO.

I have left comments marked REVIEW regarding handling of non-callable nodes (i.e. errors) - in the original code, such function call nodes would have been marked as FunctionCallKind::FunctionCall but the functionType would have been null; an empty type tuple return type would have been assigned and "Type is not callable" would have been reported to the error reporter.

In the new logic, such nodes are marked as FunctionCallKind::Unset - however to avoid triggering the assert I force the kind back to FunctionCallKind::FunctionCall to maintain the previous behaviour. Clearly attempting to call a non-callable expression should be a normal compile time warning, not a failed assertion - but I don't know if leaving the node's function call kind set to Unset would cause issues elsewhere.

Nice! Is it possible to squash some of the commits (especially the "review feedback" ones)?

Great, I have squashed the PR branch into one commit, rebased it on to the head of develop and forced it back to github. This should now hopefully be ready to go/merge.
