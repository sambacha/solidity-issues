### Description

Hello,

This PR (CC #5212 ):
  - adds a libfuzzer fuzzer test harness
  - a corresponding entry in `test/tools/CMakeLists.txt`

~~I wouldn't know how to have the upstream CI not complain about `libFuzzingEngine.a` which is only relevant for the fuzzing build.~~
To keep CI bots happy, the fuzzer harness is compiled only when an environment variable called `OSSFUZZ` is set. This variable is expected to be set in the oss-fuzz build script.

Once this PR is correctly merged, the plan is to issue another PR to upstream google oss-fuzz repo to start fuzzing solidity continuously.

At the moment, I have a PR waiting in line to this effect that works quite well (achieves a coverage of over 3000 CFG edges). But before we proceed further, it is important to streamline this harness upstream so that it can be maintained along side code.

Hope this helps, looking forward to questions and a smooth oss-fuzz integration.

P.S. First issue found here #5279

Any way to extract shared code between `solfuzzer.c` and this?

imho, moving forward code from `solfuzzer.c` can be migrated to `solc_target.c` or potentially new libfuzzer style targets. This is because oss-fuzz uses all popular fuzzers (afl-fuzz, libfuzzer, hong-fuzz) under the hood.

Question before I address some of the comments in this thread:

What do you think about replacing `fuzzer.cpp` with an oss-fuzz specific fuzzing harness that is not picked up by solidity's continuous integration server but by Google's? This would mean that the fuzzing would take place on Google infrastructure and the bugs reported would be emailed to us.

@bshastry we should provide both harnesses but they should share the same code internally.
