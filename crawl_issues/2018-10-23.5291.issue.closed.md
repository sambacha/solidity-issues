# [\#5291 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5291) `closed`: [Yul] Combine syntactically equivalent functions
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

This optimizer pass needs to determine whether two functions are equal and then replace all calls to the first by calls to the second.

Comparing if two functions are equivalent can of course only be done on a syntactical level. It has to start with computing the mappings between variable names. We should also not perform a quadratic comparison of all functions, but instead use a mapping to a coarser equivalence relation first, like the size of the function.

Inspiration: https://www.llvm.org/docs/MergeFunctions.html (we already have a module that computes the code size).

Any more involved comparisons apart from renamed variable names (like swapped instructions etc) should NOT be performed. If we think something like that is necessary, then it would probably better to add another component that transforms all functions into a normal form first.

As a tradeoff, we could at least have the SSAValueTracker or the DataFlowAnalyzer run in parallel so that the following two might be considered equivalent:
```
let a := 1
let b := calldataload(2)
mstore(a, b)
```

```
let b := calldataload(2)
let a := 1
mstore(a, b)
```

Removing from 0.5.3 because the more involved comparison should be implemented in another release.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
