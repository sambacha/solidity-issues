## Notes

It is not that each and every directory should contain a README.

But important subsystems should have one. Or those with a special status (e.g. like `codegen`, which is deprecated).

I'm sorry, but I think this is too much overhead for us.

I would really love to talk to you in person at some point, because I think it would allow us to clarify many points that would take very long in the current communication process.
