Are we still doing this?

I think coverage should be much higher now that we have more commandline tests.

We don't have proper coverage numbers, but we do have 134 tests.

Should we close this?

I think that many options/option combinations are not being tested. At least that's the impression I got when I was adding/changing stuff in it. Still, those tests are usually just simple smoke tests because they just expect the output to match 1:1 so it's debatable how much of this really needs to be explicitly tested. A coverage report would be helpful here.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
