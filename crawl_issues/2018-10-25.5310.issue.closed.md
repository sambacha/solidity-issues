# [\#5310 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5310) `closed`: [Yul] Rematerializer should also take number of uses into account

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-10-25 16:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5310):

The purpose of the rematerializer has shifted since the introduction of the new expression simplifier. Previously, it was required to perform expression simplification, since the simplifier would not follow variables. The rematerializer is also the only step that generates bigger code (perhaps apart from the function inliner). Because of that, we should not consider it a too much functional component anymore but rather one that improves readability of code.

The new rules should be:

If the value is movable and only used once, then the value should be copied.
If the variable is used more than once but the value is small (only a vairable itself or a cheap instruction), then the value can also be copied.
