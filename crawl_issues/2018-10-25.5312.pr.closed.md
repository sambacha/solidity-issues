# [\#5312 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5312) `closed`: [DO NOT MERGE] Activate optimizer.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-10-25 16:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5312):

This activates the Yul optimizer whenever the regular optimizer is active.

We should probably just add it as a fine-grained optimizer control swich in the standard-json settings.

This will currently not be able to generate code for most examples because there will be too many local variables. But this should be solved by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5008
