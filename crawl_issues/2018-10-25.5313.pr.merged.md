### Description

Adding an error reporting script that will take any errors from scripts and post those as comments to an associated pull request. In order to use this script in any other scripts used by CircleCI it will need to be imported by the testing script and trap any exit with the `report_error_to_github` function. It also requires that any errors are written to the scripts `ERROR_LOG` file. This is perhaps one of the cleaner way to trap any errors encountered in testing scripts and report them to github. 

This will require that a github access token be created for the bot and that will need to be stored in CircleCI's private environment variables. Currently my username is being used in the script and will need to be updated to the bot's username.

Most recent commit attempted to post the error message but was denied due to authentication since there is probably not an access token set in Circle CI.

@chriseth at this point it may be worth creating a github access token for the script to utilize to ensure that it is able to post the comment to this PR.

@chriseth what other tests are you thinking should have errors reported to github?

@cpurta it seems the escaping of the error message is not working properly. The access token has permission to post comments, I tried it out locally.

Yeah looks like the error message contains some back ticks which will need to be escaped.

My impression was that it's the newlines. If it is too hard to do that with bash, perhaps we could use python.

Yeah you are right about the newlines. Thought that the back ticks were throwing things off. I don't think that it should be too hard to do in bash but will go the python route if needed.

Got the error formatting and posting correctly. Thinking about changing the error message to include the job that failed and the commit hash.

Would look something like:

There was an error when running `test_check_style` for commit `438b1cf`:

Having some issues trying to squash the commits by rebasing `git rebase -i upstream/develop`. Attempted to remove the merge commit and it then causes a conflict due to the changes in `check_style.sh`. Attempting to rebase after the merge removal just errors out (unsure as to why). Would it perhaps be better to create a new branch with the finalized changes and open a PR using that with just a single commit?

Believe that I got those commits squashed. At least according to my git log. Not sure if github is able to show those when squashed.

Github still shows 16 commits. Let me try to fix it...
