# [\#5315 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5315) `merged`: [WIP] w.r.t. Yul's ExpressionJoiner

[Yul] ExpressionJoiner: cleanup (and ideally soon-be-fixing #5244)

### Changes
* ensure public API is only containing `run(Block&)`, all the rest is private API / implementation details
* adding some comments to class data members to quicker understand their meaning
* eliminate unnecessary `operator()(If&)` as it's not changing default behaviour of `ASTModifier`
* simplify readability of `visit(Expression&)`'s impl, also moving assert's into "isLatestStatementVarDeclOf", as this one is already ensuring exactly that.
* ctor impl's use of ReferenceCounter use shortened.
* renamed and improved `isLatestStatementVarDeclOf` to better match its meaning (especially since it's only used once)
* eliminate `operator()(Switch&)`: We can also safely remove the this override because it's not changing behavior. I know the override is not running through the `Case.value`, but that's of type `Literal`, which is a no-op in the base class.

### Open Questions
Of course, the actual motivation of working on `ExpressionJoiner` is to eliminate the need of having to run it twice(+), which at least is the case for the `"fullInliner"` test.

While going through the code, I first had to understand it, and found some oddities which I addressed in the prior commit[s] so far.

@chriseth  I believe that we could rewrite the `Block* m_currentBlock` / `size_t m_latestStatementInBlock` logic into a single `vector<Statement>::iterator m_latestStatementInBlock`, which should further simplify the code.

Lastly, I don't find a "definite" yul code example that proofs that the ExpressionJoiner requires more than one run. I know that in the `"fullInliner"` tests we have 2 tests that rely on ExpressionInliner to run twice at the end of the chain, but whenever I try extracting this test case to only run this one pass, it's working as it should (I'll give it a further look).
