# [\#5321 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5321) `closed`: CALLDATA for call is packed differently than for canonical calls

# Test case

Compiler: 0.4.25+commit.59dbf8f1.Emscripten.clang
Optimization: on default for Remix IDE

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract Test
{
    function needSu(string somebody) pure public {
        string memory su = "Su";
        assert(keccak256(somebody) == keccak256(su));
    }
    
    function testSolidity() external {
        string memory su = "Su";
        this.needSu(su);
    }
    
    function testCall() external {
        string memory su = "Su";
        bool ret = address(this).call(this.needSu.selector, su);
        assert(ret);
    }
}
```

* Set a breakpoint on `assert()` and run both functions in Remix IDE. Capture the CALLDATA for the inner call.

# Actual outcome

CALLDATA 1: 

**0x57e6193b**000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025375000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

CALADATA 2:

**0x57e6193b**5375000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# Expected outcome

Identical call data

# Discussion

Relevant documentation is at https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/types.html#members-of-addresses

> These arguments are padded to 32 bytes and concatenated.

I am not exactly sure if this explanation of CALLDATA encoding is accurate. (Is `string` actually an array of bytes, or does it only look that way with ABI encoding?) 

At a minimum, the documentation should be updated to explain how this situation (and also `bytes`) differs from what I'm expecting. At a maximum, the compiler is producing incorrect results.

And, of course, #1505 FTW. That ends the need to use call for 90% of cases.

Note that pre-0.5.0, `call` performed its own encoding ("pad to 32 bytes and concatenate") which was different from ABI encoding. We removed this special case for 0.5.0 and now `call` just takes a `bytes` and passes it on as is without modification.

Thank you for this detail, very helpful. That new solution surely looks like less baggage. So for the future this look fixed, closing.
