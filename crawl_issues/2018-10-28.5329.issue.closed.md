:)

I think using these tags from time to time is good, but as long as this is not used by machines, it is fine to be a little inconsistent.

Other opinions?

I found myself prefixing differently (such as `[Yul]`, `[YUL]` and `Yul:` - same for WIP's), The purpose is simply to quickly eye-scanning for tickets of interest (non-automated). I am fine with varying prefixes, too. It's probably also not worth the time finding a consensus among all participants. :)
