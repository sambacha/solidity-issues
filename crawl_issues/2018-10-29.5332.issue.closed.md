# [\#5332 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5332) `closed`: [Yul] Signed comparison operators named illogically in Yul low-level functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8889554?v=4" width="50">[jysdoran](https://github.com/jysdoran) opened issue at [2018-10-29 12:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5332):

## Description

sltu256 and sgtu256 both imply that they are short for "signed less/greater than on unsigned u256" when they should really be lts256 and gts256 to be consistent with other low level Yul functions.
