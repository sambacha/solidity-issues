Closes #5177 . The tests seem to be failing on my end on a clean pull from develop, before this change. Not sure why.

Thanks for the pull request! This fully disables coverage and not only for a release. I think this is probably what we will use for now, but in the future, there should be a switch somehow that disables it only for the release branch or only if `prerelease.txt` is present and empty.

I can try to look into doing a switch if you'd like.
