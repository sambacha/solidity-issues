Have you seen the output of `solc --license` ?

He has a point, we only do it correctly for redistribution in binary form. The v8 license statement should be _somewhere_ in the source code, but I think we should add that to the readme.

Since the binary form is created using some built in text plus copying in `LICENSE`, I think the best way forward is just moving all that into the `LICENSE` file.

If Github won't detect it as GPL-3 anymore, then we can think about splitting it up, because in effect, the complete source/binary is under GPL-3 as the non-GPL-3 parts are license compatible.
