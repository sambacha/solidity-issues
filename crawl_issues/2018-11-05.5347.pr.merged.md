# [\#5347 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5347) `merged`: Remove uses of boost::rational with negative denominator in tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-11-05 11:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5347):

``boost 1.68.0`` throws an exception when supplying negative denominators to the constructor of ``boost::rational``.
I'm pretty confident that this is never done in the actual code (I had a look through all occurrences of ``rational``), but only in the test case adjusted in this PR - if that's true, we can just remove these test cases, but maybe someone should recheck.

Related issue in boost: https://github.com/boostorg/rational/issues/27

This is in fact a bug in boost, but I still think it would be better if the 0.5.0 tests wouldn't fail against the current release of boost... Alternatively we could use boost version ``#ifdef``'s.

Did you add an assert for that?

Actually, I think I missed one place where the denominator might actually be negative during exponentiation - I'll verify and fix it (and add a test). It's the only place we use the constructor with a denominator at all, though, and since we can't add an assertion to boost I think with that upcoming change it'll be fine.

Yes, in fact  ``(-1 / 2) ** (-1)`` triggers the exception.
