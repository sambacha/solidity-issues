# [\#5358 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5358) `merged`: [Yul] Yul objects parser

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-11-07 11:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5358):

Parser for yul objects. Backwards-compatible in that it generates a yul object with only code if it is given only code.

Also modifies the assembly stack and the ``solc --assemble`` functionality to use yul objects.

What is still missing (different PR):
 - implement code generator changes
 - add yul functions to access objects

Can you split the specification change out?

Question: Is the order of sub-objects relevant? Should we retain it? Currently, the printer sorts the sub objects according to the YulString sorting order, which is bad.

We should either sort the sub objects by binary string order or retain the order.

Any opinions?

I don't think the ordering should matter, but I can definitely see that being expected from others, so I would suggest to keep the order it was parsed or the order it was inserted into the AST.

Yep, sounds good! This probably requires some modifications in YulObject. Will work on that next week.

I would suggest that the names of objects and data could be either string literals or identifiers.

About using literal strings or identifiers: I would want to avoid using actual identifiers in code (i.e. in `mstore(0, datasize("subContract"))`) because then we would have different scoping rules for things that otherwise look identical - it should just be fully opaque for things like the optimizer.

If we agree on that, then I think it also makes sense to use the syntax
```
object "objectName" { ... }
```
instead of
```
object objectName { ... }
```

Edit: Replaced "literals" by "identifiers"

Will extract the tests into isoltest.

Wait, you said you do *not* want to use literals in the code (e.g. `"subContract"`), but that it makes sense then to use the syntax `object "objectName"`. I'm a bit confused.

@leonardoalt sorry, I meant to write "identifier" instead of "literal" - updated my comment, please take a look.

In summary, I would propose to change the Yul grammar such that:
 - there is no distinction between top-level and general object (i.e. also the top-level object has to be name)
 - code is not optional

@chriseth I agree with your literal/identifier and grammar points.

OK, then I'll merge this and update the grammar in another PR.

Actually, let me make an addition to the changelog, because the `--assembly` output changed.
