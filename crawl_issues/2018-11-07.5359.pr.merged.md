Closes #5357 

    Eliminate `byte`-typedef and use `uint8_t` in all their places instead.

    This change is made to (easily) be forward compatible with future C++
    standards, in order to allow compiling the code with newer standards at
    some point in the future.

    * Removed the global namespace's `using byte = uint8_t;` line from Common.h
    * Mechanically change all uses of `byte` to `uint8_t`.

    Tested with GCC 7.3 in C++11/14/17 modes :-)
