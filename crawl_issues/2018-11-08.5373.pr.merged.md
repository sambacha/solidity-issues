# [\#5373 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5373) `merged`: Add archlinux run on circleci for testing against current versions of deps.

I think it makes sense to not only test on current ubuntu versions, but also to test against the (close to) most recent versions of our dependencies (i.e. mainly boost, gcc, z3, cvc4). Since Archlinux is rolling-release and provides docker images and there were several issues with build failures on Archlinux and Manjaro in the past, I think adding another test run makes sense.

So the question is: do we want this as an additional CI run that helps in keeping in sync with current releases of dependencies or do we have too many CI runs already and it's sufficient to rely on Leo and me regularly building and testing on Archlinux anyways :-)?

I think it's a good idea. We might not want to run the/all tests, though.

I was considering only running the build at first - that's probably what's most likely to break with newer dependencies (and that would have already caught most issues we had in that regard in the past). However, the latest problem with boost, for example, only became apparent in the tests, so I thought, if I build it, I might as well test it :-).
But yes - we can disable the test run either entirely or only run soltest, resp. only the syntax test part. What do you think would be best?

By the way: I just noticed that even ``gcc`` asks for extracted semantics tests now :-):

```
/root/project/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp: In function 'void __static_initialization_and_destruction_0(int, int)':
/root/project/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp:14050:1: note: variable tracking size limit exceeded with -fvar-tracking-assignments, retrying without
 } // end namespaces
 ^
```

Running "--no-ipc" for now is probably a good idea. At some point, we could switch to running with ipc on a nightly basis on a big number of platforms or something like that.

> build_x86_archlinux shows in the test list, but test_x86_archlinux doesn't

The ``test`` run seems to only show up after the ``build`` run is finished, since it depends on it - not sure why it's different for the existing ``test_x86_linux``, etc., runs...
