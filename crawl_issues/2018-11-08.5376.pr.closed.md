Wow - the static binary with debug information is 380MB now... but well, stripped it's only 23MB and it *does* run on trusty and includes Z3. It should basically run everywhere.
However, the build is still quite hacky (updated cmake, custom built Z3, etc.).

Oh by the way, we have the static build that runs on travis...

We do? Ah! In ``scripts/Dockerfile`` via ``scripts/docker_build.sh`` via ``.travis.yml`` - hadn't seen that :-). ~~That might still dynamically linked against ``libgcc`` and ``libstdc++``, though, and~~ it'll most probably not have Z3 support  - I'll have a look at it.

What is the status here?

Needs a good old rebase. It seemed the tests were passing.

I just rebased and squashed. But yes, it looks like this works.

Can you also build cvc4? :)

@axic Still working on that - so far I ended up with segfaults when statically linking against cvc4 locally. In general it looks like building a static version of cvc4 is more messy than for z3 unfortunately.

Haha.

Can you change the title though?

I'm not sure whether we want to have this as a CI run on every PR or rather just as a nightly one. Originally the idea of this PR was that we could drop trusty builds, since the executable built in this PR will run on trusty.

You could also cache the static z3 build on circleci. @chfast do you have any pointers?

I'll have a look!

Alternatively we could move on to use the aleth build docker image and include z3 in that.

I re-purposed this to only allow static linking with Z3 without a CI run.

~~I still kept the build script, though~~ Moving forward I'd like to create a static PPA build of Z3 in our new static PPA repo instead - that could be used both for our test runs and as a build dependency for our static PPA builds. ~~For that I'd modify the install_static_z3 script to a release_static_z3_ppa script or something like that.~~ (EDIT: I removed the script after all)

Closing for now to be re-done properly.
