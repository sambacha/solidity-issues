**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

Factor out <langutil>, a new [static] library that is shared between libsolidity (solidity language frontend) and future libyul (YUL language frontend)

The motivation behind this is to eliminate circular dependencies in our build system and end up also having a standalone libyul static library (PR following this one).

## CHANGES (AND THOUGHTS)

* moved general purpose language frontend files out of libsolidity/
* **also** moved Scanner and Token, as they're both shared between Solidity and Yul (for now), can be generalized (maybe later, not now)
* introduced new namespace `langutil` and put all underneath it, adapting the users of them
* also added `EVMVersion` out (as it is shared); however, that one should have a namespace such as `eth`  or `evm` as it's actually about the EVM here (could be more appropriate in another folder, but I didn't wanna overdo it here).
* Extracted CharSource into its own header/impl file, with the future vision of potentially having one lexer/token API per language (solidity, yul,) that could share this API in order allow transition from one recognizer to another (forth and back).

It can of course be changed anytime, but does anybody have a better name than ``libsolcommon`` or do you all agree that it's fine? I mean - the idea is to separate things away from solidity, so if someone has a better name we might not want to have ``sol`` in it (not sure what else to call it though).

ErrorReporter, SourceLocation and SecondarySourceLocation are surely compiler frontend utility classes,  Even ParserBase, if it wouldn't depend on Solidity Token type (can be mate template) and Scanner (can be made more generic).

wrt. the naming of `libsolcommon`, I'm much more in favor of `langutil` (language utility) currently. it is containing a lot of non-solidity-related language frontend helper APIs, and yeah, plus Scanner and Token. Except those two, everything else could be used by any language frontend (IMHO)

@chriseth: I actually wanted to change the name to that one, too.

With regards to the directory move I am not entirely convinced (or clear) yet.
Do you mean just for include search path, or moving also the cpp files? I fear people may get confused that langutil "belongs" to libsolidity (it's rather libsolidity depends on langutil, and links against it). The only thing in common (for now) is Scanner/Token. Maybe I am just getting a little confused though.

@christianparpart I think the idea was just to correct the order of includes, so that ``<langutils/*>`` includes come after (i.e. "below") ``<libsolidity/*>`` includes, since we order includes from "specific" to "general". (Am I right @chriseth?)

yep. you may be right @ekpyron . :-)

Exactly, @ekpyron

A lot of the history is not kept with not moving files. Keeping the history is important when trying to find reasons for bugs and when they were introduced. Even though Github doesn’t use `git log —follow`, it can be done on the commandline.

Also I feel that breaking this into 3 parts makes more sense:
- changing namespace
- moving files
- splitting files

`solc --license` currently shows

- please update these paths.
