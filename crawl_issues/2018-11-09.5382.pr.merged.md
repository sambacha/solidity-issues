# [\#5382 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5382) `merged`: Allow mapping arguments for public and external library functions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-11-09 11:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5382):

Fixes #4635.

I may be missing something here, since the description in the issue predicts more changes to be necessary.

Also: the issue is restricted to public library functions - no reason to exclude external ones, though, is there?
Also: do we want to support *returning* mappings from public/external library functions as well? It seems like that would be more involved, but I could think of use cases for that as well (e.g. selecting a mapping from an argument that is a mapping to mappings).

Sure, please also allow external functions and returning mappings. Don't forget changelog (which should be for 0.5.1, I would presume) and documentation.

Do we have syntax tests for: non-storage mapping in a library function?

And all other valid/invalid combinations?

I would say the tests are fine.

Rebased.
