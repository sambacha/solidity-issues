# [\#5383 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5383) `closed`: [WIP-do-not-review-just-yet] compile in C++17 by default

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-11-09 12:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5383):

### Requirements
- [ ] depends on #4441
- [x] must built on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)
- [ ] must compile on any Linux/Ubuntu that we're regularily using. (check up with other distros via Docker soon)

### Changes made
* CMake: if find_package() isn't finding boost, it'll use Hunter (cmake package manager) to build and then find again. This way users already having a sufficient boost version on their OS's don't suffer a boost recompilation. But if no boost is there, Hunter will kick in and help you get started.
* `install_deps.sh`: this script makes sure libboost-all-dev isn't installed, because cmake takes care of it. This step was done because Ubuntu 14.04's boost 1.54 isn't conform to c++ and newer compilers do detect that; this script now also installs cmake 3 as well as a newer GCC.
* Changed compiler mode from c++11 to c++17

Part of #5913.

I kind of have a bad feeling about adding hunter - I don't want to introduce too many dependencies from sources whose trust level cannot be properly established.

@chriseth I do agree, btw, but I checked on how we're doing that in all the other repos were having under our org. So it wouldn't be too new wrt. getting support.

OTOH, it's also actually doing something **iff* there's no Boost installed on your system. Then it'll try installing a boost version.

Actually, this should be much easier and might just work when rebased against our latest changes, don't you think :-)?

@ekpyron are you sure this will work on the ppa? :)

@chriseth As a matter of fact, this will break the xenial build, so we would need to use static binaries for xenial as well - otherwise it should be fine. But I wouldn't do it for the current release anyways - but it would be nice to see whether it would work apart from that and we could consider it for the next release.

I'd expect the VS2015 build to break as well.

@ekpyron as we can easily recreate this PR, we're closing it now. and resume motivations once Emscripten target is ready for C++17.
