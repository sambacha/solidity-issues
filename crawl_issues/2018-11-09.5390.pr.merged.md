# [\#5390 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5390) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Unroll loops once

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2018-11-09 17:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5390):

Currently the SMT checker unrolls the loop once and resets knowledge.
This PR:
- Keeps that as an execution branch (one unroll) which merges with the branch that skips the loop and does not clear previous knowledge.
- Moves the loop comment regarding knowledge erasing to a `SecondarySourceLocation` (does not show in tests).
- Adds more tests.

@chriseth Updated. I had missed something in the constant check discussion, and now I see that the trivial condition case is indeed safe if we reset the touched variables. Keeping both checks.
