I agree that it should be more clear what is going on regarding LLL.

> Mention in a prominent position that LLL is not directly related to Solidity (Do not assume that everyone knows. )

Do you have a suggestion where?

> Make Compilation & Tests related to LLL code an option (can be by default ON, to be backwards compatible).

This is a good idea.

> Move all LLL code into an ONE folder (ideally including the tests)

Moving the tests is a bad idea though.

> Move LLL code to an own repository

A replacement is in the works and eventually it will be removed from Solidity. It cannot be split out without code duplication and nobody is willing to do work to split it and to maintain it afterwards.

LLL is still heavily used by the ethereum testing infrastructure.
