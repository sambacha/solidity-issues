# [\#5403 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5403) `closed`: Add jump in marker to jump from arg decoder to function

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-11-13 09:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5403):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5379

Add "jump in" marker at the jump from the argument decoder to the function itself.

Currently, every function has a "jump out" marker at the return statement. The "in" marker is at the call site. If the function is called internally, the markers are symmetric, but they are not symmetric if the function is called externally, i.e. there is no marker at jump from the calldata decoder to the internal part of the function.
