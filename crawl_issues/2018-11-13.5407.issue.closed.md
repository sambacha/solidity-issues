Currently, unused stack slots are only assigned to be re-used if the variable that occupied it was declared in the current scope. The reason behind was that the stack layout has to be he same at control flow joins. This can be improved in the following two ways:

 - allow reuse of stack slots if there is no issue with control flow (for example simple nested blocks)
 - allow reuse of stack slots of function parameters

It might also be worthwhile rewriting the EVMCodeTransform for the special case of strict assembly.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
