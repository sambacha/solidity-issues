Steps:

* [x] `override` for public state variables, but they can't be `virtual` #7839

* [x] `virtual`
* [ ] common base / cut vertex - override exception

draft of specification:
 - interface functions are always virtual implicitly
 - functions coming in from different bases are disallowed, unless they override the same function in a shared base
 - public state variables can override external virtual functions, but need to be marked "override", but cannot be marked virtual themselves. (can they be overridden again?)
 - overriding an "override" function is fine
 - private functions cannot be overridden at all (virtual and private cannot be combined, and private functions are "visible" for overriding detection)
- functions without implementation still need `virtual`

How to handle combinations of overloading and overriding?

I tend to make functions that are marked ``override`` not overridable themselves unless they are again explicitly marked ``virtual`` again. Otherwise we need to think about whether we need an additional ``final`` keyword and I think just sticking to "only things *explicitly* marked ``virtual`` can be overriden" is easier and better than doing that... if overriding state variables are allowed to be overwritten again, that may be an issue though - but maybe that shouldn't be possible anyways (not sure about that)...

And I think it makes sense to introduce the keywords themselves in 0.6.0, but to only deprecate omitting them. So in 0.6.0 omitting the keywords would cause warnings, unless you specify e.g. ``pragma legacy;`` or ``pragma ignore deprecated;`` or sth like that and these warnings turn into errors with 0.7.0. That may be a good way to get around the adoption and real-world testing problem and if it works well we could re-use the concept for future changes.
EDIT: maybe even ``pragma compat 0.5;``

Will this info (e.g. a function being `virtual`) be available in the contract artifacts? It'd interesting if we were able to e.g. have tests asserting a certain function is `virtual` to prevent regression errors.

What do you exactly mean by that?

I guess the most appropriate location for such a thing would be the JSON AST (which is included in the `.json` file that results from compilation when using e.g. truffle).

To recap my understanding of the goals:
* `override` to explicitly show that a function is overriding another function from a base
* `virtual` to explicitly _allow_ overriding in a derived function

I would argue that users want to do the `virtual` use case a lot and thus `virtual` would need to be used a lot. If that kind of usage is the default, wouldn't it be smarter to make the other way explicit, e.g. having a `final` keyword to mark a function explicitly as not overridable?

> How to handle combinations of overloading and overriding?

I'd say the overriding function function signature must match the signature exactly, that should include any overloads, too.
Or did I miss a scenario where this isn't enough?

Yes, I think this is how it is handled currently.

About the default: I'm actually not sure if virtual is really that common. In any case, if we do not default to non-virtual, this feature is useless.

Well, yes, my suggestion was to basically use `final` instead of `virtual` with virtual as the default. But if it is less common then my main argument doesn't apply anymore. We should gather some data.

Discussion resulted in relaxation of the requirements for the case of a function being inherited from multiple base classes:

> A function declaration D1 is called a "base function" of a function declaration D2 if they declare the same function, D1 is in a (direct or indirect) base contract of the contract of D2 and no contract in the path through the inheritance graph contains the function.
> 
> If a function has a base function, it needs the "override" specifier and the base function needs the "virtual" specifier (which is implied in interfaces).
> If a function has more than one base functions, the "override" specifier needs to list all contract types of all the base functions.

In addition to that: It is illegal, if a function that is not declared in a contract would have multiple base functions.

I'm still not entirely sure about this case and fine with both options, but I wanted to bring it up once more:
```
contract A { function f() virtual {...} }
contract B is A {}
contract C is B { function f() override {...} }
```
Should this be valid or not? We said Ç¹ot having ``f`` in ``B`` indicates "do everything like the base", but does that mean "always use A's implementation of ``f``" or "inherit the fact that A's ``f`` is``virtual``"?

There's two cases: either ``B`` wants to allow overriding ``f`` or wants to disallow it, the question is what's the default.

Explicit allowing would mean you need to write
``contract B is A { function f() virtual override { A.f(); } }``
if overriding ``f`` in ``C`` should be possible.

Explicit disallowing would mean you need to write
``contract B is A { function f() override { A.f(); } }``
if overriding ``f`` in ``C`` should **not** be possible.

@chriseth Your specification would mean defaulting to allowing. Do we want to do it that way? I'm fine with it, just reconfirming.

I don't have strong arguments for or against the behaviour that `contract C is A {}` leads to `C` essentially having the same virtual/override behaviour as `A`, but I have the feeling that it is the expected behaviour.

Defaulting to disallow has the advantage that looking at a contract will tell you everything that a derived contract can change about it... Otherwise you'll have to look at the bases as well...
But yeah, I'm not sure what's better myself.

I was just looking over the draft PR(s) for implementing this - and I'm realizing: requiring to redeclare functions of the base "virtual" again to allow them to be overridden would make the implementation much simpler, since we'd only need to check one level at a time :-). And by the same logic I could imagine that this would make auditing code easier, so I'm actually still leaning towards that option...

One option that will get us around discussing which should be the default is to allow both, i.e. to have "virtual" and "final" inheritance, but I'm not sure, if we should seriously consider that :-).

if` B is A` , B should inherit everything from A, which means `B.f` should also be `virtual`

How would this work in the case of an overloaded functions? Is this portion of the spec still being considered?

@ericDeCourcy currently, overloading and overriding are considered to be unrelated. We might want to restrict this, but probably not for 0.6.0.

Our current specification has one hole:
```
contract A {
  function f() external {...}
}
contract B {
  function f() external {...}
}
contract C is A,B {
  function f() external override(A,B) { /* wants to call A.f, but can't */ }
}
```

Which we could solve be allowing
``function f() external override(A,B) = A.f;``
Which would also be nice to have for non-external functions.

Sounds good! I would not allow anything like `A.g` for now, but we might in the future.

Do we want this for 0.6.0 as well?
