Shall we also clarify the difference between `variable` and `value` in general? I think we can assume knowledge about generic terms in programming languages. If there is a good place to add, we can add a half-sentence, though.

Attempted this here - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5450

It doesn't go into detail of the comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5425#issuecomment-438705477 but tries to set out why we use what term and then stick to that consistency. There might be some follow up commits in other areas of docs, but wanted to get opinions first.

@lazaridiscom Hmm, I did some reading around this and looked at what some other docs do, and they all do something different ðŸ¤£.

I am also starting to feel that `value` makes more sense, as that's what is returned. For example the Javascript docs use [value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return).

The solidity-specific content could go into more detail if @chriseth feels people need to know that.

I'm also unsure if the below is particularly clear, but maybe that's a seperate conversation.

> functions may also return an arbitrary number of values as output

The `Function Parameters` section clarifies a little more, but a good example might be what's needed to make all the solidity-specific differences clear.
