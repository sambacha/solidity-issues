# [\#5427 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5427) `merged`: Factor out langutil, a new static library that is shared between libyul/libsolidity

Factor out <langutil>, a new [static] library that is shared between libsolidity (solidity language frontend) and future libyul (YUL language frontend)

The motivation behind this is to eliminate circular dependencies in our build system and end up also having a standalone libyul static library (PR following this one).

**NOTE:** This is a recreation of PR #5381 that performs the changes incrementally:
1.  Isolating the files into its own directory (`liblangutil/`)
2. Splitting out new files (for `CharStream` API)
3. Introducing namespace `langutil`
4. Making the new directory its own modular static library.

This PR is also a prerequisite for the #5399 (libyul as static library, eliminating circular dependencies)

## CHANGES (AND THOUGHTS)

* moved general purpose language frontend files out of libsolidity/
* **also** moved Scanner and Token, as they're both shared between Solidity and Yul (for now), can be generalized (maybe later, not now)
* introduced new namespace `langutil` and put all underneath it, adapting the users of them
* also added `EVMVersion` out (as it is shared); however, that one should have a namespace such as `eth`  or `evm` as it's actually about the EVM here (could be more appropriate in another folder, but I didn't wanna overdo it here).
* Extracted CharSource into its own header/impl file, with the future vision of potentially having one lexer/token API per language (solidity, yul,) that could share this API in order allow transition from one recognizer to another (forth and back).

Can I rebase this to move some changes between two commits?

@axic please go ahead! The faster this gets merged, the better.

Fixed a couple of things, but not everything.

In general my issue was that the last commit, titled as introducing `langutil` namespace suggest it is a tiny change, however it also does the following:
- Changes constructor style from `()` to `{}` for sourcelocation (newer C++)
- Introduces a lot of new system includes without explanation
- Changes the API of the Scanner to take source as value (with move) as opposed to as a reference

I think in general it is a bad idea hiding so many unrelated changes in a single commit.

Extended the commit log for the last commit to explain all those other changes. Next time however I think it makes sense to split them properly.
