Actually, I don't think we should be this excessive in replacing ``push_back`` with ``emplace_back``. For PODs like ``int``s it doesn't really make a difference and in general I think we should only use ``emplace_back`` when we can actually prevent a (costly) copy with it.
Some argument for keeping ``push_back`` unless there is an actual benefit from ``emplace_back`` can be found here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/36919571

A lot of the changes in this PR are constant references that will be copied with ``emplace_back`` and with ``push_back`` alike or PODs for which moving and copying is essentially the same, so for all of these I would keep the ``push_back``. There are some ``std::string`` constructions from string literals and ``std::pair`` constructions (although we could also skip the ``make_pair``, if we use ``emplace_back`` for them) for which changing to ``emplace_back`` definitely make sense, though.

So my thought would be to reduce the changes to only the few ones that (at least theoretically - in practice it probably won't make much of a difference anyways) really benefit from ``emplace_back`` - what do the others think? [I requested reviews from the whole team, since in the end this is basically a style decision we have to make]

I talked to the other team members and we generally lean towards only changing to ``emplace_back`` in cases where it actually saves a copy (which will be fewer cases than in the current version of this PR and which has to be evaluated on a per-case-basis).
@Mordax Are you interested to update this PR towards that goal?

@ekpyron Yes, I am fine with that, that's something I noticed as well. I'll try to go through the gauntlet and hunt down the use cases that makes sense, performance wise.

Closing for now, it is a simple search-replace PR and can be easily recreated.
