I'm not exactly certain what to do about the codecov failing, if someone wants to fill me in on that.

I was wondering what happens if a subclass so far used `virtual override` and now it is changed to `override` only, how does that affect a subclass of the subclass?

Did a tiny experiment and it seems everything is alright, at least on my computer:
```
#include <stdio.h>

class X {
public:
  virtual unsigned test() { return 1; }
  unsigned testCall() { return test(); }
};

class Y : public X {
public:
  unsigned test() override { return 2; }
};

class Z : public Y {
public:
  unsigned test() override { return 3; }
};

int main() {
  X x;
  Y y;
  Z z;

  printf("%d %d %d\n", x.testCall(), y.testCall(), z.testCall());
}
```

@christianparpart @ekpyron can you also double check this PR?

@axic Yeah, [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/virtual) seems to structure it like this, from what I've researched, it seems like the proper way to format it - virtual in base class, override in derived. Although of course, I'd hate to accidentally add in some strange behaviour. Still not sure what the worsened code coverage is all about.

@Mordax you can just ignore codecov ;)
