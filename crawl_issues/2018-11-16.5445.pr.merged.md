# [\#5445 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5445) `merged`: Allow overwriting external functions (with ``calldata`` arguments) with public functions (with ``memory`` arguments)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-11-16 13:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5445):

Closes #5350. Closes #4870. Closes #4832.

Seems to work already, but I may be missing some required changes in ``NameAndTypeResolver``, etc.
Also some more tests with a more complex inheritance graph may make sense.

~~I think #5350 was a duplicate of #4870, so this also closes #4870.~~ (ok now @leonardoalt already closed it anyways :-))

TODO: verify that all aspects of all the issues involved are in fact solved, especially the ``Error not thrown for no matching implementation`` in #4832.

One thing to check is how super behaves with an external function being overwritten by a public one:
```
contract A {
    uint x;
    function f() external {
        x = 2;
    }
}
contract B is A {
    function f() public {
        super.f();
    }
}
```
also with reference types as parameters!

If you don't mind, I would like to try to implement this in a slightly different way, that allows us to re-use `hasEqualParameterTypes`: I will try to add a function to `FunctionType` that returns a new function type which changes all calldata parameters to memory parameters.

Isn't that basically what ``copyForLocation(DataLocation::Memory, m_isPointer)`` does? And ``canOverwrite`` is basically the same as ``hasEqualParameterTypes``,  but ignoring the ``calldata``/``memory`` difference... but in any case: feel free to reimplement this! And yes, I have the feeling that we need to clean up the AST interface with regards to this stuff at some point...

@ekpyron yes, it is very similar to what is here currently, with the difference that `hasEqualParameterTypes` can still be used.

Somehow, the error "Overriding function visibility differs" is produced for `function f() external {}` in the base and `function f() public {}` in the derived class, but the source compiles fine for `function f(uint[] calldata) external {}` in the base and `function f(uint[] memory) public {}` in the derived. I don't think this is related to this change, though.

Found the reason for the weird failure: `TypeChecker::checkFunctionOverride` starts with
```
  if (!functionType.hasEqualParameterTypes(superType)) return;
```
and thus it does not perform any checks if we have calldata in one function and memory in the other.
I think this is another argument for creating a new function type and running the checks on that one.

Ah! `asMemberFunction` already does exactly what we need.
