# [\#5446 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5446) `closed`: Internal compiler error during YUL AST analysis
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2018-11-16 19:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5446):

## Description

The ASM analyzer throws an InternalCompilerError exception while analyzing the AST of the following YUL code:

```
{jump(0)}
```

The exception is thrown at `libsolidity/inlineasm/AsmAnalysis.cpp:613` as seen in this stack frame

```
#12 0x63ba17 in dev::solidity::assembly::AsmAnalyzer::warnOnInstructions(dev::solidity::Instruction, dev::SourceLocation const&) /src/solidity/libsolidity/inlineasm/AsmAnalysis.cpp:613:3
```

The relevant code snippet is shown below:

```cpp
void AsmAnalyzer::warnOnInstructions(solidity::Instruction _instr, SourceLocation const& _location)
{
...
			+ "\" instruction is only available for Constantinople-compatible VMs. " +
			"You are currently compiling for \"" +
			m_evmVersion.name() +
			"\", where it will be interpreted as an invalid instruction."
		);

	if (_instr == solidity::Instruction::JUMP || _instr == solidity::Instruction::JUMPI || _instr == solidity::Instruction::JUMPDEST)
	{
		solAssert(m_flavour == AsmFlavour::Loose, ""); // <- Exception thrown
...
```

- The value of `m_flavour` is `AsmFlavour::Strict` at the time of the assertion check

## Environment

- Compiler version: develop commit `460c58fb`
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): na
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: na
- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ yulopti --input-file <yul_code_shown_above>
```
