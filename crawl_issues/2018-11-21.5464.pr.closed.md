# RFC

libyul as static library, eliminating circular dependencies

### NOTES

* This PR is based on my prior PR  (#5427) to factor out shared bits (error reporting, ...), which must be merged beforehand.
* I had to fully (and manually ;-( ) recreate this PR as I've been recreating #5427, too, which is a prerequisite of this PR.
* This PR deprecates #5399.

@christianparpart I think this PR has similar issues, mixing a lot of changes into single commits :)
