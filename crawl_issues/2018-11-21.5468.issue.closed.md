Different error kinds and exceptions are formatted differently and with different level of detail in the CLI vs in the StandardCompiler.

CLI: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L1503
StandardCompiler: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L942

The goal here is to make the CLI output similarly detailed as the StandardCmpiler.

This could be superseded by #9583.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
