# [\#5471 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5471) `merged`: Add FunctionSort and refactors the solver interface to create variables

Split from #5387 

This PR creates `FunctionSort` and refactors the solver interface with respect to variable creation.
Before we had a `declare*` and a `new*` function for each type (function, `int`, `bool`). Now we only have `declareVariable` and `newVariable` where the `Sort` must be given. This makes the code much simpler, especially when the SMTChecker itself supports function types and mappings.

The reason why `Z3Interface` still keeps `m_constants` and `m_functions` is that they have different internal types, whereas `CVC4` uses the same internal type for functions and variables.
