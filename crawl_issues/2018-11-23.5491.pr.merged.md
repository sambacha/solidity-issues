#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-11-23 11:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5491):

So. After having merged the liblangutil PR now, the changes however, wracked out my second attempt for this PR here, so I had to [unfortunately] do it again....

Please have a look, and if fine, click accept, or, if not, tell me what I can improve on.

Deprecates #5464.

FYI: There are two places where I had to explicitely say `yul::Instruction` because in MSVC it couldn't find the right one. That is because we're actually having the `Instruction` type name twice, in `yul` and in `dev::solidity` (from libevmasm, which, IMHO, I'm not sure I prefer having that library sharing the same namespace with the language frontend, solidity).
