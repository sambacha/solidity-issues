AsmCodeGen.cpp uses evmasm::Assembly, even though it is in the yul namespace. The evmasm::Assembly is immediately converted to a subclass of AbstractAssembly via the EthAssemblyAdapter. I think the EthAssemblyAdapter should be moved to e.g. the evmasm namespace (inside libevmasm) and then used from the site that calls AsmCodeGen, so that AsmCodeGen just receives an AbstractAssembly instance.

This link seems to be broken.

that's a bug in the github UI. I just clicked a button. will extend that with the proper text (on Monday I guess).

@christianparpart `AbstractAssembly` depends on `evmasm::Instruction`. There seems to be a lot of cross-referencing here.

Lately a few changes were merged to reduce interdependency (mostly to reduce dependency on libevmasm from within libyul), however there is a PR which does the converse, adds dependency on libyul from libevmasm. That would be the first instance, and it is not merged yet.

It seems we cannot remove dependency on libevmasm anytime soon from libyul, so I would argue that making this dependency bidirectional is a bad idea and that this current issue is a bad idea too in the current situation.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
