@ekpyron I agree with regards to making use of `make_unique<>` (once it's there), but that issue i'm reference is about implementing our own version of make_unique.
Either we rename that ticket (to: "make use of make_unique<>()") or we just create a new one that we can than handle separately. :)

The ticket is currently titled "Implement **and use**..." - we can just remove the "implement" part after this PR (or close it and create a new one for the "use" part - but we should track that somehow).

Postponing to 0.5.2, too dangerous this close to the release.

The PPA doesn't include static boost libraries, but only shared libraries.
For me in a trusty docker image, cmake will find boost if we set ``Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS`` to ``OFF``.

So I see two ways to move forward:
  - Build with shared boost (maybe even by default - why is static boost the default anyways? I already rased that question in #4589 without any answer - and if we allow our ppa to depend on a newer ``libstdc++`` why not on shared boost libs as well, if the debian build system handles all that well automatically anyways?).
  - Find a PPA that contains static libraries.

Interestingly I would in general ask the question: do we want to move towards more static or more towards shared linking to deps for PPAs? If the answer is static, we can use a static libstdc++ as well, skip the trusty build and reuse a static bionic ppa build for trusty - if the answer is shared, I guess we might as well use shared linking against boost.

I would say since dynamic linking is recommended in debian-based system (and we build a half-way proper package there), let's stick to dynamically linking boost for the PPA and static for everything else.

Re-triggering one of the travis runs. It seems the tests resulted in an infinite loop or something like that.

It looks like the IPC tests do not run properly on trusty.

Hopefully the last commit does it - I'm actually not quite sure how aleth could run before without explicitly installing libleveldb...
For reference: This happened when temporarily running aleth in foreground: https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity/jobs/465969360

I think defining the "install" and "before install" fields under "matrix" in ``.travis.yml`` overwrites the later definitions and ``install_deps.sh`` will not be called. I think I'll move what's there to ``install_deps.sh`` instead.

Actually ``install_deps`` is a bit of a mess IMHO, so I added the missing dependencies to the travis configuration instead.

@chriseth Yes, but it's only failing, because the PR enables running the end-to-end tests on travis/trusty again - I think they were actually disabled before (and it probably makes sense to have them, at least, for this particular PR). Just pushed another commit that might make everything work, let's see.

Ok - the clang run is still failing.
EDIT: Ok - that was due to depending on libstdc++ as well. Another try.

~~Ok, now the clang tests are starting to get worrisome...~~
Now it looks good. Let's see whether it's stable.
