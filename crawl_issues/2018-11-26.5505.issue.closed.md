# [\#5505 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5505) `closed`: Make include resolution blazing fast

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-11-26 12:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5505):

There should be an option to perform "include resolution only" - it might be that not selecting any output could already do that, but I think it will still do type checking. It might also be that if any include fails, we do not do anything at all.

Task of this issue:
 - check that truffle (and other framework)'s include resolution is as fast as it gets.
