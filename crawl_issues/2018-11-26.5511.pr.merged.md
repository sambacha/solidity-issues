# [\#5511 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5511) `merged`: [solc] colorized diagnostics output

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2018-11-26 23:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5511):

This PR is a resurrection of #3046 and their related #4338 and #4340.

* ANSI coloring (termcolor): I didn't copy'n'paste the original one (which requires a additional license), but hacked together our own, that fits our needs
* SourceReferenceFormatter: greatly refactored to:
  * have improved diagnostics output format (this includes also streamlining line-truncation, as mentioned in #5169 (which we can close then).
  * support colored output
* solc: adds `--color` for forced colorized output and `--no-color` for explicitly disabling terminal-autodetection, e.g. if none of these will be given, the diagnostic output will be colored when stdout/stderr is connected to a terminal.

The test failure is not about strcmp: `Unknown exception during compilation.`. Also colouring should be disabled whenever output does not go to a terminal.

Also, could you split up source reference formatter into two components: One that just does source extraction, cropping and other things (and returns structured data) and one that adds the colour formatting?

@chriseth it was late night (almost morning? :-D). I just noticed tests failing with some error. I'll look into that tomorrow. Thanks :)

WRT not enabling color when output streams aren't a terminal, that's actually already happening (unless there is a bug inside), you can force colors regardless of that with `--color` CLI option to solc, or force disabling (i.e. no auto-enabling if stdout/stderr is connected to terminal).

The source extraction split-out I can do.

Sounds good, but please split it up.

Is it possible to test the colour output (including the options to enable and disable it)?

I really think this should use FormattedScope instead. We can perhaps discuss next week.

I think there is still an inconsistency with regards to spacing between the errors.
This is how errors with secondary source locations are formatted:
```
Warning: Source file does not specify required compiler version! Consider adding "pragma solidity ^0.5.4;"
 --> /tmp/x.sol:1:1: 
  |
1 | contract c {
  | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
Error: Identifier already declared.
 --> /tmp/x.sol:3:1: 
  |
3 | int x = 3;}
  | ^^^^^

Note: The previous declaration is here:
 --> /tmp/x.sol:2:32: 
  |
2 | function f(uint) public pure { int x = 2;
  |                                ^^^^^

Error: No matching declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
 --> /tmp/x.sol:5:27: 
  |
5 | function g() public pure{ f();}
  |                           ^

```

And this is how it looks without an error with secondary source location:
```
Warning: Source file does not specify required compiler version! Consider adding "pragma solidity ^0.5.4;"
 --> /tmp/x.sol:1:1: 
  |
1 | contract c {
  | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
Error: No matching declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
 --> /tmp/x.sol:4:27: 
  |
4 | function g() public pure{ f();}
  |                           ^

```

I would have expected the secondary source location to be appended without an empty line between the main location and the secondary location.

Also we might want to add an empty line between two errors (actually this is how your screenshot in the description has it).

If we make more changes to this anyways, then I vote for changing the command line argument from ``--new-reporter`` to ``--fancy-reporter`` as @chriseth just suggested in the office ;-).

Oh and another thing I just noticed: At least in the screenshot in the description, the line numbering it says `t.sol:3:...` but then on the left there is a `2`. I think lines should be numbered starting from 1 in both cases.

Ah ok, but the thing I pasted at least has it right.

Output is now as follows:
```

Note: Other declaration is here:

I also verified that the old reporter is used with standard-json.

P.S. @chriseth I didn't rename it to `--fancy-reporter`, even though I really very much liked the idea, but I'd rather prefer to see this reporter becoming standard at some point in the future (not necessarily the very next breaking release)

I guess the plan is to make it the default starting from 0.6.0
