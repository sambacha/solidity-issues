It seems the Travis test is failing because it's trying to run the script in a docker image, would it be possible to know which docker image it's pulling? I've looked at the test directory and can't find it there.

The docker image is `docker pull trzeci/emscripten:sdk-tag-1.37.21-64bit` - but how would that be relevant?

Given that the Travis CI is not a required test maybe it's not needed but I thought I'd have to fix the issues that made the travis test fail before merging

Waiting for travis to run and will squash and merge afterwards.
