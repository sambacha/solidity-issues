# [\#5515 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5515) `closed`: Removes gas estimation from AST output

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5501

The Heisenbug (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3718 was re-introduced by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5225. After a quick discussion with @chriseth, it turned out that removing the gas estimation output completely seems to be a good option, since it is (most likely) not used by anyone and would fix (hide) the Heisenbug once and for all :)

It is not really fixing the bug just hiding it by removing one of the places it commonly occurs :)

@axic Yeah, you're right ;)

@axic the bug is not in the code, but in the standard library, at least that's what we hope...

If we remove this code (which is not even used by standard-json), we can also get rid of the old control flow graph analyzer which has some nasty runtime complexity issues ( #4058 ).

I'm not sure this represents a breaking change because it only affects the very obsolete text output.

Why aren't we just pretty formatting the compact JSON output?  Why is this not affecting that?

Is it better to just display "infinite" gas cost instead of removing the lines? Will anybody be affected by this?

Concerning the "Will anybody be affected by this". The only reason I run into an issue with is was because I am using https://github.com/BlockCatIO/solidity-flattener to flatten contract sources. Most of the other flatteners try using their own magic of building a dependency graph, which is to simplistic for our contract and therefore they don't work. Solc on the other hand does this properly and therefore this flattener is working for us.

By removing the `Gas costs` this tools would break (https://github.com/BlockCatIO/solidity-flattener/blob/development/flattener/core.py#L13) 

This is probably easy to fix, so it might be unncessary worry (sadly the tool is unmaintained ... so we would need to fork that)

Thank you very much for the pointer, @rmeissner ! We now know that it will at least break some dependants. Also changing it to "infinite" won't help because the regex (wrongly?) uses `\d` to match the gas cost value while "infinite" would translate to `[???]`.

So if we would have to adjust that tool anyway, we can also remove the gas costs altogether.

@axic somehow these structural gas costs were not included in the ast-json, but only in the classic ast output. I don't know why.

@chriseth I agree ... also maybe it is good to write a new version of that tool that uses the ast-json :D

@rmeissner we should actually provide "include resolution" as a feature of the compiler....

The flattener is only needed because Etherscan doesn't want to support directory structures for verification.

What we could provide is creating a "standard json" file on CLI from sources and ask Etherscan to support standard json. That is a self contained file.

I think we can postpone this discussion a little bit ;) As it turned out, the SEGFAULT was caused by a defect and should be fixed with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5530. Will close this in favor of the other PR.
