# [\#5530 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5530) `merged`: Fixes crash on empty runtime code.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2018-11-28 13:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5530):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5501.

Apparently, the crash was not caused by the Heisenbug, but by an illegal memory access if no runtime assembly items were returned (as is it the case for the contract that seg-faulted on the users machine).
