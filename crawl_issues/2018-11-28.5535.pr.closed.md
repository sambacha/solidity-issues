adds SourceReferenceExtractor API to liblangutil.

This is a prerequisite of #5511 - and can be merged early.

FYI: that API could receive get some tests. maybe in the PR or another?.

Why did you not modify SourceReferenceFormatter? I thought it was a refactor. Also there seem to be still some TODOs in the code.

@chriseth, it is, but that's a splitout of the bigger PR. the code changes of the SourceReferenceFormatter are in the main PR. you asked me to split a few commits out.
