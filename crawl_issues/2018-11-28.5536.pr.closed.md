# [\#5536 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5536) `closed`: Add decimal suffixes to YulStrings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19492578?u=8c55e77eeb572dbfddf30ba202f1c6d23be8e278&v=4" width="50">[robechun](https://github.com/robechun) opened issue at [2018-11-28 22:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5536):

Fixes #5372 

### Description
- YulStringRepo has a mapping from ID -> suffix. This allows for unique YulStrings but the suffixes can be added as part of the "string name" when we do `.str()`.
- YulString creation now takes in a suffix as an additional parameter.
- NameDispenser looks at "last suffix seen" and uses that to create YulStrings (instead of having to search for one that isn't a duplicate).

**Note: this is currently failing**
