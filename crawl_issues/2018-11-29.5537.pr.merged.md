This pr is the earliest in the series of PRs that needs to be merged "in order" :-).

**Motivation:** I noticed, that we pass (CharStream, filename) almost always as pair to Scanner, and then use complex ways (via callback functions) to get back to some functions that can extract the source code fragments (duplicated API from CharStream into Scanner) inside the SourceReferenceFormatter.

**Gains**:
* So the idea now is, to not pass CharStream **and** a source name to the scanner, but to simply pass a CharStream, that already knows the source name, to the Scanner.
* This should eliminate the callback workaround as SourceLocation will have access to the CharStream already.

Prerequisite of: #5535 (is based on top of this PR)
