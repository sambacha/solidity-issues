# [\#5545 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5545) `closed`: Allow the 'calldata' type in internal/private/public functions

## Abstract

If I have data which is read-only in calldata solidity will copy it to memory anyways when passing it to internal/private/public functions. 

## Motivation

If read-only calldata is copied for memory for no reason (it should only be copied to memory if it is edited - if it is read-only calldata it should never be copied) this wastes gas. If this happens, it should only be read from calldata and not waste gas on copying to memory.

## Specification

The public/internal/private function types should allow data (such as `bytes` or `string`) to be passed as `calldata` type. If this data is ever edited in the code, then the compiler should throw since this cannot be compiled: if it is explicitly passed as calldata this data is then read-only. If the user wishes to edit data, they should manually put it into a `memory` type of data.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is incompatible with sol < 0.5 since `calldata` is not a valid keyword there.

Note that a prerequisite to this is fully implementing support for calldata types in the first place. For now, only one-dimensional arrays are supported.

For calldata variables we have a similar problem as with storage pointer variables: They cannot be properly auto-initialized and have to be assigned before they can be accessed.

Although it might be useful to auto-initialize them to `calldatasize()`.
