I found that conversions from literals to fixed-point types has not been documented here [Types > Conversions between Literals and Elementary Types](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#conversions-between-literals-and-elementary-types).

Thanks a lot! In general, it sounds like the better approach to check if the number itself is convertible, especially in the case of `0.01` it makes total sense, but there are some tests that should not fail, or at least we should be able to explain why they do.

Hi, I have no idea why or what test is failing. Anyone could help?

I think it migth be failing because you did not rebase on top of the latest version.
