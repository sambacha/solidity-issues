This bug might prompt to re-think the whole `super`-concept here. Consider the following contracts:
```
contract A {
    uint x;
    function f() public;
}
contract B is A {
    function f() public {
        super.f();
        x++;
    }
}
contract C is A {
    function f() public {
        x++;
    }
}
contract D is B, C {
}
contract E is C, B {
}
```

This seems to be classic diamond problem

@anurag-git no, the diamond problem is solved. The problem is that `super` is a static type when it actually should not.

@chriseth, So we need to fix something as part of this PR, or take this issue separately

Actually having thought about it, it does make sense to only allow the user of `super` if there is an implementation.

I will rebase and add another test.
