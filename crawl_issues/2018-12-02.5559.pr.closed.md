Fixes #5372
_Re-doing PR 'cause I messed up some git stuff_
_althought I think I might have messed up on this one as well..._

## Description
- YulStringRepo's `m_strings` is a pair of `string, suffix`
- NameDispenser keeps track of suffixes already used and assigns the next correct order.

## TODOs/Concerns:
- [ ] Disambiguator tests all pass, but other tests that require disambiguator to work seem to fail. Can't figure out why. (throws exceptions)
- [ ] NameDispenser currently filters strings that is prefixed like `a_1` by getting rid of `_1` and passing that into the `newNameInternal` function. Perhaps there's a better way? **see `YulOptimizerTests/disambiguator/variables_clash`** for reference.
