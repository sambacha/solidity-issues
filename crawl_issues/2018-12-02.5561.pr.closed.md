Reference to #5372
_Re-doing PR 'cause I messed up some git stuff_

## Description
We generate new names for a variable a during optimization like a_1, a_2, etc. - and that'll happen a lot.
And at the moment the number suffix will be incremented globally, so if you have a_1 and a_2 and then want a new name for a variable called b it will be b_3 and you are left to wonder where b_1 and b_2 are...
This PR works towards making that more efficient and towards having name-specific suffices again.

- YulStringRepo's `m_strings` is a pair of `string, suffix`
- NameDispenser keeps track of suffixes already used and assigns the next correct order.


## Concerns:
- [x] Disambiguator tests all pass, but other tests that require disambiguator to work seem to fail. Can't figure out why. (throws exceptions)
- [ ] NameDispenser currently filters strings that are prefixed like `a_1` by getting rid of `_1` and passing that into the `newNameInternal` function. Perhaps there's a better way? **see `YulOptimizerTests/disambiguator/variables_clash`** for reference.
- [ ] Only one test fails-- `yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/abi_example1` with exception `Source needs to be disambiguated.`

@chriseth I did some profiling on some variants of this (I pushed some of it to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/yulStringOpti in case you want to have a look - I also noticed that we can actually reduce ``YulString`` back to a simple pointer), but actually I haven't found a variant that exhibits noticeably better performance than the others (merely implementing ``YulString`` as plain ``std::string`` is noticably worse)... so we should probably emphasize simplicity and readability instead.

Sad, but sounds good! So we close this? Sorry about that, @Altrum

@chriseth I would still prefer to have suffix counters per variable name instead of global ones - but if we decide that keeping ``YulString`` simple and having more logic in ``NameDispenser`` instead (which probably makes sense), then I guess so, yes.

Actually I'm not sure. I have the impression that especially this line is very inefficient: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/7bf2d4d942deda231e17ec1516e2c9025b6f2d88#diff-8aa69da765f659039810ae67dc3f5659R48

The name dispenser should be able to generate a new unique name without going through the string representation at all. I haven't seen that in your branch either.

Given the fact that this is more complicated than originally anticipated (as explained in #5372), we closed this PR for now, but still thank you very much for the help so far!
If you still want to look into it further, feel free to do so, just let us know and we can continue with a new PR at some point.
