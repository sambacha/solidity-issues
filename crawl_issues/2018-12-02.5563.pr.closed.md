(resent, changed branch-name)

Refactoring

* Split out solidity-related code from boostTest.cpp to SolTestInit.cpp
* added boostTest.h

(This negates the need for workaround #5523 )

It makes sense to extract the utility functions `registerTests` and so, but I think the symbols `main` and `init_unit_test_suite` should be defined in the same `.cpp` file. They provide the bridge from the "system environment" to our test environment. That `.cpp` file could be called `testMain.cpp` or `soltest.cpp` or something like that.

I like your `soltest.cpp` naming suggestion.

As for main/entry-point: The symbols `main` and `init_unit_test_suite` do not need technically to be in the same file. And placing them into the same file would be bad for reuse, because then there is the need to duplicate this workaround for each binary:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c74b48db2023f527efecc9b6201f94bbe1402fe2/test/boostTest.cpp#L127-L140

Now, I went already on to the next step (#5580). Tests pass 100%, both local and on ci, so it should be non-critical to merge now and do any further steps in a later commit. (I would like to avoid renaming, rebasing etc. at this point).

I updated finally. Using `soltest.cpp` make things cleaner. Added docs for the entry-point/main. I'm at 99,9% that its "reused/general code", and that it belongs into `boostTest.cpp`. (and if not, then it can be still moved later).

Closing as requsted.
