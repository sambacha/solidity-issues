# [\#5585 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5585) `merged`: [Yul] Proper recursion in ForLoopInitRewriter.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-12-04 12:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5585):

While working on #5584 I noticed that the for loop init rewriter does not properly recurse and because of that doesn't rewrite all for pre's.

This PR therefore adds the required recursion, adjusts the fullSuite test and adds a new test with nested for's.
