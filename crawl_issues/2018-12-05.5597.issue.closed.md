# [\#5597 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5597) `closed`: YUL optimizer: Out-of-range exception thrown by VarDeclPropagator

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2018-12-05 15:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5597):

## Description

The VarDeclPropagator YUL optimization throws a `std::out_of_range` exception for the code below

```
{
  function f() -> a, b, c {}
  let x, y, z 
  z, x, x := f()
}
// -x }
```

The exception is thrown at `libyul/optimiser/VarDeclPropagator.cpp:121`

```cpp
variables.emplace_back(move(m_lazyInitializedVarDecls.at(varName.name)));
```

- `m_lazyInitializedVarDecls` (maps `YulString` to `TypedName`) at this point is an empty map from which we are trying to index a key called `varName.name`
- This leads to the `'std::out_of_range` exception

The bug is local to `VarDeclPropagator::recreateVariableDeclaration` function which is called within a lambda function called `iterateReplacing` on line 58 of the faulting source file.

## Environment

- Compiler version: develop commit `1e6c368bb`
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): na
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: na
- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04

## Steps to Reproduce

- Run `yulopti` as shown
- Select `d` (vardecl) in the interactive step

```
$ yulopti --input-file <yul_code_shown_above>
----------------------
{
  function f() -> a, b, c {}
  let x, y, z 
  z, x, x := f()
}
// -x }

Closing since the var decl propagator is being removed.
