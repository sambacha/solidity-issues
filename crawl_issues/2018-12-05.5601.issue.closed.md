# [\#5601 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5601) `closed`: [Yul] Tune Optimizer

This seems to be nice assembly code to tune the optimizer on: https://github.com/AztecProtocol/AZTEC/blob/master/contracts/AZTEC.sol

The goals here should be:
 - [ ] code compiles (i.e. not too many local variables)
 - [ ] code is more efficient than the hand-written version
 - [ ] code should still be more or less readable

Ways we can tune are the following:
 - the order of the stages in the optimize suite (the interactive optimizer can help there)
 - adding new stages
 - tuning constants in the function inliner and the rematerializer

The current optimizer creates too many variables. Calling `calldataload` multiple times is actually fine because it is even cheaper than a DUP operation.

I'm moving this out of the current release. The code there is already rather optimized and we should focus on the ABI instead.
