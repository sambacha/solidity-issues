### Description

Make natspec extract information from all functions, not just public/interface ones by iterating over all defined functions instead of just the interface ones.
I haven't modified Natspec::userDocumentation to have the same behavior as natspec comments on private functions are not relevant for users.
This PR fixes issue #3097 

### Checklist

- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary

@corollari it would be great if you could continue working on this. In the meantime, I'm closing this pull request. You can re-open it any time.
