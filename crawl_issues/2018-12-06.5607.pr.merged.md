Thanks for the pull request! Could you explain the purpose of these changes a little more? Note that we do not want to clutter a user's system with our header files when they use 'make install' - not sure if that is the case here.

NIX required the libs and headers to be installed (I'll have to dig into their build system more to understand why) so I removed those for now. But I got linker errors when linking `libyul` and those were fixed by including `evmasm` and `langutil` to `libyul/CMakeLists.txt`.

If ``libyul`` depends on symbols in ``evmasm``, resp. ``langutil`` (which is probably in fact the case), then we should add them here, so I think this PR is a good idea.

``make install`` won't be affected (we don't install any headers and this change won't change that).

Since we don't install any libraries and headers, I guess that our cmake project was just included in another one and then it was linked against the ``yul`` target - that's a perfectly good way to do things, so we should support that - but for that to work the ``yul`` target has to specify all its dependencies.
