I think this is a good middle ground between the convenience of implicit construction from strings and the verbosity of the full constructor.

@chriseth What do you think?

While this looks really nice, I'm not sure whether it would be more confusing than useful, especially given that such constructions are not used that often.

Would like to hear other opinions, though.

It does not only look nice, but moving forward it can potentially have performance benefits:
Once we move to C++14 we can change the user-defined literal operator to a templated version (the signature would be ``template<typename CH, CH... chars> YulString operator "" _yul()``), which we could use to compute the string hash at compile time. Not that this would make a huge difference, but still.
And I don't think it'd be all that confusing, but we can collect opinions on that, I'm requesting more reviews.

In my opinion, if it has no performance benefits I'd stick to the current one. But if we do get performance improvements when C++14 I'd vote for merging.
