# [\#5617 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5617) `merged`: Rework of ControlFlowGraph and analysis.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-12-10 16:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5617):

Closes #4669.

Changes:
  - Use Identifiers, VariableDeclarations (and InlineAssembly) as content of control flow blocks.
  - Store them in order of execution in a vector in the control flow graph.
  - Do not split into function flow and modifier flow, but handle modifier invocations directly.
  - Treat function arguments as declaration + assignment.
  - Treat function returns as accesses.
  - Add an additional access to all return variables at "end of function".
  - Track all unassigned variables and - for storage variables - error out if there is a non-reverting (i.e. returning) code path accessing them.

Note: this change actually means that we could go back and allow declaring local storage pointers without initialization, because we can still prevent uninitialized accesses.


 - [x] Fix declaration+assignment for structs (apparently broken).
      => for local variables the assignment is part of the VariableDeclarationStatement, not the VariableDeclaration.
 - [x] Check and potentially fix test contracts.
 - [x] Think about the "assign variable to itself" workaround (currently this PR disallows it).
 - [x] Maybe struct member access is not yet handled correctly (lValueRequested might not be true for the struct itself). => added test case
 - [x] Think about actually implementing function calls - recursion shouldn't be a problem the way the graph is traversed in the end (the graph is not acyclic anyways). -> I suggest to postpone.
 - [x] Think about a warning for uninitialized use of non-storage variables. -> I suggest to postone
 - [x] Evaluate how much effort it would be to properly handle inline assembly; to do it properly we probably need a yul-control flow graph (but that'd be nice anyways and should be simpler than for solidity); maybe checking for any *write* reference (in contrast to just any reference) would be a simpler step in the right direction. This especially needs to be done for more advanced use cases like mutable/immutable. -> I suggest to postpone.
 - [x] ~~Handle modifier arguments correctly.~~ Seems to be fine.
 - [x] Changelog entry.

~~This one is particularly tricky~~ - ~~``f`` is fine, but ``g`` is bad, but the argument is referred to using a different declaration~~ (seems like they are in fact both bad, which is no problem then):
```
contract C {
    uint[] s;
    modifier postModify(uint[] storage b) {
        _;
        b[0] = 0;
    }
    modifier preModify(uint[] storage b) {
        b[0] = 0;
        _;
    }
    function f() postModify(a) internal returns (uint[] storage a)
    {
        a = s;
    }
    function g() preModify(a) internal returns (uint[] storage a)
    {
        a = s;
    }
}
```
~~Even worse with more involved expressions than just ``a`` in the invocation.
I probably need to replace the arguments in the modifier definition by a local variable + assignment.
Still worse: the local variable + assignment has to only be placed in front of the first use of the modifier parameter, not at the beginning of the modifier.~~

EDIT: Ok, right - this is actually not a problem, since all such accesses indeed seem to be invalid.

Actually: is there any way to assign to a storage pointer in inline assembly (i.e. to specify/change which storage slot the pointer is referring to)? If not and if therefore all references in inline assembly will be read accesses, I will change the current behavior and consider all references to uninitialized storage pointers from inline assembly an error...

@ekpyron they cannot be assigned.

Can you explain why
```
contract C {
    uint[] s;
    modifier preModify(uint[] storage b) {
        b[0] = 0;
        _;
    }
    function g() preModify(a) internal returns (uint[] storage a)
    {
        a = s;
    }
}
```
is not a problem? Or are you saying that you are catching these cases?

@chriseth Yes, I'm catching these cases already at the modifier invocation (so the ``a`` in ``preModify(a)`` is ~~a non-lvalue-write-access~~ (an access which is not an lvalue write) to ``a`` without prior assignment and will trigger an error).
The issue I saw was that the ``postModify`` version might actually be supposed to work, but I checked (at least in remix) and it won't, so my guess was that they should be disallowed as well and that's what the PR currently does.

Right, both do not work, because a modifier invocation is treated as a function call, i.e. the arguments are copied at the point where the modifier is invoked.

I'm a bit puzzled about "non-lvalue-write-access" - shouldn't it be a "non-lvalue-read-access" or are you saying "non-(lvalue-write-access)" instead of "(non-lvalue)-write-access"?

@chriseth Yes, sorry, I meant non-(lvalue-write-access). As in ``!lValueRequested``.
