# [\#5620 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5620) `merged`: [Yul] Use rematerializer if variable is only referenced once or value is "cheap".

Fixes #5310 

Replaces a variable reference by the current value of the variable if it is movable and one of the following conditions hold:
 - the variable is only referenced once
 - the current value has zero cost (executing `caller()` for example is as cheap as just copying the value from the stack)
 - the variable is referenced only five times and is still rather cheap (e.g. a constant that fits in a single byte)

This is not really helpful.

I think this should be revisited, especially in the context of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AztecProtocol/AZTEC/master/contracts/AZTEC.sol it could prove useful.

We could include the actual cost of opcodes like `calldataload` which is REALLY cheap.
