# [\#5626 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5626) `closed`: Use boost 1.67 as ppa dependency.

I'm still no expert in PPA builds, but I guess this should be all that's needed?
We probably need to have some equivalent of ``add-apt-repository -y ppa:mhier/libboost-latest`` in the travis build, but that may have to be using the web interface (to which I don't have access)?
See https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/BuildingASourcePackage#Depending_on_other_PPAs:
``
If you want Launchpad to satisfy your package dependencies using one or more other PPAs, follow the Edit dependencies link on your PPA or the team's overview page.
``

For reference: this is what needs to be fixed:

Actually, do we also need to change ```dh_auto_configure -- -DINSTALL_LLLC=Off -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8```
to
```dh_auto_configure -- -DINSTALL_LLLC=Off -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-8 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DBoost_USE_STATIC_LIBS=OFF```
?
We probably do, don't we? I was under the impression that you guys checked the PPA stuff ;-)...?

Another thing:
```
Replaces: lllc (<< 1:0.3.6)
```
Since we have ``-DINSTALL_LLLC=Off``, should this actually be in there? I don't change it for now and in this PR, since it was like that before as well, but maybe we should remove this (in a separate PR)?

Actually, I still think we should consider doing it like this instead: https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental/+packages
So building packages for newer ubuntu versions with shared linking, but with stock dependencies, and building one static version (that is built on the most current ubuntu) that can be distributed for the old ubuntu versions. In case we want to go that way, I have everything ready for it now.

Going via static builds.
