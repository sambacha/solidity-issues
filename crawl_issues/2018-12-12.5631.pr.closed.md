The failing external test does not seem to be related to the Node.js version. I've tried locally using ``v10.13.0``, but it still fails. I did not fully understand why, but they are using Websockets to communicate with Ganache: 
``networks: {
    development: {
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 8545,
      network_id: '*',
      websockets: true
},``
Could this be related? Do we need to tell Node to use WS?

After thinking about this again, I'd vote for not adding this external dependency at all. It already introduced some maintenance overhead that we should not take care of. I think my standpoint is also pretty much in line with the feedback on our external tests that we got from Zeppelin.

I agree. If it does not work out of the box then let's not add it.
