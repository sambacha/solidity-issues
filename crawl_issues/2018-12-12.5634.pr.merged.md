Note that I did not switch to dynamic linking to boost for now - I think we should do that for the non-static builds, but probably better to do one change at a time.

Also: We can consider building a static z3 and linking against it in the future (somewhat related to that: #5376).

@chriseth Updated.

Once we think the script is fine we can just try to run it before merging the PR and check whether it works.

We have to modify the release checklist as well (should I change it in this PR already?).

Yes, please update the release checklist. We might also want to mention that in the changelog.

Actually the ``versionsuffix`` variable should probably have used a lower-case ``static`` and not ``${distribution}``, which now is ``STATIC`` - but it seems it will be converted to lowercase automatically... Should I change it anyways?

There was an error when running `test_check_style` for commit `49a8c88f4ac5ee08a91585820b33fe7874405144`:
```
Error: Trailing whitespace found:
 ReleaseChecklist.md:13: - [ ] Once the ``~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum-static`` PPA build is finished, copy the static package to the ``~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum`` PPA for the destination series ``Trusty`` while selecting ``Copy existing binaries``. 

```
Please check that your changes are working as intended.
