Array literals are covered in types.rst line 869 but it doesn't mention that you can also do that for state variables outside functions (which is what the removed text does). Maybe a small example can be added to types.rst covering that.

@leonardoalt I actually just wonder if I linked to a misleading place. If you read the docs about State Variables, it tells you to look at each type, and then I think this is handled in each of those discussions, maybe making an extra note unnecessary? Let me know what you think :)
