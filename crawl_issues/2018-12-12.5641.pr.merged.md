Why does this not replace the variable by `0` in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/abi_example1.yul#L502 ?

OK, it seems to have to do with the fact that the common subexpression eliminator cannot really handle this.

It is probably best to
 - introduce a step that explicitly initializes each variable
 - avoid creating variable declarations without value in the optimizer
