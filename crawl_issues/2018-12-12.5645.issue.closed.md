# [\#5645 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5645) `closed`: [Yul] Optimizer step that eliminates variable declarations without value

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-12-12 18:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5645):

This task should introduce a step that replaces each variable declaration without value by a variable declaration with value and also modify existing steps so that they do not generate variable declarations without value anymore. If this is the case, then this step can be run once at the start of the optimizer.

This obsoletes the VarDeclPropagator.

We should check how
```
let a := 0
a := 2
```
is handled by the redundant assignment remover.

Update: It is fine, SSA plus redundant assign eliminator plus unused pruner removes it.
