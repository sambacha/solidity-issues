# [\#5646 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5646) `closed`: Compatibility with most recent emscripten versions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-12-12 19:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5646):

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4441 works and will bump the emscripten version to ``1.38.8`` - however, due to breaking changes in emscripten that's pretty much how far we can go without more changes to our build system and solc-js.

GOAL:
-------
Being able to compile soljson.js with the most recent emscripten release.

Ideally while maintaining (at least some degree of) backwards compatibility.

This can be done independently of the soljson.js release builds and the emscripten CI test runs - being compatible and e.g being able to build locally outside of docker with native arch emscripten would be a big help and nice step forward already.
