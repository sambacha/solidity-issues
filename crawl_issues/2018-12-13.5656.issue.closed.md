# [\#5656 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5656) `closed`: Feature Request: Yul output

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3867501?u=8126b3c609b132f8625faae11480d2f8113f5acb&v=4" width="50">[charles-cooper](https://github.com/charles-cooper) opened issue at [2018-12-13 21:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5656):

## Motivation
It would be nice to be able to inspect the IR of a program to see exactly what it does with memory(/calldata/storage) instead of digging through the asm and additionally needing to reason about the stack, jumps, etc.

## Specification
Add a command-line option to `solc` analogous to `--bin` or `--asm`, but which outputs Yul IR (one output file per input file) instead of asm or bytecode.

This is of course planned as soon as the IR is in place. Standard-json already has a field for it.

Still planned?

No, already implemented: `solc --ir`
