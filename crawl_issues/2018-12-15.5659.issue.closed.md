# [\#5659 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5659) `closed`: UnimplementedFeatureError when using public structs with ABIEncoderV2 and derived contracts
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24527999?v=4" width="50">[coder6423](https://github.com/coder6423) opened issue at [2018-12-15 14:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5659):

I upgraded from 0.4.25 to 0.5 and run into a new UnimplementedFeatureError:

> Unimplemented feature:
> /solidity/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp(347): Throw in function void dev::solidity::CompilerUtils::encodeToMemory(const TypePointers&, const TypePointers&, bool, bool, bool)
> Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<langutil::UnimplementedFeatureError>
> std::exception::what: Encoding type "struct Test.TestStruct memory" not yet implemented.
> [dev::tag_comment*] = Encoding type "struct Test.TestStruct memory" not yet implemented.

This issue can be resolved by adding "pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2" to all derived contracts. 
Minimal Example:


```
--- test1.sol
// pragma solidity 0.4.25;
pragma solidity 0.5.1;

pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract Test {
    struct TestStruct 
    {
        uint a;
    }

    // Compiles fine in 0.4.25, 
    // 0.5.1 makes all derived contracts fail, unless ABIEncoderV2 is in every one of them
    // Making this non-public makes it pass in 0.5.1

    function giveMe() public returns(TestStruct memory){
    }
} 
```
```
--- test-derived.sol
// pragma solidity 0.4.25;
pragma solidity 0.5.1;

// pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
// ^ Compiles fine without this line in 0.4.25 
//   Fails in 0.5.1

import "./test1.sol";
contract TestDerived is Test {

}
```
```
--- test-derived2.sol
// pragma solidity 0.4.25;
pragma solidity 0.5.1;

// pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
// ^ Compiles fine without this line in 0.4.25 
//   Fails in 0.5.1

import "./test-derived.sol";


contract TestDerived2 is TestDerived {

}
```

Trying to compile any of the derived contracts, yields the error in 0.5.1. Adding the extra ABIEncoderV2 lines to all derived contracts makes it compile again.

I've had the exact same issue.

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract A {
    struct S {
        bool b;
    }
}

contract B is A {
    function test(S calldata s) external returns (bool);
//    function test2(S calldata s) external returns (bool);
}

contract C is B {
    function test(S calldata s) external returns (bool) {
        return s.b;
    }
}
```

This code suggests there's a bit more to this.  As written, the code generates the UnimplementedFeatureError.  However, if you uncomment the commented line, it compiles!  Something isn't right!

(tried on several 0.5.xx.xx versions)

@zakalwe if you uncomment `test2`, this will make `B` and `C` abstract and thus no code generation will be requested. The error will be visible again as soon as you implement `test2` in a derived contract.

This issue was discussed today, and we concluded that the 0.4.25 behavior was the faulty one. The derived contracts want to make use of the V2 encoder in function `giveMe`, so they should also declare `pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2`.

It should not be an "UnimplementedFeatureError" though.

I _think_ I'm seeing similar behaviour for a _slightly different_ issue. I'm using ````pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2````, which allows me to take advantage of passing structs in and out of functions.  Ideally, I'd like to do this:

```
struct SomeStruct {
    bool aVar;
    uint8 anotherVar;
    uint8 yetAnotherVar;
    uint8 andYetAnotherVar;
}

mapping(uint8 => bytes32[]) private refToSomeStruct;

function setActivity(uint8 _ref, SomeStruct calldata _param) external {
  refToSomeStruct[_ref] = _param
}
```

However, with the latest version of truffle, I get a rather unhelpful **UnimplementedFeatureError** (with no explanation. However, I note that only the latest release of Solidity, v0.5.4, implements the required ````struct calldata```` behaviour, but truffle is using v0.5.0.

Therefore, my request is twofold. First, is it possible to make **UnimplementedFeatureError** slightly more helpful (so it informs what feature is unimplemented)? Secondly, any chance Truffle could upgrade to v0.5.4?

@glowkeeper that is definitely a different issue. Could you create a new ticket for your issue and provide a test case that produces the UnimplementedFeatureError? (I tried your provided code and didn't get the error)

@Marenz - interesting - that was a contrived example, based on my actual code - just assumed, given the Solidity release docs regarding v0.5.4, that it was the `SomeStruct calldata _param` bit causing the problem - I'll do some more investigation and, if needs be, post accordingly.

Just as a further note, I have this at the top of my Solidity source files:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
```

Do you get the error if you add that?

@glowkeeper I am happy to discuss this more, but please in an dedicated issue for this :). I had the problem that I got compiler errors when assigning to the mapping as the struct wasn't castable to bytes32[].  I did use the experimental pragma.
