# [\#5664 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5664) `merged`: Use imported CMake targets.

This is the cleaner and recommended way for using CMake ``>= 3.0.0``.
~~We still need to require ``CMake >= 3.5.0`` to be able to use imported targets for Boost, but that's already available in Ubuntu/trusty, so it should be fine. There might be issues with CMake being older than the version of Boost we use - we should see that in CI.~~ (EDIT: I dropped using imported targets for Boost, since this indeed requires a CMake version that's newer than the respective boost version)

Ah well, yeah, I was afraid of that - it is indeed a problem to use Boost imported targets with CMake versions older than the Boost version - so for "proper" Boost 1.67 support we'd need to require CMake 3.12.0... which is probably newer than we want (at least for now), so I'll change Boost back to using "old-style" CMake. It's a pity, though :-).

Can this be safely merged for the release?

@chriseth I don't think this will cause any problem for the release, so it shouldn't be a problem to merge it before the release. But there's no hurry in this either, so if we want to be sure we might as well only merge it after.
