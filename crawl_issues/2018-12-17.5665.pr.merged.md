# [\#5665 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5665) `merged`: Add headers to targets in CMakeLists.txt.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-12-17 14:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5665):

IDE's will commonly expect headers to be in the CMake targets (it's necessary for include resolution when viewing the header) and it's generally better style to include them in their respective target (especially for headers without corresponding implementation that will otherwise be "stray" files in the repo not belonging to any target and for consistency better to just always do it).

@ekpyron I'm fine with it if this helps your workflow. I'm just a little concerned what happens if someone adds a new header file and forgets adding it to the list.
