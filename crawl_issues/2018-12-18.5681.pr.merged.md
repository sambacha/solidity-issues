To ease reviewing and following up changes, this should have been 3 PRs:
1) not emitting empty objects in StandardCompiler
2) safety assertions in CompilerStack
3) not running compile if it is not requested

I didn't fully review the safety assertions, but some of them seem to change semantics. They are done twice - once in the caller and once in `contracts()`, which could be removed. Also having a helper for the assertion may be beneficial at this stage to avoid that much code duplication.

OK merging this if there's no time to address these concerns. It seems to be ok.
