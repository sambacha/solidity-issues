@christianparpart sorry I forgot to assign this, but had the code ready (it is not many changes).

However, there is one question to be decided before going ahead with this: libraries, optimiser settings and "use literal sources in metadata" currently can be changed between analysis and compilation, but are included in the metadata.

Simple solution is to disallow calling any of these after the `AnalysisSuccessful` state.

Sounds good!

Elsewhere you mentioned you are not convinced this is the right direction. What are the downsides?

Suggestion from @chriseth: only allow changing these settings prior to parsing.
