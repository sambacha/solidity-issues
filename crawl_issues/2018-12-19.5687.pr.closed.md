# [\#5687 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5687) `closed`: DOCS: Docs split

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42080?u=54f700afa4263a5f86d2036b7ae598c2a2b419c0&v=4" width="50">[ChrisChinchilla](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla) opened issue at [2018-12-19 07:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5687):

This PR closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5396 and splits some longer docs into smaller files.

Reflects latest changes, although the diff of course is vastly different as there are new files. Probably easiest to checkout locally and test a build. I took a logical section approach to splitting, some are longer than others, and I left other files that are already not that long. It may be that we split more in the future, or split more now.

I am happy to communicate these changes to translators, active forks etc, and handle merging any pull requests that come in after these changes.

My tests now passing, not sure about AppVeyor.

Could you please split one file per commit? The first commit just adds files without removing somewhere, and thus this might make it hard to track changes.

OK @chriseth unpicking things and re-comitting got slightly messy, but I think this is it. I also re-added changes from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/af3e6db038c0ef2ce847537129e19deaec3c906a that came in after I last pushed here, which is the reason behind that conflict showing. In this case, it's hard to resolve it as things change so much.

The first commit still only contains additions.

What about creating one pull request per file to split?

@chriseth I tried removing those first commits and they kept coming back, will try again.

I had a feeling you might ask for seperate PRs for each change, that's going to need a lot of unpicking and generate a lot of PRs, but it's possible.

@chriseth After attempting to fix a lot of merge conflicts, I think I will just start these PRs again afresh.
