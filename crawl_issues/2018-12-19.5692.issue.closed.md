## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
In install_deps.sh, line 59 (sed -n -e 's/^NAME="\?\([^"]*\)"\?$/\1/p' /etc/os-release) will get CentOS Linux instead of CentOS, so it cant match CentOS.  
I suggest that in line 355ï¼Œ can modified     "           CentOS)" to "           CentOS*)"

## Environment
CentOS 7.2
- Compiler version:
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:
