make use of unique_ptr instead of shared_ptr within the scope of libyul

Fixes #5653.

The only reason for these to be pointers and not value-members is because they are optional, right? Is it nicer to make them ``boost::optional`` instead of ``std::unique_ptr`` then? (And later with C++17, of course, ``std::optional`` ;-)?) I'm not sure what I prefer myself actually, but might be worth considering!

Yes, some of them are optional, but in other cases, the main motivation was to not have a boost::variant as an in-place member (and also to keep the variant itself small).

So to summarize: The fewer indirections the better, but we should check that `sizeof()` does not get too large.

We could even consider to use ``optional``, whenever the intention is in fact for the member to be optional and ``std::unique_ptr``, if the reason is merely a smaller size for the struct or to avoid problems due to recursions :-).

It could be nice to have a checked unique_ptr, that asserts when `*` or `->` is invoked while it is null.

Actually, I'm not sure whether the size of these structs is in fact an issue - they will end up being non-copyable anyways, won't they? If they have to be copyable, we can't use ``unique_ptr`` anyways. So we probably only have to deal with recursions with variants (and I'm not sure we'll run into that problem)...
And yes: a "checked" unique_ptr might indeed be nice.

Size is not only relevant when copying, it is also relevant when just iterating over it. Of course, only a profiler will tell, because also locality is important.

I'm really not sure about this. I think we should only change it following a profiling run. The original issue was just to change from `shared_ptr` to `unique_ptr` to prevent modifications and nothing else.
