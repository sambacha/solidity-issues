# [\#5695 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5695) `closed`: Indexed reference types cannot be encoded in events with ABIEncoderV2

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-12-19 14:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5695):

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L525

Note that the old encoder also does not support "indexed" together with *some* reference types.

The specification says the topic of indexed reference types has to be the "Keccak hash of the packed encoded value (see Strict Encoding Mode), rather than the encoded value directly.". 

This means that if we want to fully solve this issue, we need #4821
