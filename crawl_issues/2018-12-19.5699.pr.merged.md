sorry for the rather quick'n'tiny one. I just noticed along the lines and wanted to give it a PR. ;-)

cmake: Do not depend on a C compiler to be present by explicitly stating that this is a C++ project.

CMake defaults to C *and* C++ toolchain, in case nothing has been specified.
This means that cmake always checks for both, which is more than needed.

This PR cuts off C toolchain requirement from /CMakeLists.txt and ensures that we
don't pass along any `..._C_...` variables in EthCompilerSettings.cake nor jsoncpp.cmake.
