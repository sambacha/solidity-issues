#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34049754?u=131c23586c178f83961f57b98f30b15cc9fa108e&v=4" width="50">[HaoXuan40404](https://github.com/HaoXuan40404) opened issue at [2019-01-03 02:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5733):

In install_deps.sh, line 59 (sed -n -e 's/^NAME="?([^"])"?$/\1/p' /etc/os-release) will get CentOS Linux instead of CentOS, so it cant match CentOS.
I suggest that in line 355ï¼Œ can modified " CentOS)" to " CentOS*)"

Closes #5692.
