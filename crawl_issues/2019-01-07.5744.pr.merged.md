At a quick glance the test failure looks "wrong" - weird...

Maybe https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/1668?

Locally the warning might not be treated as an error - but it may be the problem in the issue I linked, i.e. sphinx reading the included file as a "standalone" file as well - so we may want to exclude them in the sphinx config. I haven't looked into our sphinx config, though, so I may be wrong.

So it should be enough to rename all files to-be-included to ``*.inc`` instead of ``*.rst``, so that sphinx ignores them (apart from the include itself).

@ekpyron I'd like to avoid using .inc for a variety of reasons, but I'm going to see if I can find another solution, and use this as plan b.
