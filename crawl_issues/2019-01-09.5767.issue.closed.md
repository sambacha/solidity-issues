From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5757

Extend the compilation tests in [isolate_tests.py](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/isolate_tests.py) to cover [README.md](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/README.md) -- this will check if it can be compiled with the current version.

Yes, it's up for the taking, though it's very low priority to be honest. Unless you just specifically want a Python task (the only changes here will be in a Python script), I'd recommend first looking at the issues I recently listed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12332#issuecomment-1310522329 instead.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
