# [\#5773 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5773) `closed`: [Yul] Expression simplifier not working in specific case

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-01-09 14:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5773):

Why isn't `add(headStart44, value4)` simplified to `value4`?
Especially since we already use the fact that `value4` is zero in the revert call above...
