# [\#5776 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5776) `merged`: [Yul] Equivalent function combiner.

Implements #5291 - although detection could still be extended using data flow analysis as suggested in the issue.

Maybe needs some more tests?

I'm not entirely happy with this yet - it looks nice as it is, but it's somewhat unsafe:

``SyntacticallyEqual`` overloads call operators for ``Expression`` and ``Statement``, which are both variants. Since the element types of the variants are implicitly convertible to the variants themselves, the safety features of ``boost::apply_visitor`` fail: in case an overload is missing, instead of erroring out, the ``variant`` overload is called recursively, which will end in an infinite loop.

Unfortunately preventing that will make it necessary to split things up and duplicate code (e.g. if I split into ``expressionEqual`` and ``statementEqual```the vector and shared_ptr overloads need to be duplicated).

Attention: there seem to be some differences in compiler support of the C++14 features: there was a travis test failure in an intermediate version - so this should not be merged before the travis tests succeed.
Also: should be squashed before merging.

Potential extension: If the expressions of assignments and variable declarations are found to be movable, they could first be ignored in the comparison and instead just set a flag for the variable, indicating that on the next reference it's value has to be checked using data flow analysis.

Actually, this could be simplified quite a bit, once #5778 is solved. If ``variant`` overloads did not collide with overloads for their alternatives, we wouldn't have to split into ``operator()``, ``expressionEqual`` and ``statementEqual``, but could just use ``operator()`` everywhere (before #5778 is addressed this would be very dangerous). This, then, would allow for simplifying the ``vector`` and ``shared_ptr`` helpers.

EDIT: probably better to keep it as is anyways.

Looks good! I think we want to wait for the other PR to be merged first.

Do we keep it at the somewhat sparse level of testing? Testing ``SyntacticallyEqual`` for all or at least a worthwhile part of possible inequalities would probably be exponential...

It might make sense to write an automated and / or randomized test that modifies code and checks that the modified code is not equal.

That'd be pretty cool, yes...
