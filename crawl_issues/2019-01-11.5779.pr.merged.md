Is #2157 the right issue?

Please note that comments are invalid in JSON so the file is still invalid. `"` are needed in JSON, the old version only "kind of" worked in Javascript.

@axic The comment in #2157 triggered this - it complained about ``file://`` being suggested in the example, but (as long as #2157 itself is not fixed) this won't work, so it should be removed from the example.

I haven't checked further what needs to change for Javascript and I'm not sure how to deal with the comments - it seems for the command line some comments are allowed, others are not (in particular comments between commas and array members seem to be invalid, others seem to be allowed).

@chriseth suggested that the example should "work", but now I'm not sure what would qualify as "it works" (there are references to files and incomplete hashes, etc., in it after all) and/or whether that's feasible (given that we definitely want the comments in there)...
