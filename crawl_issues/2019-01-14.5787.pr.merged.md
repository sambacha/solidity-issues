This PR is to make sure we use at least Boost 1.65 on CircleCI and 1.67 @ AppVeyor. - before it was 1.62 and 1.61.

**Motivation:** boost 1.65 is the first to also provide `boost::get` for rvalue-references.

For AppVeyor, I've directly upgraded to Boost 1.67 (I already had it prebuilt and just needed to package & upload).

@ekpyron you're not entirely wrong. But i believe there is no process for that (yet). Even the prior releases haven't been really created "automatically" by the CI (as it should, as of reading the build/CI scripts - it's "temporarily disabled" - since years). So we leave it as is for now, and at _some_ point in the future, we should globally overhaul and streamline the whole CI process :-)
