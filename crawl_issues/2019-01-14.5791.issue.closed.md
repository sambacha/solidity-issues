# [\#5791 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5791) `closed`: Optimisation step: consecutive jumpdest pruner
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

#4959 mentioned a potential new optimisation step:

> P2 ‚Äî {M consecutive jumpdests} ‚Üí {jumpdest}, M ‚â• 2
> jumpdest marks a valid jump target (i.e., any valid jump operation must jump to a jumpdest). M consecutive jumpdests can be replaced with one because they point to the same operation (i.e., the operation after the final jumpdest). The deployment and invocation of this anti-pattern waste 68 √ó (ùëÄ ‚àí 1) units and (ùëÄ ‚àí 1) units of gas (the execution of a jumpdest needs 1 unit of gas), respectively.

While libevmasm has a step to remove unreferenced `JUMPDEST`s there doesn't seem to be a way to change referenced ones.

A good new step could:
1) search for consecutive `JUMPDEST`s
2) change all the references to the first one

After this step the `UnusedJumpdests` step could prune the ones left.

This might already be implemented through the block deduplicator.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
