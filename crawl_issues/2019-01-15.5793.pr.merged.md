Fixes #5792.
References #2324.

Came up during #5776 and will allow to more reasonably sort switch cases for the syntactic equality comparison there.

EDIT: I'm not sure whether it was a deliberate design decision **not** to require matching types in switch cases so far.
EDIT: Also this is two things at once - let me know if I should split.

Damn - emscripten seems to require all ``.cpp`` files to be have distinct names, even if they are in different paths... strange thing to require IMO... Still, to work around renaming ``optimizer/Utilities.cpp`` to ``optimizer/OptimizerUtilities.cpp`` is probably best (I think it still makes sense to split into optimizer specific and general "Utilities")...

EDIT: renamed

Thinking about it: this might have warranted a changelog entry.

This should go into the changelog.

Update: ah just seen you commented that :)
