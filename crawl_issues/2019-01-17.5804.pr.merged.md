### Description

Hello,

This PR (CC #5212 ):
  - adds a libfuzzer fuzzer test harness for Solidity
  - shares code with the existing afl harness
  - adds a `README.md` in the newly created `test/tools/ossfuzz` directory

The libfuzzer harness is to be built in the Dockerized environment provided by oss-fuzz. Once this PR is correctly merged, the plan is to issue another PR to upstream google oss-fuzz repo to start fuzzing solidity continuously.

Sorry about that.

Looks good to me. Great improvement :) I was wondering if we should mention this in the documentation as well?

Will do. Do we all agree that the right place for `contains` that will now be called `findAnyOf` is `libdevcore/CommonData.h`? Looking at the rest of `CommonData.h`, `findAnyOf` blends in well I am inclined to think.
