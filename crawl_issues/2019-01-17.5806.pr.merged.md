# [\#5806 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5806) `merged`: Disallow calldata structs.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-01-17 12:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5806):

Fixes #5479.

I guess we have a separate issue for actually specifying and implementing calldata structs?

~~I also added ``isInterface``, since we had ``isLibrary`` already.~~(merged separately)

~~EDIT: non-extracted contracts still need to be adjusted.~~(done)

I'm wondering whether this could be easier to implement in `canBeUsedExternally` - but then we won't get a nice error message.

I'll check how much effort it is to catch all cases in the type checker outside ``canBeUsedExternally``. If it's not too bad (which I think, it won't be), then I'd prefer it there - otherwise it'll seem like it's conceptually wrong and not just as-of-yet-unsupported.
