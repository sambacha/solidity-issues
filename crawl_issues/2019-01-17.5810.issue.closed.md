# [\#5810 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5810) `closed`: Optimizer rule that removes masking before shift

This should go into the rule list (`libevmasm/RuleList.h`).

During encoding and decoding, we might do things like
`(x && 0xff) << (256-8)` or similar with right shifts.

The masking is redundant here.

We should add optimizer rules that remove the masking in this case. A similar rule could be added for signextend plus shift.

Furthermore, there should be rules for both shift and multiplication with a power of two.

This can easily be implemented in the RuleList if targeting Constantinople because `SHL` exists as an opcode. Should be also possible to have a rule with `MUL`.

@chriseth can you clarify the proposed rule? 

`(x && 0xff) << (256-8)` seems to shift the bottom 8 bits to the top. No masking should be needed here.

When you mean "and similar for shr" do you mean something like: `(x && 0xff0000..000) >> (256 - 8)` ?

Yes, the masking is redundant, and because of that `(x && 0xff) << (256-8)` should be replaced by `x << (256-8)`.

The masks before left shift can of course be extended to the left while the masks before right shift can be extended to the right.

So basically, perhaps as a simplification:

`(A && B) << C` -> `(A << C) && (B << C)` and if `B` and `C` are constants, it should solve itself.

EDIT: Ah, that's actually not the full rule, the shift in `B << C` is actually allowed to shift in ones or zeros, whatever is better.

This might benefit from bit mask tracking.

Does #6160 close this issue? This is flagged as "needs review" in the 0.5.8 project.

Neither this nor #6160 will be included in the 0.5.8 release.

Also should consider removing masking after shift (e.g. (uint256 >> 248) && 0xff)

This really reminds me of the decompiler project that just has a combined "mask and shift" concept.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
