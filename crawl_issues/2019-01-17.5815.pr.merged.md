# [\#5815 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5815) `merged`: Strict abi decoder (validate incoming data instead of cleaning it)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2019-01-17 23:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5815):

Fixes #5844.

This shows the changes discussed in #3303. We can discuss it here and close this PR if it turns out to be a bad direction.

Todo:
- [x] merge bool change from #3303 
- [x] add validation case for integer type
- [x] update tests

It fixes the following currently:
- enums do not generate a revert function on encoding
- ~~decoding address/contract will not generate code with "invalid()" if revert was requested (this can easily be pulled into a separate PR)~~ [moved to #5843]
- decoding dirty FixedBytes generates a revert/abort

I think all the validations are implemented, still need to update tests (and some new ones).

@chriseth would welcome some initial review on the logic part (tests are not updated yet!)

We could do the same in `CompilerUtils::convertType` when `_asPartOfArgumentDecoding` is true.

This should now keep in mind the comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5936#discussion_r254655566 - we will probably want a version of ``CompilerUtils::loadFromMemoryDynamic`` that validates instead of cleaning - that in turn calls ``CompilerUtils::convertType`` with ``_asPartOfArgumentDecoding = true`` - so we might want to validate and not clean there in that case... Or we need to change away from ``loadFromMemoryDynamic`` for the calldata struct member access after all, whichever works better, but we have to keep this in mind.

> Unless we are talking about an enum, validation can always be implemented as

That's mostly true, except the integer case (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5815#discussion_r254235569). It definitely simplifies the C++ source code, not sure of the generated EVM code is worse or better. Or if the current version generates slightly better EVM output justifies the complexity.

If the code is suboptimal, we should work on the optimizer. Readability and verifyability should be the top goal.

I'll squash some of the commits.

Actually I'll remove the return value altogether.

The unoptimized ABIv2 gas tests need to be adjusted, though.

Ah, one more thing: at least the ``calldata_struct_cleaning`` in ``SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`` test needs to be adjusted to expect validation instead of cleaning.

Actually that's rather reassuring - I was actually surprised that it looked like only one before.

Since a lot of the current tests will now test validation instead of cleanup we need to add back new cleanup tests for the abi encoder.
