Tested with solc-js 0.5.0, all tests are green apart from the version test (as expected).

Wait a second. How did Zeppelin tests finish *before this PR* if they use truffle and an old solc-js?

Because we patch solc to use solc master: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/externalTests.sh#L64

If we are serious about #5830 then we should always patch it to 0.5.0.

I think this was needed while we were preparing for 0.5.0, we might want to revert the other patch now - or run with both versions.

Anyway, is this PR here good to go?

I'd prefer if this could change the Zeppelin test to use solc-js 0.5.0 so that we can confirmation it works and sets the stage for future changes adhering to this rule.

I'll merge this now so that we get a nightly build with it and create a new PR that also changes zeppelin.
