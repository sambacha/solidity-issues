Are we tracking smt features in the changelog?

Well this one doesn't even seem to be exposed to language features,

We are, but this is just an internal change to enable the usage in the SMTChecker which will be in the Changelog.

It looks like the `z3` version used in the tests doesn't have `mod`. Trying to figure what version introduced it. My local 4.8.0 has it.

Z3 added `mod` in version 4.6.0.
Ubuntu Cosmic uses Z3 4.4, therefore this won't work in the tests.

I asked Z3 directly and they are not maintaining it nor will.
I asked directly in the ubuntu package page if there are update plans (https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/z3/+question/677999).

What happens if I try to compile this with an older version of z3?

It will fail to compile saying `z3::mod` doesn't exist.

Is it possible to add a CMAKE check to force a certain version?
My aim is to have a message that tells users which version to install.

Ok will try that.

@leonardoalt didn't you say no Ubuntu version has an appropriate z3? Hence releases cannot be made with z3 anymore? (Or they aren't?)

If we do make releases with z3 I'd opt to have an ifdef and warning at runtime if using that feature. If we do not care about z3 support in releases, I'm more than happy to merge as is, given the cmake-time version check.

@axic After https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5897 was merged I take it that releases will not have z3 anymore. I agree with your second option.

Hm - in that case, is it really not possible to have a workaround, i.e. to define mod manually?

I'm not sure that'd be a good workaround. One workaround would be to not use `mod` at all, but if we do I'd stick to the correct operator.

Since I removed the `QUIET` option, CMake will inform whatever happens to finding Z3. I can also keep `QUIET` and use an if instead of `VERSION_VAR` to report that the version is wrong.
