Fixed, but are we happy with the naming?

Perhaps something like `relaseBuffer` / `freeBuffer`?

By the way, did you check this actually has an effect in emscripten?

Solc-js copies the result from `compile`, so calling this wouldn't have an adverse effect. Haven't checked if emscripten gets any actual benefit from this - it definitely shouldn't break anything. My motivation for this is other use cases where it is statically linked, such as Rust, but it should also help when compiling libsolc to webassembly.

I was thinking along the lines this function would "reset" the state, should we have more state in the future. If de not except anything like that then release/free might be better.

`cleanup` is something I would expect to call at the very end, right before shutdown, so either `releaseBuffers` or `reset` would be better in my opinion.

I would have assumed the standard-json interface to carry no state.

I would hope we wouldn't introduce any state into this API.

@christianparpart @ekpyron @bit-shift @leonardoalt what do you think, what would be a good naming for this function?

I like `free`, especially because it's a C API ;)

I like `solidity_free` since `malloc`/`free` is a familiar C idiom for memory (de)allocation :)

Renamed to free, though I'm not satisfied with any of the namings :)

Rebased after some other PR changed fuzzer common. Will merge once tests pass.
