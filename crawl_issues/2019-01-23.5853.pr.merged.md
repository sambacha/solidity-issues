I thought the opposite..
The thing is that if we warn first, we don't know whether there are unhandled queries, that is, we might be warning in the second run unnecessarily

Sure, we should not warn needlessly, but it would be better if this warning could be before any other smt warning. If that's too complicated then this is of course fine.

Actually - doing non-cleanup stuff in the destructor sounds a little unsafe to me. Could you do it in `analyze()`? This function may be called multiple times, but we only have one instance of SMTChecker per compilation run, so we can use a flag to denote whether we already added the warning or not.

@chriseth @axic Updated.
I added a local ErrorList in the SMTChecker, didn't have to change a lot in ErrorReporter.
The current code doesn't show any other SMTChecker warning if the "No SMT solver available" warning is there. I find that cleaner. Let me know if you think the other warnings should be there anyway, even though there was no SMT run.

Added a function to know how many solvers are available to only warn when Z3 and CVC4 are not, and still show the unhandled queries generated by SmtLib2Interface when they are.
