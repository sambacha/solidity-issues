Ah and also: Just like with the disambiguator, there should be an option to have a list of identifiers that are not changed at all.

Perhaps it could be an option to subclass Disambiguator or ASTCopier and only implement the `translateIdentifier` class?

I actually thought about it, but `Disambiguator` is creating a new copy of the AST, something I didn't want to do. I am thinking about it.

You are right, probably not worth it.

Please add a dedicated test in `test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/varNameCleaner/` that shows that the suffix counters in two functions are independent, i.e.
```
{
function f() { let x_1 := 0 }
function g() { let x_2 := 0 }
}
```
is turned to
```
{
function f() { let x := 0 }
function g() { let x := 0 }
}
```

There was an error when running `test_check_style` for commit `4483b255befafcf12a7889e9a4bf7cc947dc6995`:
```
Error: Trailing whitespace found:

Please check that your changes are working as intended.

Concerning the function names: I just saw that while looking through existing code: It should be sufficient to collect function names while traversing the AST and in the following way: Whenever you start visiting a Block, iterate through all statements. If the statement is a function definition, add the function name to the blacklist.

I think this should be sufficient for now. We also do not need to remove functions when they go out of scope as they _should_ be globally unique anyway at the end of the optimizer run.

@chriseth Updated. Change `boost::optional<YulString>` to `YulString` since I need to always check anyway if the variable name is ok because of return variables.
