### Description
This PR adds a parser (part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4223) that will be used in our file-based unit test environment (esp. for semantic tests ran by `isoltest`: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5872). It can parse function call definitions and expected results produced when those are executed later on:
```
contract test {
    uint public balance;
    function f(uint a, uint b) public returns(uint d) { return a ** 0; }
    function vote() public { require(msg.value >= balance, "Not enough ether."); }
}
// ----
// f(uint256): 1 -> 1 # Takes one parameter and is expected to return one value. #
// f(uint256, uint8): 
// 1,
// 2
// -> 1
// i_am_not_there() 
// # This function is not available and the transaction will revert. #
// -> FAILURE
// vote(), 314 ether -> # Sending ether is also supported. #
```

### Core ideas

#### Scanner
- The parser relies on a scanner and pulls through the character stream
- Tokens are defined by `SoltToken` (meaning `sol_t` or `SOLT` which stands for "Solidity Test (Language)")
- Scanned tokens: `(`, `)`, `:`, `->`, `,`, `#`, `[`, `]` , `identifiers`, type keyword: `ether`, special keyword `FAILURE`
- Parser takes tokens and creates objects that are picked up by the semantic tests (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5872): `FunctionCall`, `FunctionCallArgs` and `FunctionCallExpectations`.

#### Single-line / multi-line mode
- single / multi-line mode will be detected as follows: every newline (`//`) in source results in a function call that has its display mode set to multi-mode. Function parameter and result value (or expectation parameter) lists are an exception: a single parameter stores a format information that contains a newline definition.
- The mode is used for formatting the commandline output as well as the updated expectations printed to the test fix
- This solution has the downside, that any special formatting will be lost if updated at some point by isoltest. 

#### Formatting information for semantic tests https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5872: 
- While a test is parsed and its parameters / expectation objects are created, the formats defined by the used literals are retained
- When a function call object is printed, the given formats are applied. If values do not fit the given format, some fallback formats depending on the type are applied
- Since function call parameters can contain newlines `//`, these are also retained, such that they can be printed correctly afterwards. 
- Formats also contain an `ABIType`, which can be `Signed`, `Unsigned`, `Failure` and `None` for now. These are the types that are used to encode the actual number literals and the special type `Failure`. `None` is used to encode no parameters and no return values, resulting in an empty `bytes`. `Failure` results in an empty `bytes` as well, but has different semantics and needs to be handled accordingly.

### Further development ideas
- create a parser with `boost::spirit` that does not change the current interface

What is the syntax for sending ether and arguments?

If it is split like this, I suggest:
> // f(uint256):
> // <- 1
> // -> 1

I previously proposed to split the function arguments. What I meant was that it is possible to add newlines whenever space is allowed and that a line that starts with `->` marks the transition between arguments and return values.

Example:

```
f(uint, uint, uint, uint): 4, 5,
6,
7
-> 9
```

@axic Oh, the syntax is even wrong. Sorry about that. It would be (note the colon):
```
// vote(uint256, uint256): 1,1 [0.314]
// -> 1
```
or following what @chriseth proposed:
```
// vote(uint256, uint256): [0.314]
// 1, 1
// -> 1
```
I fear that this might become hard to read. What do you think about making the ether value a "second optional parameter" like below. Something, that I also considered is the potential support of arrays and the current usage of `[` and `]` for declaring the value.
```
// vote(uint256, uint256, uint256[]):
// 1, 1, [1..2]
// : 0.314
// -> 1
```

Updated. It now parses the following syntax:
```
 * // f(uint256, uint256): 1, 1 # Signature and comma-separated list of arguments
 * // : 0                       # (Optional) Ether value to be send with the call
 * // -> 1, 1                   # Expected result value
```
I'd like to get some feedback on the ether value. This was my first shot to separate it from the other arguments. Here, I'd now vote for taking @chriseth proposal: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5860#issuecomment-457234316

@bit-shift what is the current design? Is the description on the top updated and reflecting what is being implemented?

Ah damn... looking through #5872 I just realized:
Actually we *don't* want or need to store the type information of the function arguments at all - instead we should just store the whole original, unparsed string of the function call right up to the ``->``... In #5872 we don't ever need nor want to reformat anything before the expected result - we can and should just re-emit the original, unparsed string up to the arrow when printing updated expectations... Only the result of the call should ever change when updating, but the way #5872 works now, the formatting of the arguments will change all the time as well, which will be annoying... But fortunately it will be easy to just store the original string encoding as well during scanning and I think it'll be fine to deal with all that in #5872, even though it actually belongs here.
