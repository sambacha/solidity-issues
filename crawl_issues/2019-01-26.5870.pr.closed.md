# [\#5870 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5870) `closed`: Ensuring UTF-8 encoding for MSVC builds

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3807885?u=4cc661c416990159548dd05e1340771865d01edd&v=4" width="50">[shellygr](https://github.com/shellygr) opened issue at [2019-01-26 10:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5870):

Support for different locales in WIN compilation by setting /utf-8 flag in MSVC.

Build may otherwise fail with errors such as:
`solidity\test\libdevcore\utf8.cpp : warning C4819: The file contains a character that cannot be represented in the current code page (1255). Save the file in Unicode format to prevent data loss`

@shellygr thanks, can you squash the commits into one?

What MSVC versions did required this flag?

Since it's a one line change I'll close this pull request and open another one. 
Re. your question - it's VS2017. Not sure this option existed before that.

If you create PRs from branches it is usually easier to squash/rebase/.. work with them.
