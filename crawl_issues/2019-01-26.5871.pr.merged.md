> Re. your question - it's VS2017. Not sure this option existed before that.

Does that mean it will fail on earlier compilers? We do compile with VS2015, but automation is of Appveyor is not turned on for fork PRs.

Isn't VS2017 a prerequisite according to the Solidity install guide?
In any case it should be fine though -
According to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/utf-8-set-source-and-executable-character-sets-to-utf-8?view=vs-2015
this option did exist in VS2015.

Sorry, you are correct, support was dropped in 0.5.2 (#5669).
