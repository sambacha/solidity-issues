Can you explain why this is needed? I could see arguments for both versions.

It is not about need, but they accomplish two very different things and wasn't sure what should be there by design.

Also while investigating one of the reports it looked weird why would it start on different states, only I've figured out this code does it. If this is the desired behaviour, a comment should be placed mentioning it.
