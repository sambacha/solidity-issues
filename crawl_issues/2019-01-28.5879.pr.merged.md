### Description

This PR removes the the FAQ item about returning values from web3.js as I think we discussed in the past that we'd generally remove items too specific to non-Solidity projects.

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1219

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
