# [\#5881 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5881) `merged`: [DOCS] Remove initialisation of contract with wei FAQ item

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42080?u=54f700afa4263a5f86d2036b7ae598c2a2b419c0&v=4" width="50">[ChrisChinchilla](https://github.com/ChrisChinchilla) opened issue at [2019-01-28 13:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5881):

### Description

I feel like this FAQ item is covered in _control-structures.rst_ line 73, but the example doesn't mention the `new` syntax, so maybe I am wrong, in which case I'll add this into that section.

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1219

I think it's fine to remove that FAQ item since it's covered in the paragraph you mentioned and also in the next section: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/control-structures.html#creating-contracts-via-new.

But: this PR needs to be rebased ;)

@bit-shift and @chriseth I think we delete it, I'll create a new PR asap.
