# [\#5883 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5883) `merged`: Do not provide access to external assembly variables from within functions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-01-28 13:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5883):

This function is used within the compiler to inject yul snippets. The `_localVariables` provide access to the content of the stack as it is before the inline assembly snippet and thus this is not available from within yul functions.
