@chriseth I might be wrong and there was as specific reason to do it the old way?

> Looks good! Did you check if this is actually covered by tests or what effects on gas it has for real code?

No, I still don't have working testeth on my computer. The non-EndToEnd tests didn't show any failure (= we do not have tests there for this).

Can you at least try to compile some contracts and see the difference for `--gas` or `--asm`?

Will do that.

@chriseth added a test case, please check

@chriseth this is ready for review - will squash after.

Split up the function. I think this is the only reasonable way to support it (otherwise the code may be more complext), but not sure it is worth it.

Closing since this seems rather tricky and it is not known whether it is actually very useful.

Tests should be included in develop, though.

Salvaged the test into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7014
