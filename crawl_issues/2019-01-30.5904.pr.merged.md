# [\#5904 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5904) `merged`: Add fuzzer config files for oss-fuzz and a solidity fuzzing dictionary

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-01-30 11:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5904):

### Description

(Incorporates feedback and closes #5863)

Credit goes to @jonathanmetzman for creating the initial fuzzing dictionary that was augmented by a few more tokens sourced from `solidity.readthedocs.io.`

This PR adds a couple of configuration files that are to be used by oss-fuzz and a fuzzing dictionary for solidity
  - `test/tools/ossfuzz/config/solc_opt_ossfuzz.options`
  - `test/tools/ossfuzz/config/solc_noopt_ossfuzz.options`
  - `test/tools/ossfuzz/config/solidity.dict`

The configuration files instruct the fuzzing engines behind oss-fuzz to use the dictionary towards fuzz testing. The string tokens in the said dictionary will be used towards input mutations in addition to other mutation algorithms.

The hope is that by crafting a careful list of solidity-specific tokens, we create more meaningful solidity input that (hopefully) trigger deeper bugs in the Solidity compiler.

> Could also add `assembly {`

Thank you, I was wondering if we need a separate assembly dictionary for an upcoming YUL/assembly fuzzer (#5900 ) sourced from here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/assembly.html?

assembly is part of Solidity, so I think we should also fuzz it as part of Solidity. The yul fuzzer will be more targeted, I would assume the Solidity fuzzer to more probe the interface between solidity and inline assembly.

okay. In that case, should I add additional "assembly" specific tokens from here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/assembly.html#opcodes?

@bshastry perhaps add some things like `let x := `, `:=` and `add(` - I would say that should be sufficient for now
