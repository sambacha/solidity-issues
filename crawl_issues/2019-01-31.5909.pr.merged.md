# [\#5909 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5909) `merged`: Use specific boost include in DocStringParser

Part of #5913.

This is needed for C++17 support (at least on certain Boost and OS combinations)

I have boost 1.66 and `range/algorithm.h` includes `range/algoritm/random_shuffle.h` which relies on https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/random_shuffle - a removed `std` feature in C++17.

Boost changelog claims even 1.66 is C++17 compat though.

The travis issue is unrelated.
