Currently this fails because it finds issues. We could:
1) close this PR
2) ignore the failures, but merge it - with the hope that we'll fix them soon and not ignore the failures anymore
3) keep this open until they are fixed

Even though in Github it is not considered a failure in terms of CI, yet the red mark is next to the PR so because of that it would be deterimental :(

Suggest to merge this, but commenting out trigger to run it.

@axic ok! By the way, the memory leak seems to be connected to recursive structs, i.e. legal ones using mappings.

This should always create an ASAN build, but only run the tests on the develop branch, not on pull requests.
