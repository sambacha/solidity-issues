@ChrisChinchilla Thank you. I just started translating. I'm also going to ask the Japanese community to help this project to make the translation better.

@akira-19 Great! So I can help you more and connect you to other Solidity translators, can you email me your email address? Or you can also ping me on https://gitter.im/ethereum/documentation

@ChrisChinchilla Hi, I found a couple of people who are going to help the translation. So can you add @NoCtrlZ and @taizo-kato as contributors? And I think they might want to join gitter documentation room.

@akira-19 Excellent! I'll add them here, but for creating the translation, you create a fork of this repo, so you can add whoever you like to that. When you have that fork, let me know üëç.

@ChrisChinchilla We completed the translation. Can I create pull request to develop branch? We made a directory "docs_jp" on the same level as "docs". Would it be ok with that?

@axira-19 that's wonderful! How up-to-date is the translation? My main concerns about not merging right away are about versions: The version number in the japanese translation should reflect the actual state of the translation and not of the develop branch. Because of that, you would at least need to modify the part of `conf.py` that auto-discovers the version and maybe we should find a more sustainable solution to that problem.

@ChrisChinchilla We translated based on version 0.5.4. which I forked. During the translation, we didn't merge the "official" documentation. So literally, the Japanese translation is version 0.5.4.

It's hard to catch up with the latest version because the update is pretty fast. 
This is the very first Japanese translation and I think we made some mistakes (we tried not to make them though), so we might still need some modifications.

In my opinion, we can publish this and we will modify some mistakes after a while (I think users will point out some mistakes). Then, when version 0.6.0 is published, I can translate breaking changes if I'm available.

What do you say?

@akira-19 that sounds good! Maybe the best approach forward now is to link to the japanese version from the main page of the solidity docs. Once it is up to date, we can include it inside the repository.

@ChrisChinchilla You mean I publish them and you add the link, and you add them into the repository when we finish the modifications?
