@chriseth I may look for a good external link as otherwise the section could become quite long. I asked around about the "high s malleability problem" and no one knew for sure if it existed or not, so wasn't sure what to put really :/

Try these changes @chriseth and @bshastry cryptography is not a subject I know too well, so bear with me. I think the confusion comes from that many don't use the function directly in Solidity, but in in 3rd party libraries, so it may be best to add usage links to common libraries perhaps?

Thanks @bit-shift I think that was a squash issue, fixed now.
