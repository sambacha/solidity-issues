# [\#5934 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5934) `closed`: Refactor the way we use sanitizer within EthCompilerSettings.cmake
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-02-05 16:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5934):

At the moment, we relay the argument of `-DSANITIZE` to 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake#L141 

This may be a problem in two cases: (1) we want to add additional compiler flags per sanitizer; (2) if we want to the cmake extensible for adding more error detectors (e.g., undefined sanitizer) later on.

```
if (SANITIZE)
	set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=${SANITIZE}")
endif()
```

For example, if `SANITIZER=address` we may want to add additional flags for debugging. And if `SANITIZER=undefined` we may want to use several undefined flags such as those listed here: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/infra/base-images/base-builder/Dockerfile#L22
