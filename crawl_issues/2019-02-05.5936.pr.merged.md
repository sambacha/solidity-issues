Are calldata size checks properly enforced here? I think you already answered that question when I meant something else ;)

@chriseth Actually I thought they were, but now I'm not sure anymore, I'll recheck and make sure!

If we limit the scope of this PR to statically encoded structs, the only things left to do in my opinion are:
 1) try to get uint member access a bit more efficient.
 2) ssert that member access for non-value types is either a struct or an array.

Looks good, please squash!

Still needs more tests, I think.

Hm, perhaps a struct containing an external function pointer - those are always a little nasty.

Also ``abi.decode`` lacks tests (for calldata structs) so far, resp. doesn't support calldata structs, but should.

Added another test case for function pointers. I think it makes more sense to keep ``abi.decode`` as is for now (i.e. always copy to memory) and change it, when we also have calldata arrays, internal calladata calls and local calldata variables.

~~Do not merge yet - I may have missed one case in the TypeChecker - just verifying.~~ Nevermind, should be fine.
