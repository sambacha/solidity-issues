# [\#5941 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5941) `merged`: Metadata should not require compilation

Closes #5682. Depends on #6139.

Please comment on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5682#issuecomment-460856179. We need to answer these questions. I'm not convinced it is the right direction.

> This at least requires a change in StandardCompiler.cpp:204

it actually isn't a problem in standardcompiler - in there parse/compile is called after all the settings.

@chriseth @axic I've done the requested change. Too sad I did the same in my branch. But this one here looked more compled. Thx @axic for your aftershow-inspirations though. :-)

Still needs a change in `isBinaryRequested` in StandardCompiler.cpp.

Fixed, but that means we should definitely add a test.

Yep, I agree. There should already be similar tests, if I remember correctly.

Should be ready.

The reason bytecodecomparison fails on travis is that it uses the 0.5.4 release and not the soljson from the PR:
```
solcVersion: 0.5.4+commit.9549d8ff.Emscripten.clang
packageVersion: 0.5.4
Version matching
```

Rebased after #5959.

@chriseth maybe if you want to check this, for some reason in those bytecodecomparison tests the contract is not compiled anymore (bytecode is not returned), despite bytecode is requested.

It tries to compile a contract that has unimplemented features.

Due to the changes in this PR, it can still generated valid metadata. The script though assumes that there is only an error if the 'contract' key is missing.

Will fix.

I've seen that. But previously it didn't fail somehow when the metadata was requested?

Ah, right. All these scripts...
