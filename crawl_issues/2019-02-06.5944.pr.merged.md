# [\#5944 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5944) `merged`: Modify language assertion in AssemblyStack::optimize

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-02-06 13:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5944):

### Description

Currently, `AssemblyStack::optimize()` is targeted at `StrictAssembly` only. It was found that one YUL input was somehow successfully parsed, and only at the time of optimization it was found that the following assertion inside `libyul/AsmAnalysis.cpp` would fail

```
        solAssert(m_dialect->flavour != AsmFlavour::Yul, "");
```

The fix in this PR ensures that such failures are caught much earlier inside the call to `AssemblyStack::optimize()`

In addition to modifying the assertion, cmdline test `--yul --optimize` is disabled. This is because the patch rightly fails this test.

> This still needs a change in CommandlineInterface to disable the combination of `--yul` and `--optimize`. It should be a simple change around line 839. Please also add a check that these options now fail (similar to the check in cmdlineTests.sh line 334

Done.
