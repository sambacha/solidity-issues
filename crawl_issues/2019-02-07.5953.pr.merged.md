# [\#5953 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5953) `merged`: Remove type check that is covered by assertions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-02-07 11:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5953):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5839#discussion_r254583550

This is fine because there is an assertion further up that verifies it is a value type and even inside the if body, there is an assertion that it is exactly uint256.
