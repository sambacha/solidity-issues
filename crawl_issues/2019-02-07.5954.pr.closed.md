This is mostly to test gas performance.

Bad news, the new ABI coder, even with activated optimizations needs more gas than the old one. That's not too surprising due to the range checks, but still. Will investigate some more.

Hm, this is weird, it looks like the old optimizer does not run for output generated from the new optimizer. At least there are many snippets of `0x00 dup1 0x00 dup1 0x00 dup1` or

A long string seems to be encoded without codecopy.

Ah wait a second - the code is actually shorter and the constructor is cheaper at the same time!

And the gas estimator can estimate gas in more cases!

Ok, further investigation revealed that the strings are revert error messages. The old coder produced individual encoders for each revert call, while the new one combines them into a single function. Because of that, the strings are in the code multiple times and thus are replaced by `codecopy`. The new coder only has them once and uses them as push constants.
