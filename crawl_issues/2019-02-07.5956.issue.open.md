After a quick test, adding these seems to need more effort to be put into our script then just adding the URLs: 
- PoCo needs `npm ethereumjs-testrpc` which does not work out of the box
- Polymath needs a native `solc` to be installed (need to find out why)
- Horizon breaks while connecting to Ganache because of some network mismatch

#6104 could fix the polymath requirements.

Let's re-try at least PoCo.

We should also try 0x: https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo - it seems to use a different test setup, perhaps that is also not the right repository.

Some interesting ones: veil.co, kyber.network, bounties.network, gitcoin contracts (such as the grant eip1337), compound.finance, 0x, dai contracts (cdp portal, etc.), delphy, ens contracts, cent.co

Not fully sure if all of them have open sources, like cent.co probably doesn't.

Also USDC (https://www.centre.io/usdc) and TUSD (https://www.trusttoken.com/trueusd/) could be interesting, but they are only regular token contracts with a (un)lock, mint and burn functions.

Verfied that these can't be added yet, since they do not meet one or more requirement:

Still on Truffle 4.x.x (forcing the compiler version does not work):
- Centre Tokens: https://github.com/centrehq/centre-tokens
- Bounties Network: https://github.com/Bounties-Network/StandardBounties
- Gitcoin Contracts: https://github.com/gitcoinco/smart_contracts
- Delphy Project: https://github.com/DelphyProject/delphy-contracts (also broken `package.json`)
- Trust Token: https://github.com/trusttoken/trueUSD

pre-0.5.0:
- Kyber Network: https://github.com/KyberNetwork/smart-contracts
- Veil.co: https://github.com/veilco/veil-contracts
- Compound Finance: https://github.com/compound-finance/

Depend on node 9.3 (we could add another Circle job with node 9 installed):
- 0xProject: https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo

Do not support `petersburg`:
- ENS Domains: https://github.com/ensdomains/ens

No single Truffle project /w contracts:
- MakerDAO: https://github.com/makerdao

Testing ABIEncoderV2 with any new external project that we add is also important: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5956

@chriseth I checked the the list again and all of them seem to be still blocked. I'd try to get in touch with the people behind those projects in order to see if they're interested in being part of our test infrastructure and if they would make some effort in supporting us with that.

Is this still relevant for 0.6.0?

Moved #3127 here.

I have updated the description to add more details, some projects we brainstormed with @hrkrshnn on gitter yesterday and some links for finding more projects.

Added tokens from @erak's comment to the description. Unfortunately all of them seem to have remained on older versions. None of them is even on 0.7.x yet.

Added 11 more projects to the list in the issue description.

Unfortunately I'm not sure what to choose to integrate next - every one has some minor downside. Many rely on multiple Solidity versions which often requires workarounds. Some use a framework other than Hardhat or Truffle which will require extra work to add support for that framework in our external tests. Others are quite small and don't exercise the compiler very much.

I checked these projects in a bit more detail and here's what I'd pick based mostly on ease of integration and how important or interesting they are:
- **Bleeps**: a fancy NFT that generates sound, so a bit different from typical projects. Lots of assembly. Can be built with Hardhat and is all 0.8.9.
- **Uniswap v3**: it's still on 0.7.x but I expect it to be easy to port and I think it's important to have it. Uses Hardhat so not much extra work.
- **ElementFi**: Uses Hardhat. Is mostly on 0.8.x but unfortunately also has some 0.7.x code and requires patching.
- **Gnosis Zodiac**: Small project but uses Hardhat and is mostly on 0.8.x (just one 0.6.x file).
- **Gnosis Protocol v2** (used by cowswap): Uses Hardhat and is all on 0.7.x.
- **Yield Protocol Liquidator**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.
- **Yield Protocol Vault V2**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.
- **PoolTogether V4**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.
- **Perpetual Pools**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate.
- **PRBMath**: Hardhat, all 0.8.x. Looks easy to integrate and is a popular project. Not as big as the other ones though.

Other important/interesting projects, which look like they'll require more work. I think it would be good to integrate them eventually:
- **solmate**: A general purpose library, I think it's important to have it. Uses 0.8.10. Has lots of assembly. Requires dapptools which we do not support yet in the ext tests and I think we'll need to build a docker image for nix to use it on CircleCI.
- **DSA connectors**: Mostly on 0.7.6 with some 0.6.x contracts sprinkled in. Has lots of contracts, targetting not only Ethereum mainnet but also Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum. The contracts themselves seem to be fairly thin though and consist mostly of external calls and ABI encoding. Uses Hardhat.
- **Tornado Cash**: Not much code but on the other hand has some ZK math in it. Still on 0.7.x. Uses Truffle.
- **Raiden**: Relatively small (though has one ~70k contract). All 0.8.10. Uses an exotic framework.
- **Rarible**: Truffle, still on 0.7.6. It's a popular NFT marketplace so it would be good to have for variety. It has an unusual structure - many directories, each containing separate config.

Others that require extra work and do not seem as important/interesting:
- **OlympusDAO** (OHM): Mixes 0.5.x, 0.7.x and 0.8.x code (mostly 0.7.x), Uses Hardhat.
- **yearn lens**: Mostly 0.8.x code. Uses Brownie so requires extra work to integrate and benchmark.
- **Overlay**: All 0.8.7 and uses Brownie.
- **Unlock**: Mostly 0.8.x but also has some 0.5.x-only code. Uses Hardhat.

Too old or not interesting:
- **Liquity**: still on 0.6.x and even has some 0.4.x code. Can use Hardhat.
- **spartanswap**: seems to be targetting BSC, apparently [made by Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/0b77bd42b6e14aa6affb9225a1a15069).
- **Gnosis CoW Token**: Uses Hardhat and is all 0.8.10. Unfortunately it's just a token.

@hrkrshnn rightly pointed out that [cow-token](https://github.com/gnosis/cow-token) is really just a token and not a token + DEX as I thought. So I'm demoting it to non-interesting but I'll try to integrate [gp-v2-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts) instead, which seems to be the set of contracts behind cowswap.

Some contracts that are 0.8.*

1. https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core (0.7.6 used for some contracts :(
2. https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts
3. https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yield-utils-v2, https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yield-liquidator-v2 and https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2. Seems to 0.8.6 exclusively.
4. https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math (we already have semantic tests for this). Might be still useful.

Looks like [Optimism's contracts](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts) are mostly 0.8.9. Contracts targetting L2 would be an interesting addition.
