# [\#5959 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5959) `merged`: Introduce global optimiser settings.

Apart from exporting the settings via the metadata, this should be a pure refactoring.

Still todo:

 - [x] enable the yul optimiser based on the settings
 - [x] parse the settings from standard-json-io
 - [x] parse the settings from the commandline (do we really want 100% control from the CLI?)

If we agree on the metadata strings, we can already merge it like this.

Compilation error for emscripten:
```

I believe we already had something like that in the past. Anyone remembers how we solved it?

@chriseth The emscripten compile error is due to the emscripten build having 32-bit ``size_t`` - so to avoid the assertion from being trivial due to type constraints, we need to cast, but we have to be careful not to defeat the purpose of the assertion by doing so (due to potentially truncating during the cast...)...
The following would probably do it, but is not particularly nice:
```
solAssert(u256(m_optimiserSettings.expectedExecutionsPerDeployment) < u256(std::numeric_limits<Json::LargestUInt>::max()), "")
```
C++17 would be nice here, then we could do
```
if constexpr (sizeof(m_optimiserSettings.expectedExecutionsPerDeployment) >= sizeof(Json::LargestUInt))
    solAssert(m_optimiserSettings.expectedExecutionsPerDeployment < std::numeric_limits<Json::LargestUInt>::max(), "");
```
Maybe there's a nicer solution, but that's the problem in any case.

EDIT:
Maybe the following is best:
```
static_assert(sizeof(m_optimiserSettings.expectedExecutionsPerDeployment) <= sizeof(JSon::LargestUint));
solAssert(static_cast<JSon::LargestUint>(m_optimiserSettings.expectedExecutionsPerDeployment) < std::numeric_limits<Json::LargestUInt>::max(), "")
```

I suggest the following:
1) If any fine-grained setting is provided in standard json, then the `enabled` option cannot be present.
2) If the fine-grained settings equal to that of the default `enabled: false` or `enabled: true`, then the metadata only contains the `enabled` field, but not the fine-grained settings. Otherwise only the fine-grained settings are stored.

In 0.6.0 we may revisit dropping `enabled`.

From off-line discussion: it seems that introducing a new sub-level for optimiser "details" is a better approach.

Example:
```js
    // Optional: Optimizer settings. The fields "enabled" and "runs" are deprecated
    // and are only given for backwards-compatibility.
    optimizer: {
      enabled: true,
      runs: 200,
      details: {
          // peephole defaults to "true"
          peephole: true,
          // jumpdestRemover defaults to "true"
          jumpdestRemover: true,
          orderLiterals: false,
          deduplicate: false,
          cse: false,
          constantOptimizer: false,
          yul: true
          yulDetails: {}
      },
    },
```

Subtleties:
- if the `enabled` field is set to false, optimisations are entirely disabled and the metadata will not contain the `details` object.
- if the `enabled` field is set to true, optimisations are enabled with a default preset. The `details` object can be present and can modify these settings. If the `details` section changes any of the settings from the default present, the entire object is included in the metadata.

The `runs` parameter is still preferred to be renamed to `expectedExecutionsPerDeployment`, but that seems to be a breaking change. Also don't forget that as of late, this field is used outside of the optimiser to determine the optimal layout of the "ABI dispatcher code", therefore it is suggested to be moved outside of the `optimizer` object. This should be done in a separate change together with renaming the field.

If "details" is not a member, optimizer will be in "default disabled" mode, which mean peephole and jumpdest remover are still on.

@axic should we also add a "stackAllocation" option to the optimizer? This would then activate the `_allowStackOpt` switch of CodeTransform.

Hm, that could just be the yul optimizer option.

I think the "documentation" commit can be merged into the standard json one, and the last commit into "provide full optimiser settings".

Also fails the sourcelocation tests.

I think this needs the json uint fix to compile for emscripten.

Yeah, perhaps better to cherrypick #6114 back here.

All of the gas tests are broken and every single one becomes more expensive. Any idea why? This PR shouldn't change behaviour of the optimiser.

I also don't understand why the commandline tests changed - will have to investigate. It might be that "stack allocation" was activated before when the optimizer was activated, now it can only be activated manually.

Ok, the problem in the commandline tests was actually related to the [invalid reference](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5959#discussion_r261585495) noted above.

Yep, removed the reference and also removed the test expectation changes the reference caused.
