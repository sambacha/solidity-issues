We forced the version of tape to 4.9.2 as a [quick measure](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/339) before the release of 0.5.4. It is not clear where the problem lies, so this should be fixed properly.

Also the change in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5963 should be reverted or revisited.
