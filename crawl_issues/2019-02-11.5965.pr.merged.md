In #5833 we specifically agreed to set this to 0.5.0 for the following reason: any workarounds added to solc-js should not be assumed to be required by any 0.5.x Solidity release as the consumers should be able to use any solc-js 0.5.x version with any 0.5.x release.

I agree, but this was needed because of a problem with TAPE ( https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/commit/4456496300970f9f10486f6ba462b00848204f7f ). If you have a better solution, like manually editing package.json before running the tests, please do that!
