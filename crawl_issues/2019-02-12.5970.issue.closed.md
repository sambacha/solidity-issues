**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description
Solidity event overloading (i.e. using the same name for an event, with different parameters) does not seem to be working correctly in v 0.5.0+.
This issue may be related to #1215 

## Environment

- Compiler version: ^0.5.0
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 10d17f24
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Tested in Remix and Truffle
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce

Example code:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract Events {
    function emitEvent(bytes32 _eventName, bool _isTrue) public {
        emit LogEvent(_eventName, _isTrue);
    }
    
    function emitEvent(bytes32 _eventName, address _account) public {
        emit LogEvent(_eventName, _account);
    }
    
    event LogEvent(
        bytes32 eventName,
        bool isTrue
    );

    event LogEvent(
        bytes32 eventName,
        address account
    );
}
```

_On Remix:_
When calling `emitEvent(bytes32 _eventName, address _account)`, the correct `LogEvent` (with `address` parameter is **not** emitted. 
When calling `emitEvent(bytes32 _eventName, bool _isTrue)`, the correct `LogEvent` (with `bool`) **is** emitted.

_In Truffle:_
Only the `LogEvent` (with `bool`) is emitted when both `emitEvent` functions are executed.

Thanks for reporting! We have a test for overloaded events and it is not failing, so my first suspicion would be that this could be a bug in Remix or perhaps with the ABI.

This is the output I get from remix:

First function:

			"isTrue": true,
			"length": 2
		}
	}
]
```

Second function:
```
[
	{
		"from": "0xef55bfac4228981e850936aaf042951f7b146e41",
		"data": "0x6162630000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ef55bfac4228981e850936aaf042951f7b146e41",

		]
	}
]
```

So it looks like Remix was just not able to properly decode the data from the second event. The topic is different, which means Solidity at least emits a different event - I haven't checked the actual hash, though.

Hm, I cannot see anything wrong with the ABI either. @yann300 could you please check if this might be a problem on the remix side? Thanks!

Closing since the issue is not related to the compiler.
