# [\#5996 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5996) `merged`: Allow calldata arrays with dynamically encoded base type.

Fixes #3293 

Probably more tests missing (dynamic structs as base type? might be excluded in typechecker).

There was an error when running `test_check_style` for commit `96de5a9d49aaf0e036058410e7d5e32d91d6ac71`:
```
Coding style error:
 libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp:1549: let abs_offset_of_length := add(base_ref, calldataload(ptr_to_length))
 libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp:1550: base_ref := add(abs_offset_of_length, 0x20)
 libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp:1552: ptr_to_length := calldataload(abs_offset_of_length)

```
Please check that your changes are working as intended.

Sorry, - tons of comments. My main suspicion is the fact that the member access is tailored towards array values only, but I might have missed something.

~~Note: calldata string arrays don't seem to work (array access and conversion to memory string yields a string of correct length, but just containing zeros).~~

~~EDIT: Actually it's copies from calldata to memory for strings and bytes that doesn't seem to be working.~~

EDIT: nevermind - my test cases were incorrectly encoded... :-)

@chriseth @leonardoalt Applied small test changes and squashed a bit.
