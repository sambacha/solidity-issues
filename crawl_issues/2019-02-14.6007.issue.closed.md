# [\#6007 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6007) `closed`: Find the lost AppVeyor tests.

AppVeyor doesn't seem to run on our PRs anymore (does anybody have a counterexample?), so we should check why that is.

AppVeyor does run the the tests, but it doesn't communicate with Github anymore. You're account needs to be linked with the `ethereum-free` one. @chriseth can probably help with the missing permissions.

I think what fixed it was to give @chfast write permission to the solidity repo - his account is linked to the ethereum-free account on appveyor.
