# [\#6008 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6008) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Assert type is not function when assigning

We cannot assign function types since that's HOL and not supported by SMT solvers. Assigning abstract types is fine. The added test used to throw.

Wouldn't it be a nicer commit title if you describe why it can't be a function rather than repeating the commit content? e.g. "SMTChecker: Assert for unsupported types" or so

@Marenz commit or PR title? I usually just headline in the PR title and explain the reason in the first comment since the title can't be very long.

I meant commit title. I mean, my approach is always that the title should (with as few words as possible) explain the WHY, where as the body of the commit msg should elaborate and summarize if the complexity calls for it (not here e.g.)

The interesting thing is almost always the motivation for a commit, not what exactly it does. The what you can read in the commit itself.

I would argue the opposite: that the commit message should summarize what it's doing, such that reviewers can know what to expect from the code. Then the body (or a PR comment) can explain why the changes are necessary.

@Marenz damn, you noticed ;)
Please put it on the agenda for this week's meeting.
