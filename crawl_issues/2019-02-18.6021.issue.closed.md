# [\#6021 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6021) `closed`: [Yul] Function definitions do not block scope early enough
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Found by @bshastry :

The following compiles:
```
{
  {
    function c() {} // here, both functions are visible and should lead to syntax error
  }
  function c() {}
}
```

While this does not compile:
```
{
  function c() {}
  {
    function c() {} // here, both functions are visible and should lead to syntax error
  }
}
```

The reason is that functions are registered only when they are visited during the AST traversal, even though they are visible in the full block they are defined in.

As a proposed fix, it might make sense to first visit all FunctionDefinitions inside a Block and then all other statements, since functions open a scope of their own (regarding variables) anyway.
