# [\#6061 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6061) `closed`: Cyclic Imports are not possible in 0.5+
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3839700?v=4" width="50">[nuevoalex](https://github.com/nuevoalex) opened issue at [2019-02-21 02:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6061):

## Description / Steps to Reproduce

Interaction: I have two contracts:

#### `Parent.sol`
```
import 'trading/Child.sol';
contract Parent {
    Child public child;
}
```
#### `Child.sol`
```
import 'reporting/Parent.sol';
contract Child {
    Parent public parent;
}
```

Prior to 0.5 this can be achieved in my code base by using an empty prefix remapping. As that is no longer permitted in 0.5+ I attempted to use a prefix of `ROOT` and added this to my imports. However this results in errors such as:

```
core/source/contracts/reporting/Parent.sol:2:1: DeclarationError: Identifier already declared.
E               contract Parent {
E               ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
E               core/source/contracts/reporting/Parent.sol:1:1: The previous declaration is here:
E               import 'ROOT/trading/Child.sol';
```

I believe this is due to how the files are keyed when doing compilation as indicated in this issue: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2665. I can reproduce this on an earlier compiler version by using the prefix in my remappings as well but now that an empty prefix is not allowed I do not believe there is a workaround for this.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated as this blocks moving the Augur contracts to 0.5.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.4
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Raw Solc
- Operating system: Ubuntu

Could you provide the full commandline or standard-json input you use for this? Thanks!

I wonder what is the reason for doing it this way and not by creating interfaces?

@axic For the real use case this is actually occurring with interfaces where interface A imports interface B which imports interface A. I'm currently bypassing this in our case by manually skipping those contract interfaces in the compilation step.

@chriseth : Similar to the one in the previous issue 
```

    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {
        "filename": {
            "urls": [ "/app/src/reporting/Parent.sol" ]
        }
    },

                "*": [ 'metadata', 'evm.bytecode', 'evm.sourceMap', 'abi' ]
            }
        }

@nuevoalex as explained in the previous issue, if you use `"filename": { "urls": [...] }` then the name of the source file is `filename` and not `Parent.sol`. Is this really the full input? I'm asking because it only specifies a single file - is the rest auto-discovered by the compiler?

I was able to reproduce it, and in its basic form, it is fully unrelated to remappings.

If the input is in the following form, it does not work:
```
{
    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {
        "filename": {
            "urls": [ "/tmp/a/reporting/Parent.sol" ]
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "remappings": [ "ROOT=/app/src" ],
        "optimizer": {
            "enabled": true,
            "runs": 200
        },
        "outputSelection": {
            "*": {
                "*": [ "metadata", "evm.bytecode", "evm.sourceMap", "abi" ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you replace the name of the file by its actual name, though, it works:
```
{
    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {
        "reporting/Parent.sol": {
            "urls": [ "/tmp/a/reporting/Parent.sol" ]
        }
    },
    "settings": {
        "remappings": [ "ROOT=/app/src" ],
        "optimizer": {
            "enabled": true,
            "runs": 200
        },
        "outputSelection": {
            "*": {
                "*": [ "metadata", "evm.bytecode", "evm.sourceMap", "abi" ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the first form, you tell the compiler that there is a filename called `filename` with some contents (wherever they may come from). This file thin imports "trading/Child.sol" which in turn imports "reporting/Parent.sol". The compiler does not see that this is the same file - because you gave it a different name and because of that loads it as a different file.

This also raises the question why do we allow importing files through jsonio which are not specified in the `sources` list?

I think every accessible file should be listed and the read callback is used if they are listed by path/url and not by content.

Doing so would make the behaviour of standard json through `solc` and other means similar.

We have to allow auto-discovery because otherwise, tools need to parse the files and discover dependencies themselves. We could require the file name to match, perhaps.

So the fix is to make the compiler aware that even though the name differs, the two files are the same?

I would say the fix is to use the same name for the same file, i.e. "not a bug".

Hmm can we still detect it and at least issue a warning?

You mean if we have two identical files with different names? Not sure if that would not have false positives...
