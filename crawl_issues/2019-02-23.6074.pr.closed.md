# [\#6074 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6074) `closed`: Grammar tweaks

### Description

I am proposing the following two updates to the grammar:

-  ~~The loops `DoWhileStatement`, `WhileStatement` , `ForStatement` and the `IfStatement` contain `Statement` production rules to process statements. This is however not explicit enough even though `Statement` does contain `Block` along with the other statements. The production rule implies that an `IfStatement` for instance can produce another `IfStatement` after `'if' '(' Expression ')'`. This is not correct syntax because a nested `IfStatement` needs to be in a `Block` and can not have another `IfStatement` as an immediate parent.~~

-  A `VariableDeclaration` can not be optional when multiple `VariableDeclaration`s are defined as part of a `VariableDefinition`. 

This is more of question that came up when reading the grammar. Is there a specific reason why `Throw` is still a part of the grammar even though it is not a valid statement anymore since 0.5.x?

Are you sure? These seem to compile:
```
contract C {
  function f() pure public {
    if (true)
      if (true)
      {}
  }
}
```

```
contract C {
  function f(uint a, uint b) pure public {
    if (a % 2 == 1)
      if (a == 2)
      {}
  }
}
```

Yeah agreed @axic. The grammar is correct in that respect. 

Looking at `Statement` again there seems to be cases though where the grammar does not produce valid Solidity code. Specifically the loop specific statements `Break` and `Continue` and `PlaceholderStatement` for modifiers are not valid within all statements. For example using `break` in the `if` statement is correct syntax according to the current grammar. 

```
contract C {
  function f() pure public {
    if (true) break;
  }
}
```

My attempt to write new production rules are in the latest updates to the PR. I am not very experienced with writing grammars so let me know what you guys think and if you generally agree that this is an issue in the current grammar.

A context-free grammar can never catch the full extend of the language. I would prefer to keep the grammar simple instead of trying to capture everything that a context-free grammar can possibly capture. Note that the parser also parses `break` statements outside loops. It is just a later stage in the compiler that performs these checks.

Closing for now. Please feel free to re-open.

@chriseth fair enough.
