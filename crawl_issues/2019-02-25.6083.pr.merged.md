This needs to be rebased :-).

@ekpyron This repo moves quickly! Rebased and squashed.

OK @chriseth @bshastry and @ekpyron I have attempted to incorporate all your suggestions. What do you think now?

@ekpyron That was an attempt to break the lines out to make it more readable. Maybe that wasn't successful?

@ChrisChinchilla It's fine, I just didn't read carefully enough earlier. The only thing left I see is that we might consider moving the "negative ``y``" case to the top of the list (strictly speaking the first three cases in the list are only true for positive ``y``...). But maybe that's not necessary - I'm fine with this now either way in any case!
