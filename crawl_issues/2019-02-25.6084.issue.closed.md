# [\#6084 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6084) `closed`: Switch EVM version to petersburg by default

Given "Constantinople" should go live 28th of February and 0.5.0 is planned for 5th of March I'd suggest we switch Constantinople on by default to provide gas savings.

Yep, sounds good!

If agree on #6086 we should actually set it to "Petersburg".

I'm not too sure about that. People probably wonder what is meant by that...

Depends on #6086.

Turns out this will break Remix. Either https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/issues/1282 or https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide/issues/1620 needs to be finished, cc @yann300.

I'd however argue we shouldn't revert this change because the feature requests have been out for a year.

Confirmed locally that latest remix works with the compiler and shift instructions work both in the debugger as well as in the VM.
