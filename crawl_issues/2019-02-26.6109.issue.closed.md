## Description

(Found by ossfuzz: 	13415)

The following contract

```
contract n{function(){var(x)=();assembly{e(x)}}}
```

triggers a null dereference here

Minimal example:
```
contract n {
  function(){
    var (x) = ();
    assembly{
      x
    }
  }
}
```

I think it is due the variable resolve for inline assembly doesn't take care of `var` after it has been removed.

In the type checker we have behaviour like this:
```
contract n {
  function(){
    var (x) = ();
    x;
  }
}
```

```
6109.sol:3:5: Error: Different number of components on the left hand side (1) than on the right hand side (0).
    var (x) = ();
    ^----------^
6109.sol:4:5: Error: Declaration referenced before type could be determined.
    x;
    ^
```

The error 

> Error: Declaration referenced before type could be determined

is triggered by checking the type() for nullptr. I initially used the same method to fix this, but @chriseth was worried that there might be many other places where a missing type can cause problems so now we trigger a fatal error if variables are still left without type after the `var` type guessing code (see  PR)
.
