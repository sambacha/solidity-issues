Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6102

This might be considered a breaking change, but we also plan to move the default VM to Constantinople with this release, so it's probably not a big deal.

Outside of syntax errors and other nitpicking I think the change looks good. In the future however if we add experimental opcodes not fully part of any hard fork yet, then we may need to revisit so that Dmitry can generate test cases in testeth using Solidity, but this is not a problem right now.

We can add an experimental VM version whose name is only known to dmitry :)

Apparently in ~3 hours.
