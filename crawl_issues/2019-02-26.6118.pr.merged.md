# [\#6118 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6118) `merged`: Use stack optimizations.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5914

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5959

This still needs
 - [x] checks that it works with references to local valiables
 - [x] probably its own entry in the global optimizer settings
 - [x] changelog entry

@axic what about moving the setting to the details with a default of "true" if the yul optimizer is active? Should we display the details always as part of the metadata whenever the yul optimizer is activated?

If it cannot be selected separately I wouldn't include it as a setting. Just enable it if Yul is enabled?

> Should we display the details always as part of the metadata whenever the yul optimizer is activated?

I think we should only display options if they can be set on the input side.

Hm, I think we have a misunderstanding there. I was proposing (input -> metadata output):

`details: { yul: true }` -> `details:{yul: true, yulDetails: {stackAllocation: true}}`

`details: { yul: true, yulDetails: {stackAllocation: false} }` -> `details:{yul: true, yulDetails: {stackAllocation: false}}`

`details: { yul: true, yulDetails: {stackAllocation: true} }` -> `details:{yul: true, yulDetails: {stackAllocation: true}}`


`details: { yul: false }` -> `details:{yul: false}`

While all other combinations are invalid for now.

I think it is fine to put below `yulDetails` and turn it on by default.

Actually I think this needs a test that the stack allocation setting is actually used. It is probably bad to do a bytecode comarison based one, but we could do a more clever check inside test/StandardCompiler.

We should also somehow test how the commandline interface passes the option.

And: we should check how this affects inline assembly.

One could probably construct an everywhere-immovable-expressions function that will throw the stack height error without the optimization and won't with the optimization and use that as a test.

It turned out, the flag was actually not properly passed along from the commandline interface.
