# [\#6119 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6119) `closed`: Solc src mappings problems

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15844703?v=4" width="50">[norhh](https://github.com/norhh) opened issue at [2019-02-26 19:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6119):

## Description
The src-map doesn't seem to be that accurate, In some cases the srcmap points towards comments.
## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.0
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): byzantium
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Ubuntu

## Steps to Reproduce
Below is the line_mapping code which prints out the PC and it's corresponding line number
```
import json
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen


def _get_solc_mappings(srcmap, solidity_files):
    """The line mappings function"""
    prev_item = []
    PC = 1
    for item in srcmap:
        mapping = item.split(":")
        mapping += prev_item[len(mapping):]   # if the length is less then previous mapping length then take the previous mapping values of the rest
        for index in range(len(mapping)):
            if mapping[index] == "":          # Fill up all empty values with it's previous values
                mapping[index] = int(prev_item[index])

        offset, length, idx, _ = mapping      # offset:length:file_no:jump format
        offset = int(offset)
        idx = int(idx)
        lineno = (
             solidity_files[idx].encode("utf-8")[0:offset].count("\n".encode("utf-8")) + 1
        )
        prev_item = mapping
        print("PC: {}, line_no: {}".format(PC, lineno))
        PC += 1


def main():
    cmd = ["solc", "--combined-json", "srcmap-runtime", "./BECToken.sol"]
    p = Popen(cmd, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)

    stdout, stderr = p.communicate()
    ret = p.returncode

    out = stdout.decode("UTF-8")
    json_data = json.loads(out)
    solidity_files = []
    for filename in json_data["sourceList"]:
        with open(filename, "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            code = file.read()
            solidity_files.append(code)

    srcmap = json_data["contracts"]['./BECToken.sol:PausableToken']["srcmap-runtime"].split(";")
    _get_solc_mappings(srcmap, solidity_files)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
the contract on which it is run is BECToken.sol which can be found here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConsenSys/mythril-classic/develop/solidity_examples/BECToken.sol ,
After executing, It can be clearly seen in the output that at some addresses the src is pointed to line numbers 3-4 which are comments. Am I making any mistake here?

The compiler sometimes provides source links to source files internal to the compiler. In that case, the source index is `-1`. Can you check if that is the case? I think `solidity_files[-1]` in python does not generate an error, does it?

@chriseth , thanks for the reply, that seems to be the case, Can you mention where that internal file exists in the solidity build? that might be quite helpful

They are not really files, they are just generated source code snippets. So it might be better to just remove these annotations.

Cool, thanks :+1:
