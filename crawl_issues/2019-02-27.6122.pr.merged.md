Sorry about the many comments. I think this is very useful, especially also mentioning how to use it in Vyper. I just realized rather late that you probably just copied the Wiki article, did you?

You can continue cleaning up the WIki article, but if you want, we can also take over. In any case, please rebase instead of merging.

I think @fulldecent also created that Wiki page, as it was missing last week, and I was in the process of getting access to bring it back, to then find today that @fulldecent had recreated/reproduced it. I'm not really sure of what supposed to be in that wiki verses the Solidity docs, but any changes we do end up making to the content in this PR should also find their way to https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format or, we remove the page in that wiki and instead link to the page we create here to reduce duplication.

Rebased, many updates made to improve RST formatting and content.

Added opinionated statement:

> It is recommended that Solidity contracts are fully annotated using NatSpec for all public interfaces (everything in the ABI).

Again, this is surely a best practice, but it would be better if this is said directly in the Solidity documentation.

Yes this was copy-pasted from the Wiki. Yes, I am a contributor to that wiki.

My main motivation is that the wiki is prone to vandalism and is not a place to publish standards. Solidity implements NatSpec and has an interest to see that it is documented properly.

I am hoping to get this PR up. And then continue to make improvements. Then I also want to propose a change to the behavior of solc related to NatSpec. But I can't do that until I can actually cite a specification for NatSpec!

@fulldecent Syntax changes generally look a lot better to me in the diff view, but I may do a little final polish, checking and testing locally, but also need some further input from @chriseth on technical side, wether we include the doc here etc etc.

Thank you. I believe all comments are handled at this point.

I have added my agenda for reforms as follow on items (i.e. after the instant issue/PR is closed) at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6121

If/when this PR is merged then I will work on motivating/starting implementation for each of those items.

@chriseth Thank you for the feedback. I believe all issues are addressed now.
