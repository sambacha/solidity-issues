### Description

While looking at issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2614 I thought the pragma docs could do with better linking and some polish on language. I didn't directly address https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2614#issuecomment-318414701 though, if that still is needed?

### Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles correctly
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [ ] Used meaningful commit messages
