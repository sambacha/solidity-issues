Frequently search engines searches of solidity docs return results from older docs versions, we should figure out how to prioritise results from the most recent version.

When searching for keywords and include the Solidity version number you're using, search engines returns better results and looking at the Sphinx documentation the most we could do is [show a warning when not looking at the latest version](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html#version-warning).

We could be more particular with results in https://ethsear.ch/ perhaps, @jrhea?

Readthedocs already shows the version warning.

@elenadimitrova sorry i missed this.  how can i help?  i can modify the crawler and seed it with a particular url and blacklist the rest.  would that help?

On every page it shows this ([example](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.3/types.html):

I think it is fine to close this issue.
