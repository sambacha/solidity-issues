Perhaps to simplify this, as a first step one could add full support to the parser and rejecting it in the analyser. I think that would be safe to merge even now, without the need to update optimisers.

I think the scope helpers should be their own PR.

Needs guards in the following files (just to be safe, might be that no change is needed):

 - data flow analyzer
 - redundant assign eliminator

Please add `{ for {} true {} { function f() { break } } }` as a parser test (should fail).
