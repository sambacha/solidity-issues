Some of the scripts could be updated, such that they
- support multiple signatures for the team: `scripts/release_ppa.sh`
- are less error-prone: `scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh release`

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
