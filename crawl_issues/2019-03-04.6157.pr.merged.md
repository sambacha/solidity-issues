The remaining 4 places cannot be changed
```
                m_context << max(u256(32u), arrayType.memorySize());
                utils().allocateMemory();
```

because `memorySize()` is `u256`. I'm not sure why those have to be a bignum, when even if they exceed 32-bit would be infeasible gas wise.

We could also change `allocateMemory` to take `u256` now with the intention we clean up this later.

Made the change, it takes `u256`. If happy, please squash before merge.

The main point of this change is to avoid a `SWAP1` where possible, which should help the optimiser in some cases.

Tests fail because there are gas savings.
