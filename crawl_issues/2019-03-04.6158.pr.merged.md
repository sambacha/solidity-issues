Why is it only relevant here? We should force the boost version so that the bug is fixed.

It only happens if the shift amount has multiple bits set and at least one of them is shifted out. The rest of the cases in `RuleList` only shift `u256(1)` so those should be fine. Not sure about the rest of the codebase.

This PR is only about documentation/explanation. I hope we can have another PR which force 1.65.1.

I disagree, it is not just about documentation. It implements a workaround. I would prefer to use the proper fix instead of a workaround.

It doesn't implement the workaround. The workaround is there already, this pulls it out into a helper.

Ah, I see, sorry!
