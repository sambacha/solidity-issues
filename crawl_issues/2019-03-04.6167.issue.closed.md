# [\#6167 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6167) `closed`: Gas calculation for ComputeMethod should take care of shifts in ConstantOptimiser
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

#6073 added support for using shifts in the constant optimiser, however forgot to update the gas estimation.

This doesn't pose any risk, just the possibility that efficient cases will be turned down.

Can you provide some more details, please?

From the chat:

>axic: The ComputeMethod::calculateGas still valvulates it based on EXP. I think it actually may be okay brcause that turns into 0, but does it need to account for the cost of shift?

From the chat:
> chriseth: calculateGas: I don't think so. The exps are just prominent because they have non-constant gas costs. It calls simpleRunGas which just counts the gas for the instructions.
