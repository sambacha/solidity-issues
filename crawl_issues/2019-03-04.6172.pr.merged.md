Hm, what could happen is that the code size somehow oscillates...

True, hadn't thought about that...

I'm wondering whether we could/should consider an increasing code size a bug and actually throw, but I'm not sure.

It can easily increase through inlining.

True - maybe code size is not a good metric for this after all. The metric for stopping should probably be something that we at least aim to minimize during optimization (or in the best case which we can even guarantee to be monotonously decreasing during each iteration) and that's not necessarily (global) code size (alone)...

For now it might be enough to keep a maximum number of runs (higher than the original ``4``) to eventually stop in oscillating cases... but in fact I'm not so sure about code size as metric anymore in general.

Yes of course, code size is just a stand-in for "nothing changed". I'll add the worst-case check.
