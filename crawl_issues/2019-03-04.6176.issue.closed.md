# [\#6176 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6176) `closed`: Add a more verbose error message for "stack too deep" errors

## Abstract

After merging two branches I have stumbled over `InternalCompilerError: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.`. There is no information about the error location. I'm having around 20 changed contracts to be checked manually.

## Motivation
It would be really great if we had a more verbose error message containing at least a filename.

This issue had been already fixed before, but now it has arisen again.
