# [\#6181 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6181) `closed`: Strict assembly optimizer throws exception when _literal.kind != LiteralKind::Number for switch case statements containing string as well as integer literals
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

Here's the smallest example I could reduce this problem to

```
echo "{switch 0 case\"\"{} case 2{}}" | ./solc/solc --strict-assembly --optimize -
```

The exception thrown comes from here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/eb5bde95b37b3d943644ce3c0ab20517fcafdc38/libyul/Utilities.cpp#L34

which is called from the structural simplifier phase of the optimizer here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/eb5bde95b37b3d943644ce3c0ab20517fcafdc38/libyul/optimiser/StructuralSimplifier.cpp#L110-L121

Interestingly switch statement that contain a string literal in case statement do not pose a problem to the non-optimized code generation as shown by the CLI snippet below

```
$ $ echo "{switch 0 case\"\"{} case 2{}}" | ./solc/solc --strict-assembly -
                           
======= <stdin> (EVM) =======
    
Pretty printed source:
object "object" {
    code {                
        switch 0
        case "" {          
        }
        case 2 {
        }                  
    } 
}                         
      
     
Binary representation:

```

### Notes

- First case statement is actually an empty string literal `""`
- case statements with only string literal or only integer do not trigger the exception (see cli snippets below)
- at least two case statements needed to trigger issue

```
$ echo "{switch 0 case\"\"{}}" | ./solc/solc --strict-assembly --optimize -
======= <stdin> (EVM) =======

Pretty printed source:
object "object" {
    code {
    }
}
