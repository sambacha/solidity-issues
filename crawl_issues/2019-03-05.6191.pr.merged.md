### Description

This PR does the following
  - Imposes a hard limit of 600 bytes for test inputs for the proto fuzzers
  - Adds a cosmetic fix for the constant optimizer fuzzer

The hard limit does not affect code coverage. It makes fuzzing more efficient since we are providing the fuzzer a minimal set of test inputs for mutation.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
