# [\#6202 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6202) `closed`: [Yul] Remove special treatment of for loop pre block in all steps
**Labels**: `help wanted`, `good first issue`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-03-06 11:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6202):

Since we have the "for loop init rewriter" as part of the yul optimizer now, we can actually remove the handling of the complicated scoping rules in e.g. the data flow analyzer, the redundant assign eliminator and others and instead assert in those components that for loops have an empty pre block.

I started investigating this issue yesterday and would be glad to work on this. For some reason I cannot press "Express Interest" button on Gitcoin (it says "authentication failure")

Edit: Gitcoin keeps returning 500 and says "You must be authenticated via github to use this feature!
". I guess I will try to solve other issues instead :)

These users each claimed they can complete the work by 11 months, 3 weeks from now.
Please review their action plans below:


**1) [nanspro](https://gitcoin.co/profile/nanspro) has been approved to start work.**

I just went through YUL's documentation and understood it's syntax, grammar, AST. 
I am reading optimiser's README right now to understand more about different components and how they help in optimise. Next step after this would be going through code of relevant files.
I really want to contribute to solidity :), that's why i am applying first, after understanding this issue more i'll share my thoughts on issue itself.

Okay so the for loop initializing condition is set before the loop thanks to init rewriter, and the tools which doesn't consider this fact needs to be changed and this should be set as default that loops now have an empty pre block.
*Cloning* now to understand the codebase
