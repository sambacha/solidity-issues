This is obviously still lacking tests, but I think otherwise this might be all that's needed.

I'd actually like to add tests for a struct with a nested array of another struct (both for a statically and dynamically encoded ones), but @erak needs to add support for arrays of structs to the test file parser :-) (->  #6217).
If you think it's fine we can merge as is, though.

I removed the [WIP] tag for now - if somebody comes up with more test cases we should have, I'll add them.

~~Also: recursive structs are still disallowed in the type checker so far - should we lift that restriction?~~ EDIT: ah yeah - they cannot even be named as ABI type, that's it :-).
