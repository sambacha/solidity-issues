# [\#6216 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6216) `closed`: Pass (large) strings by value and move if they are to be consumed
**Labels**: `good first issue`

Especially when setting the source input of the compiler, these strings are passed by const reference. This forces a copy which would actually be unnecessary. The recommended way of passing data that is consumed/stored by the function/method is to pass by value and move into the member variable.

There are several instances where solidity sources stored in strings are copied instead of moved like that, for example in `CompilerStack::addSource`. This should be fixed.

Hi, quick question for further clarification...

The function you mention it is defined as such:
```
CompilerStack::addSource(string const& _name, ...)
```

Variable `_name` is passed as a constant reference, which you say forces an unnecessary copy.

It is my understanding that in cpp passing by constant reference does not cause a copy.

Citing [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.3.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r3.cbclx01/cplr233.htm):
_Pass-by-references is more efficient than pass-by-value, because it does not copy the arguments._

So my question is where does the unnecessary copy occur?

You are right that passing by `const&` does not cause a copy when calling the function, but if the function consumes the argument, it has to copy it somewhere, and this is where the copy occurs. If you pass by value instead, it can result in a copy and a move in the worst case, but it two moves in the good case, and this is what we aim for. The article you cite is probably outdated.

Looks pretty straight forward. 

AP:
- modify any functions taking in the source such that it passes by value
- briefly check if this is happening anywhere else
