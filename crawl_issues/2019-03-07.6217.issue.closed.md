# [\#6217 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6217) `closed`: [soltest] Support struct/tuple array arguments in extracted semantics tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-03-07 14:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6217):

Structs are encoded as tuples, ``struct S { uint256 a; }`` becomes ``(uint256)``. However, the test file parser only allows brackets ``[]`` after identifiers, not after closing parenthesis, so ``(uint256)[]``, which is the ABI type of ``S[]`` does not work.

@erak, can you change that ;-)?
