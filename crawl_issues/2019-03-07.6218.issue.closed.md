# [\#6218 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6218) `closed`: [soltest] Output too long return values in extracted semantic tests.

Let's say I want to find out how the type ``SomeType`` is ABI encoded. I can write:
```
contract C {
  function getCalldataEncoding(SomeType x) returns (bytes memory) { return msg.data; }
  function f() returns (bytes msg.data) {
      SomeType x = ...;
      return this.getCalldataEncoding(x);
  }
}
// ----
// f() ->
```
However to convince ``isoltest`` to actually give me the encoding, I have to guess how long it is and add an appropriate number of zeros to the expectations - that's quite inconvenient.

It would help, if the error messages at least included the expected size and actual size of the return data, if they mismatch - then I'd at least know at once how many zeros to add instead of having to blindly guess and try :-).

It would be even better, if everything after the expected size that's still larger than 32 bytes is encoded as integer and at some point a potential <32 bytes tail as hex string (or the entire tail as hex string).

Similarly for too short encodings ``isoltest`` should probably still output whatever is there...
