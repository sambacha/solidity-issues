# [\#6220 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6220) `closed`: Change regular calldata arrays to only use a single stack slot

`msg.data` should be a different type that still occupies two stack slots - or we might also just use `calldatasize` for that as a size.

All other calldata arrays should just be pointers to the position in calldata that stores the length.

An argument for the type of ``msg.data`` storing the length on the stack would be that then that type could be a general "array view" type that could represent subranges of calldata arrays.

I'm unassigning this again for now - depending on the progress of ABIEncoderV2 it might be much simpler to only do this change after it is the default.

Doing this now will be a bit more complicated, since calldata array slices would no longer have the same stack layout as dynamic calldata arrays. Hence somewhat related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7423

@ekpyron are we still set on this?

Ah sorry, this is still useful, I think I was confused.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
