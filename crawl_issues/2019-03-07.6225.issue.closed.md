# [\#6225 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6225) `closed`: Yul proto spec: Only allow references of declared variables
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-03-07 17:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6225):

## Description

At the moment, the yul test generator can generate yul programs such as the following
```
let x_11 := 1
if x_12 {
<do_something>
}
```

Instead, we should aim to generate something like the following
```
let x_11 := 1
if x_11 {
<do_something>
}
```

This issue tracks support for referencing declared variables only.
