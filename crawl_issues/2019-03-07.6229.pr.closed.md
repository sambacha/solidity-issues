Small step towards reproducible builds.
Refer to https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/deterministic-build-systems/#cmake-notes.
We don't need RPATH set anyways, since we're not building any shared libraries that we might want to have available while running in the build directory (that's what RPATH is for).

Need to verify that this is actually needed, since we don't build shared libraries - CMake might be clever enough to not set it in this case.

Ok, CMake *is* clever enough, so we don't need this.
