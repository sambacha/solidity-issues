Deep copy of a `SourceUnit`.

The goal is that this is used by the SMTChecker to perform some syntactical changes to make the SMT encoding easier.

So far it implements enough to run
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C
{
  function f(bool x) public pure {
    assert(x);
  }
}
```

The annotations are not there yet, it needs an analysis run.

Depending on the outcome of this, we could simplify the AST before code generation as well... might simplify stuff like having to descend in one-element tuples and so on there as well...
