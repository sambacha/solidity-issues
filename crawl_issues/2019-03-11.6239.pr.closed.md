Can you squash this and split into separate pull requests: one per feature and perhaps one that contains all bug fixes?

Okay. I guess one PR per feature would mean one PR each for supporting, (1) For, (2) Switch Case, (3) shift left/right, and (4) string literal+hex literal support?

If this is too fine-grained you can also combine it, but please do not combine features and bugfixes.

The bug fix portion of this PR has been taken into #6291 

Since that has already been merged, I will rebase and update this PR taking all comments here into account.

Thank you all for your comments. This PR has now been split #6291 #6297 and #6307 . Another separate PR for for loop and switch statement is pending.

Your comments in this PR are not in vain :) I have incorporated them in the individual PRs listed above. I am closing this PR now since it is no longer coherent.
