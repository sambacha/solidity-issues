I don't see a reason not to allow this for ABIEncoderV1 - is there?

TODO: needs more tests (especially arrays of arrays, converting to memory, and passing down to external function calls, which should copy to memory; also assigning to such a variable, etc.).

I think I'll postpone this until ``ABIFunctions::conversionFunction`` can handle arrays.

Closing this for now, since it can be easily recreated as far as it stands and it might be a while until Yul-array-conversions are implemented.
