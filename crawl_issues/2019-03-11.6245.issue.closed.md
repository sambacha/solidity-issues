I've seen at EthCC that solidity 0.6.0 will includes keywords `override` and `virtual`. This is awesome! However, an additional keyword to delete function could be very nice to have.

Example, I have a smart contract `A` that implements a complexe ownership mechanism and a `verify(something)` function. I could want to have a smart contract `B` i herite all of `A`'s code, except for the `verify` function that will be replaced (but not overriden) by `verify(something different)`.

This will reduce the cost of deploying `B` and reduce the risk of error when calling the `verify` function.

If I understand you correctly, you are proposing to remove functions from the external ABI of a contract - is that right? In that case, I don't think this is a good idea because it is incompatible with inheritance rules:

If `x` is an instance of `B` which inherits from `A`, then the full interface of `A` has to be available on `x` because you can always convert `x` to the type `A`.

Note that functions that are essentially unused because they are overridden will not be part of the bytecode - this should already be the case now.

@Amxx is that what you meant?

yes,

an example of usage for me was to have a contract be ownable but without the possibility to ever change the ownership. In my case I inherit from openzeppelin's owable contract and add:

    	function transferOwnership(address) public { revert("disabled"); }

I'd much rather have put something like

        delete transferOwnership(address) public;

so the function doesn't even appear in the ABI, and no one tries to call it to then have its transaction reverted

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I still think what @Amxx proposed is a desired feature. 
``
    delete transferOwnership(address) public;
``
I am in need to deleting methods I am not using from inheriting from some Openzeppelin contracts.
