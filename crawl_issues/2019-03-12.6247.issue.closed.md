```{{Instruction::AND, {{Instruction::BYTE, {X, Y}}, {u256(0xff)}}}, [=]() -> Pattern { return {Instruction::BYTE, {X, Y}}; }, false},``` was added in #6159.

I think this can be strengthened to ``and(byte(x,y),c) -> byte(x,y)``, whenever ``(c&0xFF)==0xFF``.

Maybe better: we can add an additional rule ``and(byte(x,y),c) -> and(byte(x,y),c&0xFF)`` instead. The strengthened rule proposed above will then be a special case of this additional rule plus the already present rule ``and(byte(x,y),0xFF) -> byte(x,y)``.

I think this and many other issues can be summarized under tracking value ranges and bit masks of expressions. I'm not sure whether we should do that as part of the old optimizer, though.

Oh and furthermore: I would also like to have a framework that can optimize the following
```
if eq(x, 0) {
  mstore(mul(y, x), 9)
}
```
into
```
if eq(x, 0) {
  mstore(0, 9)
}
```

This could also be achieved by value tracking. `lt` / `gt` should also be taken into account.

That'd be nice, yes.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
