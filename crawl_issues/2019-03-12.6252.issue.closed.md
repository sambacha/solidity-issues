# [\#6252 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6252) `closed`: Yul: track value ranges and bit masks of variables
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-03-12 21:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6252):

The Yul optimizer should track value ranges and bit masks for variables and use them during optimization / expression simplification.

Example: The code
```
if eq(x, 0) { mstore(x, 1) }
```
could be simplified to
```
if eq(x, 0) { mstore(0, 1) }
```

In general, branches restrict value ranges and bit masks of variables, even though this might be hard to track, especially if in the above case, the `eq(x, 0)` is hidden behind another variable.

In the following situations, the value range or bit mask of a variable might be deduced:

 - `lt` in comparison with branches
 - the results of `and` and other bitwise operations
 - the results of shifts
 - the results of opcodes like `address`, `byte`  or `mulmod`

If the value ranges or bit masks are known, we can use them to simplify certain expressions.
For example `if lt(x, 10) { if lt(x, 20) { .. } }` can be simplified to `if lt(x, 10) { if 1 { ... } }`.

Most of the time, the operations that can be optimized are the same that restrict the value ranges or bit masks.

Also, this module should take into account branches that do not finish due to their use of opcodes. Example:

```
if lt(x, 10) { revert(0, 0) }
let y := gt(x, 9)
```
->
```
if lt(x, 10) { revert(0, 0) }
let y := 1
```

Can we optimize the following?
```
if gt(x, 1000) { revert(0, 0) }
let y := calldataload(0)
if gt(y, 1000) { revert(0, 0) }
for {let i := 0} lt(i, x) { i := add(i, 1) }
{
  // The following condition is always true,
  // mainly because we can infer lt(i, x) -> lt(i, add(x, y))
  // since x and y are bounded.
  if lt(i, add(x, y)) { revert(0, 0) }
}
```

The above can be optimized if we track the following information for each expression and variable:
 - list of
   - bit ranges
   - value ranges
   - relations to variables: Y +- c <= . <= Z +- c
     (those have to be cleared whenever Y is reassigned)

It turns out, LLVM does a similar value range tracking.


For each branch, enter the condition. If it is lt/gt/eq where one of the arguments is a variable, add restriction.
if both are expressions: lt(e1, e2) add upper(e1) +1 <= lower(e2) - if there is no overflow.

If a branch is non-continuing, add the negation of the expression to the continuing branch.

With the example above, we get:

```
after line 1:
 x <= 1000
after line 3:
 y <= 1000
inside the for loop: (before we enter the post part)
 i <= x - 1      -   is this a condition for i or for x?
 1 <= x

Then in line 9:
 add(x, y): we check that we have no overflow, because the sum can be at most 2000
   (for each variable, we have a function that returns the smallest constant upper bound)
 so we get the restrictions:
  1 <= add(x, y) <= 2000
  x <= (take constant lower bound for y)
  y + 1 <= (take constant lower bound for x)
 and now we check whether i + 1 <= add(x, y) is a possibility.
 if one of ther upper bounds of i + 1 is less or equal than one of the lower bounds for add(x, y),
 it is always true.
 one of the upper bounds for i + 1 is x
 one of the lower bounds for add(x, y) is x
 -> always true 
```

Another nice challenge (part of the ABI decoder):
```
if iszero(slt(rel_offset_of_tail, sub(sub(calldatasize(), base_ref), sub(<neededLength>, 1)))) { revert(0, 0) }
```

We might need a generic expression structure, for example if we have code like the following:
```
let x := calldataload(0)
let y := add(x, 10)
// at this point, we cannot have any meaningful restriction on the value of y, especially due to overflow
if lt(x, 20) {
  // here we have a restriction on x and thus on y,
  // but if we compute the restriction at the time of assignment,
  // it does not help us here.
}
```

Hm, the above might actually not be a problem, since we can add the constraints `x + 10 <= y <= x + 10`, without evaluating it. The point where we make use of the constraint is where we have to check that it will not cause overflow.

Maybe it would be better to just implement the very restricted special case of
```
if x { revert(0, 0) }
mstore(0, x)
```
to be reduced to
```
if x { revert(0, 0) }
mstore(0, 0)
```

This would actually even allow the "[promised optimization](https://chriseth.github.io/notes/talks/solidity_optimizer_devcon4/#/20)"

What about extending the current PR with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6252#issuecomment-527141087?

I'm actually not sure if there is so much overlap between the current PR and the idea above.

Also worth to consider: for a function we could collect all call sites, combine the constraints on the used arguments and optimize the function with those constraints on its arguments.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
