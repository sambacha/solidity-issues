Paraphrasing what he said.

"The documentation could do with clear and factual information on the solidity assembly output structure. Currently 3rd parties have some mentions on this and EVM bytecode, but we should have our own 'official' content."

Somewhat connected with a handful of other issues on output in various formats, so possibly a documentation "outputs" project.

No longer needed as moving to different outputs
