Fixes #6265.
~~Depends on #6300.~~

Mainly lacking all kinds of tests.

~~Ah, no, this is still pretty wrong for dynamically sized base types.~~ Should be better now, but still lacking more test.

~~TODO: clarify the situation with external function types and test them thoroughly.~~
Not sure about "thoroughly", but has a test now.

I'd consider the spelling test failure a bug.
I think I'm finally getting somewhere - this still needs more tests, but I'm getting more confident, that it now works...
However, I'm not sure how to make it easier to review...

I split it up into 8 individual commits, each of which should work as a standalone change - I think this way it should be readable. We could split some of them out in separate PRs, though.

Ah, damn, never ending issues :-). Apparently no homestead support for the tests (returning dynamic non-storage arrays) and encoding gas costs increased... is the gas cost test using the optimizer? Then I'd have expected no impact at all - I'll look into it...

Ah Ok! The gas costs stay the same for the optimized version! For the unoptimized case it is to be expected that the cost increases due to the extracted index access function (which will always be inlined for the non-calldata-case) and a few more local variables...

Adjusted the unoptimized gas costs and disabled the incompatible tests for homestead (by rebasing on top of #6300; since it's code generation for the encoding functions is the same for all EVM versions anyways I see no harm in skipping homestead tests).

Needs to be rebased, after #6300 is finalized - but since it's independent changes it should be a smooth rebase.

Also note that github messed up the order of the commits, probably due to some rebasing and squashing (I wonder why they don't just always use the actual commit order in general...).
In particular: ``Implement ABI encoding of calldata arrays and structs.`` is the last one and comes *after* the refactoring commits.

Getting a lot of random and probably unrelated IPC test failures right now...

Note that the last commit (using subOptions for getting correct values for ``numVariablesForType``) is crucial and should arguably be squashed into the respective commits - I kept it separate for review, though. It became necessary due to the slightly different implementation of ``numVariablesForType`` in its extracted PR.

Last commit looks good! Might a similar adjustment be needed for structs, too?

Is there something special about this PR or have the random RPC failures in the test runs increased recently?

The remaining test failure is due to the RPC instability, so this should still be fine!
