# [\#6267 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6267) `closed`: Subranges for calldata arrays.

Calldata arrays should support accessing subranges e.g. ``msg.data.subrange(4)``, resp. ``msg.data.subrange(4, 4+32)``, etc.

This would fix issue #6012 and has interactions with #6220.

We could restrict that to `bytes calldata` for now.

Would also suggest to use `.slice`.

I'm fine with ``.slice`` instead of ``.subrange``, but I think it's not necessary to restrict to ``bytes calldata`` - it's straightforward for any base type, even for dynamically encoded arrays.

Should we overload ``.slice``, as in ``array.slice(begin)`` = ``array.slice(begin, array.length - begin)`` or should we let the user do that?

Or more generally: should the signature be ``slice(begin,length_of_slice)`` or ``slice(begin,end)``?
