Blocked by #7779.
(@ekpyron:) Note: this probably involves https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8291

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4260.
Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6444.
Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8974

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7739. (Does it close it completely?)

### Description

The initial goal was to improve the error message for mappings being used outside storage:
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract C {
    struct T { mapping(uint => uint) a; }
    struct S { T[][2] b; }
    function f(S memory) public {}
}
// ----
// Warning: (0-33): Experimental features are turned on. Do not use experimental features on live deployments.
// TypeError: (132-140): Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public or external functions.
```
### To discuss

The current change to the type system would signal an error for this now:

```
contract Test {
    struct S { uint8 a; mapping(uint => uint) b; uint8 c; }
    S s;
    function f() public returns (uint) {
        S memory x;
        return x.a;
    }
}
// ----
// TypeError: (104-114): Type struct Test.S memory is only valid in storage. Mappings cannot live outside storage.
```

-----

TODO
1. [ ] Recursive structs
2. [ ] Dynamic array of mapping.

Tests still failing - might be fixed by a rebase or might be related to the changes to ``calldataEncodedSize`` et al a while back...

The implementation is done, but it's now blocked by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7779.

@leonardoalt @Marenz  Do you know what should be done with this? The blocked issue is gone now.

@hrkrshnn I'm not sure I get the question. This PR disallows `mapping` to be used outside storage, for example, in a memory struct.

@leonardoalt I mean, can this be merged if the conflicts are resolved? This looks abandoned right now.

spelling failure

@chriseth I'll squash the commits after the review. The spelling check needs merging develop to breaking. Maybe this can be skipped if it's not required for a merge.

I'm still checking, but I'm pretty sure that all uses of `canLiveOutsideStorage` can / should be replaced by a check for `containsMapping` and potentially an assertion about `nameable`. I will create a PR with inline comments.

Here is the pull request: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9090

It would be great if we could partly backport the "containsMapping" property and apply it to develop at all places that are not about skipping mappings when copying.

Replaced by (more or less) #9146
