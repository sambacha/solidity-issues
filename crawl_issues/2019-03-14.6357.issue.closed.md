# [\#6357 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6357) `closed`: homebrew provides commits rather than official `solc` versions

Hi There,

I've noticed that when installing from `brew`, Solidity installs specific commits rather than the official well-formatted versions. For example, right now:

```bash
solc --version
#  Version: 0.5.5+commit.47a71e8f.Darwin.appleclang
````

This in turn, makes the `solc`installations incompatible with libraries like `py-solc-x` which expect to use the official release versions.

What do you mean exactly?

The release Linux build is the following:
```
Version: 0.5.5+commit.47a71e8f.Linux.g++
```

And the Emscripten build:
```
    {
      "path": "soljson-v0.5.5+commit.47a71e8f.js",
      "version": "0.5.5",
      "build": "commit.47a71e8f",
      "longVersion": "0.5.5+commit.47a71e8f",
      "keccak256": "0x7dab358bfe745766bf640e78799beb84646a856717b773eb36c08d274f24fd21",
      "urls": [
        "bzzr://b1d6cee21ac31939a391b84c465160725699c5baf3b7ab74f27f45ecc91387ad"
      ]
},
```

Do you expect that `solc-version` would only return `0.5.5`?

Yep - ‘py-solc-x’ depended on that exact assumption. I’ve realised they’re probably in the wrong here not ‘solc’ itself and have moved to another wrapper!

Any non-release (developer version or nightly) would have a tag after a dash (`-`), such as `0.5.7-develop` or `0.5.7-nightly`.

The tags after the `+` sign are just informational.

Can we close this then?

Absolutely - thanks a lot.
