# [\#6300 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6300) `merged`: Support EVM Version rules for extracted tests.

This is not perfect, but we have to start somewhere.
In extracted tests this will allow the first lines to be comments of the form
```
// EVMVersion: >homestead
// EVMVersion: !byzantium
// EVMVersion: <petersburg
// EVMVersion: =contantinople
```

This will be matched against the current EVM version set for the tests one by one. The test will skipped, if any check fails.

Also adds an ``--evm-version`` argument to ``isoltest``.

Fixes #4262, although it won't support multiple expectations with differing EVM versions, which I suggest to postpone further until syntax and semantics tests are structurally merged.

Reasoning for keeping it on top of the file for now:
So far it is a global setting for the whole test file. At a later point we may want to support multiple expectation blocks each with differing evm version requirements. At that point we can either disallow the specification on top and entirely move to the expectations or keep "global requirements" on top that hold for every block of expectations. In any case I think it's reasonable to have them on the top for now.

Should be squashed after review.
