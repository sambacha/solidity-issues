Currently, isoltest will highlight the whole list of expected return values, if any of them mismatches in any way. It would be much nicer, if it only highlighted exactly those values, that actually mismatch.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
