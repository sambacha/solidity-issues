## Abstract

It would be nice to have support for string and hex literals so that we can generate code such as 
let x := "hello"
let y := 0x1234

This issue tracks support for this.

## Motivation

- Extend current proto specification for the said literals
- Keep in mind that string and hex literals are bounded
  - Max hex character length is 64
  - Max string literal length is 32

For the latter, see

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/834c23fc38f4212a30018cab0414db9323886f5d/test/libsolidity/InlineAssembly.cpp#L658-L661

## Specification

The technical spec. mirrors [yul grammar](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/yul.html)
