# [\#6314 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6314) `closed`: [WIP][RFC] Possible fix for Overload resolution for .value()

This is experimental code that attempts to solve issue #526

Basically, when faced with a non-unique overload situation, we remember all
possible declaration and just pick the first one. If at any point later we
encounter an error, we just retry with the next in the list.

This code is of course not merge ready, instead it wants to demonstrate the
concept and gather feedback.

chris mentioned in the chat that he'd rather take the "explicit" route, though it remains unclear to me what exactly that means.

Ah, I might have confused it with a similar issue. I just fear that this will generate quite some confusion. Would it be possible to only apply this to the `value` and `gas` functions?

Confusion for the user or for us when reading the code?
I mean, sure we can check the name and error out otherwise .. but why not have a more general case to resolve ambigious overloads?

Confusion for both. I think the current backtracking approach is confusing for developers but I'm also not sure about the implications for how to use language. Still, please keep this open - I will take a deeper look later.

I don't think it is a good idea to go back to the contract level and re-try. Closing this for now.

I previously went only as high as needed, which was I think the function call level. But then other cases showed up that benefited from it so I figured I could move it even higher and catch more cases.
