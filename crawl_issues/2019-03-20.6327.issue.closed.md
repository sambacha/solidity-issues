## Description
I have a .sol file which the version is "pragma solidity ^0.4.15;" , and i download the 0.4.15 version
 solc here(https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases?after=v0.4.16).
Now i get a ERROR:
`MultiSigWallet.sol:1:1: Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.4.15-nightly.2017.8.10+commit.8b45bddb.Windows.msvc - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version`
How can i solve it?
(forgive my poor EnglishXD)

Maybe you can download the version 0.4.16 to have a try. By the way, the latest version is Version 0.5.6, you can have a try.

@Skyge 
Thank you for your reply.
I use 0.4.15 because i found a MultiSignatureWallet.sol which is write in 0.4.15 and I am afraid it will broken if I modify it.
I found a website to generate .abi and .bin file online and get .java file with web3j wrapper.
I have been deployed a smart contract and now I`m testing other function. 
谢谢你的回复~
我用0.4.15是因为我找到的多签钱包的.sol文件是用0.4.15写的，我怕我改了之后用不了了_(:з」∠)_
我找到了一个网站在线编译的 http://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/#version=soljson-v0.4.15+commit.bbb8e64f.js&optimize=true 
已经生成.java文件，deploy上去了，正在测试其他功能。

@Winterlx where exactly did you download the version 0.4.16 from?

Which of the releases there did you use? Which system are you running?

Did you use one of the provided binaries or did you compile yourself?

It looks like this release has an error then. Could you try 0.4.16? I think you should really use 0.4.25, though.

I`ll try 0.4.16.
I use 0.4.16 because I have a .sol file programmed with 0.4.15 and I don`t know how to change the .sol file and make it work _(:з」∠)_.
Thank you!

This means it requires at least 0.4.15 but will work with any later 0.4 version.

Just for reference, there was actually an issue with 0.4.15 reporting as nightly on Windows. It's been reported in #9545 and we're going to rebuild and update the binary on the release page.
