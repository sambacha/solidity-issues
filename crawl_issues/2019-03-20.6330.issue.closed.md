This is in reference to PR #6322, where we provide better exception diagnostics.

Now, the plan is to properly catch invalid arguments to those assembly functions by catching them earlier, i.e. in the AsmAnalysis.

For that to work, AsmAnalysis needs to know about assembly objects (structure).

Passing an invalid argument should then report to `ErrorReporter` as a `TypeError` (?).

Can you explain what is the problem here? We seem to have a check in `AsmAnalysis` for finding unknown object cases (errorcode 3517).

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
