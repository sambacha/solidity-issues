With the AbiEncoderv2, is the intent to have structs returned from auto-generated getters for public storage?

For example,

```
struct Data {
    uint256 x;
    bytes32 y;
}

mapping (bytes32 => Data) public data;
```

This exposes the getter `function data(bytes32) public view returns (uint256,bytes32)`

Is it possible that it could instead expose `function data(bytes32) public view returns (Data)`?

I think you can not only get a struct type from a function with the [ABIEncoderV2](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.6/abi-spec.html#handling-tuple-types), but pass a struct type into a function.

The automatic getters were designed before structs in the ABI were even considered. Especially for arrays, getters as they currently are make sense in certain cases, so I'm a bit reluctant in changing the behaviour altogether. We could change the detail about returning structs once ABIEncoderV2 is the default, though. I would not change it earlier because activating ABIEncoderV2 currently does not silently change the external behaviour of contracts.

Any plans to support this?

No plans so far but I agree that we should start finally thinking about changing it. Maybe 0.9.0 would be a good moment to take care of it.

The way this works currently is really unintuitive, especially combined with overriding. It was brought up in #11826 some time ago. For example to be able to override a getter defined in an interface with an actual getter you need an extra wrapper:

```solidity
interface I {
    struct S { uint a; }
    function s() external returns (S memory);
}

contract C is I {
    struct WrappedS { S s; }
    WrappedS public override s;
}
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
