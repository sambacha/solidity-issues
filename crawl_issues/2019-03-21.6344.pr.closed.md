# [\#6344 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6344) `closed`: [Yul] Value Constraint Based Simplifier.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-03-21 15:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6344):

Implements part of #6252 

This implements value range tracking on variables but is horribly complicated. It solves a problem the old optimizer was not able to solve, for example:

```
let size := and(calldatasize(), 0xff)
if lt(size, 0x100) { ... }
```

is reduced to 

```
let size := and(calldatasize(), 0xff)
if 1 { ... }
```


Still, it can only handle static bounds and injecting information in branches is also not yet implemented. Perhaps we need a completely new strategy for the following example, that would then also make this complicated solution obsolete?

This can not yet be reduced:
```
let size := and(calldatasize(), 0xff)
for { let i := 0 } lt(i, size) { i := add(i, 1) }
{
  if gt(i, 0x500) { revert(0, 0) }
}
```

This still needs extensive tests.

Summary of RL discussion:

1. `bitsFromValue`: you can flip bits between highest and lowest in `maxValue` and still be in range. Therefore `maxBits` needs to be set in [highest, 0] and `minBits` needs to be unset in `[highest, 0]` in the worst case. An optimization is to keep the common prefix (if it exists) between `maxValue` and `minValue`, set the rest of the bits in `maxValue`, unset the rest of the bits in `minValue`.

2. `valueFromBits`: in this case you can't get values that are greater than `maxBits` or smaller than `minBits` by flipping bits, so `maxValue = maxBits`, `minValue = minBits` works.

I think it now needs the EVM version in the test file.

I haven't read the PR, yet, but in light of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/5815#discussion_r271375117 - will this be able to deduce range constraints based on the fact that their violation will lead to a code path that always reverts? E.g. optimize
```
if someRangeCondition(x) { revert(0,0) }
if invertedRangeCondition(x) { ...do sth... }
if someRangeCondition(x) { ...do sth else... }
```
to
```
if someRangeCondition(x) { revert(0,0) }
if 1 { ...do sth... }
if 0 { ...do sth else... }
```
?
I think that might be quite important in the end.

EDIT: sorry - that's in fact already here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6252#issuecomment-472364090

@ekpyron this PR does not learn from branch conditions yet, but what you mention is listen in the issue, yes.
