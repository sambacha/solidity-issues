See https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/pull/221#discussion_r266425192

Also optionally fix this issue with 0.4.26.

Was this fixed or just removed from 0.4.26?

I do not remember.

Here's something related: tests on solc versions < 0.6.0 require boost < 1.71.0 to pass. That's because boost 1.71.0 fixed `boost::multiprecision` to respect `std::uppercase` when written to a stream as a hexadecimal number (https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/pull/130, https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision/issues/129). Earlier boost versions were hard-coded to print hex numbers in uppercase.

Some of our tests relied on that bug - e.g. in solc 0.5.0 test case `Assembler/all_assembly_items` fails . In solc 0.5.13 most of our code was changed to use `std::uppercase` (#7567) but the one affecting that test case seems to have only been included in solc 0.6.0 (#7619, not sure why, maybe it was only included in `breaking`?).

As for solc 0.4.x, I needed boost older than 1.70.0 to build solc 0.4.0 on MacOS 10.15 (Github Actions) because of this error:
```c++
/Users/runner/work/solc-bin/solc-bin/solidity/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp:223:74: error: no matching conversion for functional-style cast from 'const dev::u256' (aka 'const number<boost::multiprecision::cpp_int_backend<256, 256, boost::multiprecision::unsigned_magnitude, boost::multiprecision::unchecked, void> >') to 'std::__1::string' (aka 'basic_string<char, char_traits<char>, allocator<char> >')
                                        createJsonValue("PUSH [tag]", i.location().start, i.location().end, string(i.data())));
                                                                                                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
`i.data()` returns `u256` (i.e. a specialization of `boost::multiprecision`) and apparently it's convertible to `string` only in older boost versions. For me specifically boost 1.63.0 worked for this specific error (though I'm still getting other, unrelated errors). I haven't tried any versions in between yet.

I'm pretty sure that the problem to investigate here (not being able to build 0.4.x with boost 1.69.0 and having to downgrade it to 1.60.0) is what I described in my comment above.
- boost 1.70.0 fails due to the problem with `multiprecision` described above.
- boost 1.65.0 works with all solidity versions between 0.3.6 and 0.6.8. Most likely with newer too.
- For many solidity versions boost 1.63.0 works too, though I don't remember if I tried it specifically with 0.4.26. It worked with at least some 0.4.x versions. I switched to boost 1.65.0 at some point.
- I was not able to try anything below that. boost 1.60.0 cannot be installed directly from homebrew core any more (`Error: boost@1.60 has been disabled because it is a versioned formula!`) and when checking out the formula from an earlier revision it fails too because it depended on something that has been moved/removed. I was only able to build versions 1.63.0 and up.

Also note that solc versions below 0.5.0 were not using boost unit test properly which results in `duplicate symbol` errors when linking (#3845). It was fixed in #4572 and the fix can be easily backported to earlier versions. I think affects all boost versions though.

@chriseth @axic is there anything more to investigate or should we close this issue?

I don't think it is important if we can point users to macos builds.

OK. I'm closing it in that case. I think the info above should be sufficient if someone wants to revisit it.
