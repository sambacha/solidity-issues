https://github.com/dexon-foundation/dsolidity

The only addition they seem to have is support for a new opcode, `RAND`.

Seems to have moved to https://github.com/dexon-foundation/ace-mode-dsolidity (or https://github.com/raphaelhuefner/ace-mode-solidity). Also, looks abandoned (no new commits since 2018).

ace-mode is syntax highlighting tool, so I'd say they just made the repo private or deleted it.

Ah, sorry. I should have taken a better look at it before posting :)

Anyway, the repo is gone and the only trace is a stub in their docs: https://dexon-foundation.github.io/wiki/dsolidity.html. All public activity in organization's 42 repositories seems to have stopped a year ago. The [last activity on their gitter channel from nov 2019 is people saying it's dead](https://gitter.im/dexon-foundation/Lobby?at=5da834972d59854e7f1abb84). I think we can close this one.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
