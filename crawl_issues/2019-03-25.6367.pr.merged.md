This turns out to be much bigger impact, all the tests are made with the assumption that warnings are errors. I'll remove the second commit from here, the first commit is still useful.

Will create another PR which adds the warning in StandardCompiler and not in AssemblyStack.

We can properly fix it in the next release.
