# [\#6387 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6387) `closed`: Implement code generation routines for break/continue statements

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-03-26 14:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6387):

## Abstract

This is a blocker for fuzz testing optimization routines for the newly introduced break/continue statements inside for loop bodies (#6136 and #6315 ).

## Motivation

The problem seems to that the Stack compressor depends on the Code Transformer that does not yet support break/continue statements and signals this by throwing an assertion.
