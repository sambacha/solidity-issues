# [\#6413 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6413) `merged`: Add CI to build ossfuzz fuzzer binaries

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-03-28 22:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6413):

(closes #5829 )

Notes
  - only verifies ossfuzz build
  - does not replicate ossfuzz environment. Deviations are
     - link against libstdc++ instead of libc++
     - don't compile libFuzzingEngine.a with ASan instead of with
  - this may or may not be relevant but retaining it for posterity/future use

In addition to adding a full compilation step to circleci, I wonder whether it might be a good idea to single out everything in the libfuzzer directory that does not depend on protobuf or libfuzzer so that it is actually compiled also on our development machines without external dependencies.

Most of the fuzzing code is actually just running the yul compiler, running the interpreter, etc. and does not have any other external dependencies. This can all be put into fuzzer_common.h/cpp

@chriseth Splitting ossfuzz code into external code dependent and independent definitely makes sense. Isn't it a new issue though? This PR only closes #5829 so that there is some indication of changes to solidity code that break the ossfuzz harnesses at the CI stage.
