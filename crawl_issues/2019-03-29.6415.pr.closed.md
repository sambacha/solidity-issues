#### Add information about how to build from source

Directly using git repository or zip file provided by github to build can encounter this error on Ununtu 18.04: `Z3Interface.cpp:166:14: error: ‘mod’ is not a member of ‘z3’`

Guidance about cloning git repository is provided above so it is misleading and may make many people directly use the git repository to build.

Therefore, additional information is added in the front of section **Command-Line Build** to remind people to use the solidity.tar.gz file provided in release page.

@Troublor thanks for the contribution, but I also think that's unrelated.
It looks like the problem you encountered is related to the Z3 version (Solidity uses Z3 4.6+).
I checked and the "Installing from source" section in the documentation is actually wrong, so I opened https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6434 to fix it.

 Thanks @chriseth, it is true that my comment only applies to release build. 
@leonardoalt I have checked my Z3 version and it's 4.8.0 - 64 bit. I have opened an issuse #6436 to talk about my problem.
