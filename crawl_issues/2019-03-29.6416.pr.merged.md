I had pylint installed and it did some formatting fixes, can undo those if not welcome

@chriseth Further tidying with respect to comments from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6427

solhint has a quiet mode, but it's not very good. It still prints a blank line, but I'll log an issue with them and for no, hopefully this is OK for us.

Hmm, obviously this is because a dependency is missing, but this raises a question for me.

As the dependency is a node module, which also requires Node installed. A CI system likely does and we can just install the module. But a user _might_ not, though probably does.

I'm thinking that this test should be extracted a test that people can run by setting or unsetting a parameter (like many of the other tests), and then mention in the docs, that running the test requires node, and if it is selected, then install the NPM module.

Does that make sense? Thoughts?

Done @chriseth but what about the comment above? We haven't really addressed the dependency issue yet.

I would suggest the following:
 - install solhint on the CI that runs the test
 - only execute the solhint line if solhint is available, otherwise print a warning but do not fail the test.

@chriseth OK, that's a good idea, but now it opens another question for me, and helps me understand the decisions behind our test strategy a bit more.

I created this test in the CLI tests, not for CI tests, so it might make more sense to break the test out into a seperate file so it can be reused for CLI tests and as a CI test? And then implement your suggestions above?

OK, @chriseth I think this is finally ready. I wanted to seperate things as this test is less important than others and didn't really want it reliant on on other more important tests, and needed time to break it out.

The tests in this PR will fail as the style fixes happened in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6427 but either way, this test failing shouldn't break a build, more advisory.

Will tweak over time, and also add to docs.

Rebased, but there are new violations to the style guide introduced after this PR that I am fixing.

Yeah, this has sat here a while @leonardoalt I'll rebase, but the only test failing is the one this introduces which should be fixed by a rebase.

OK added an ignore step to ignore the contributors guide, as it features syntax that breaks the checker.

@chriseth Squashed, and addressed comments, sorry some things I read said the brackets were needed when using break and exit, obviously that was wrong.
