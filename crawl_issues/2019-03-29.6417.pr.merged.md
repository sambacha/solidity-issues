# [\#6417 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6417) `merged`: Type System API refactor

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-03-29 13:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6417):

### The Problem
We could create Solidity source code that caused the solidity compiler to leak memory due to circular dependencies in the type system and no clear ownership.

### The Motivation
With the aim for zero memory leaks I propose to create an API that
* provides clear ownership
* unified way of requesting for types.
* potentially internal optimizations by reusing types or having no heap allocation at all.
* fixes #4517

Implicitly we found out that we can get rid of `shared_ptr<>` and its `shared_from_this()`, overall making the related code look more clear.

### Implementation
The API for requesting/providing types is called `TypeProvider` and lives in `libsolidity/ast/`. It was attempted to keep the changes to all the type accessing code at a minimum, i.e. there were places that I would have written differently (such as how to you access the type provider?), but those should be done in a follow-up PR.

### Notes
* Currently the type provider is accessed via singleton pattern, a follow-up PR should change that. (not included here to keep changes to a minimum!).
* `TypePointer`, `TypePointers`, `FunctionTypePointer` are defined in many places. should be unified (isolated PR)
* I personally don't think the type system should know about the AST / syntax, but currently it does need that information. I'd favor abstracting that part away to keep isolation clean (and avoid circular API layer dependencies) - opinions, @chriseth?
* The type system also implements evaluation via `unaryOperatorResult()` and `binaryOperatorResult()`. I am not quite sure it should be mixed up (if changing at all, then in another PR of course). Objections?
* running soltest/isoltest with `CXXFLAGS=-fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer` (yields no errors but without it does(?)).

p.s.: this branch is yet to be squashed when considered ready.

That's great news! I wonder whether removing the singleton is really necessary. In the end, this is a memory management class...

Just out of curiosity: If this is done properly and reliably everywhere, we could implement ``Type::operator==`` simply as
``bool Type::operator==(Type const& _other) const { return this == &_other; }``, right? Or would that be invalid/undefined due to the types being polymorphic anyways? I'm not entirely sure :-). There shouldn't be two instances of types comparing as equal, though, should there?

@ekpyron that was also my initial thought of having that implicit benefit. But currently we still allow type instanciation outsite `TypeProvider`. With that being prohibited **and** having made sure that `TypeProvider` returns the same type for the same input data, then it would be a simple pointer comparison (or am I missing something?).
p.s.: such a guarantee could be implemented in a later PR.

I think it is safer to compare by contents - I don't expect too much gain from comparing by pointer.

Actually, I'm still not entirely convinced by this concept.
Which parts of the types have to be reset at all? Is there anything else than the member lists? They depend on the ``ContractDefinition`` and IMO should thus be moved there (in a map from types to member lists) - only the ``ContractDefinition const* = nullptr`` case should be in the type and that remains constant anyways.

If there's no other case, then this means that now all types can be singleton themselves, which means one can make constructors private and have static creation function in each of them, which will immediately prevent "stray types" (like we had to track them down for hours in this PR ;-)).

And if one worries about memory usage after compiling multiple contracts one can still add ``clearTypeCache`` functions to the potentially "large" types, i.e. the reference types. (EDIT: and maybe tuple types; such clearing would need to be done very carefully, since no references to cleared types should remain, but that's not more dangerous than the current clearing and it'd not be necessary in the first step (or maybe even not ever) anyways).

I think this would both be cleaner and safer and in fact mean less invasive code changes.

So @christianparpart, unless you have a compelling argument against that and for the approach of this PR I'd rather suggest to do it that way, sorry ;-).

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2019-04-04 09:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6417#issuecomment-479818588):

So the alternative proposal would be:

- move the member lists from the types to ``ContractDefinition`` (resp. it's annotation). Then all types should remain globally valid for the entire lifetime of the compiler (to be verified!).
- make the constructors of all types private
- have a static list/map of already created types of that kind in each type with constructors (either as static members of the type or locally static in the creation function, see next point)
- have static creation functions in each type that will check whether a matching type was already created and return it, or create a new one and store it

This way management of particular types will remain local to the respective type (which IMO increases maintainability) and each type is created only once and never destroyed.

The only argument against that would be ever increasing memory usage in long-living compilers. This can still be addressed in a separate step, though, either by clearing the type lists in each type separately or by moving the lookup and storage logic for already created types *only* to a type provider class (as opposed to the whole creation and management logic).

I'm not a big fan of moving the member lists out of the type system into the AST, since the members are not a feature of the AST. Also I'm not sure if checking whether a type has been created already or not is a good idea - then the equality checks have to be really strict and correct. Furthermore, what is the big benefit?

The member list *is* a feature of the AST IMO (at least the library imported part of it)... The "native members" can still live in the types themselves, but since the library imported members in fact depend on the AST node and not on the type, I'd manage that there (so have a type->nonNativeMember map in ContractDefinition instead of a ContractDefinition->nonNativeMember map in the type).
Actually, since in my proposal all types live forever anyways, we could in fact keep it the way it is - I think it's only a problem due to the clearing in the Type Provider. Still I think it should be moved.

Checking whether a type was already created obviously saves memory in the long run, but it's optional in both this PR and my proposal. Shouldn't the equality checks be strict and correct anyways? But yeah - in both proposals we can first just always create a new type and think about saving memory later.

For example ``[address].send`` is native to the type. It's always there independently of where the address occurs. Given ``using L for address;`` all these library functions are non-native to the type - they are only there, if the address is used in scope of the "using".
``[address].send`` could remain in the type, but the additional members stemming from library imports should be managed in the contract definitions, i.e. the scopes of the using definitions.

Ok, I see. So this is only about the `using x for y` statements, right? The non-native members would depend on the context and the type. I think it would be OK to store that in the annotations, but the problem is that this is a potentially unbounded container which would rather pollute the annotations. 

Perhaps it would make sense to create a class specifically for that purpose that just serves as a cache and is reset at regular intervals?

@chriseth Is it better to pollute the types instead of the AST node annotations (which is what's currently happening) :-)? But yeah - we could have a dedicated cache for the member lists that can be cleared.

In any case: the main question is whether we want to stay with the TypeProvider construction as currently done in this PR or whether we want to let the Types manage themselves as I suggested. I'm not strongly against the current TypeProvider construction, but I'd prefer it the other way.

Yeah, I agree - factory functions inside the types themselves certainly allow for more local changes.

What do we do about RationalNumberType?

``RationalNumberType``s are a bit of a problem either way (unless we're fine with keeping them alive, although they're only used once or so)... Not sure how best to deal with them.

This sounds like we need a singleton cache that can be reset from the compiler stack :)

If we only reset in the compiler stack, then we can just reset the singleton in ``RationalNumberType`` itself :-) - I was wondering if we need to keep the ``RationalNumberType``s alive even that long (I could imagine that a lot of them could be very short-lived, but I'd need to check).

A singleton container that can be reset could be very simple, if we don't want to check, whether an identical type was already created, but always create new ones anyways, e.g.:

```
class TypeContainer {
public:
    template<typename T>
    T *storeType(std::unique_ptr<T>&& _type) {
        T* ptr = _type.get();
        m_types.emplace_back(std::move(_type));
        return ptr;
    }
    void reset() { m_types.clear(); }
    static TypeContainer& get() {
        static TypeContainer container;
        return container;
    }
private:
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Type>> m_types;
}
// In Types.h/cpp
class SomeType {
public:
    template<typename... Args>
    static SomeType *someType(Args... args) {
        return TypeContainer::get().storeType(std::make_unique<SomeType>(std::forward<Args>(args)...));
    }
private:
    SomeType(SomeArgs... args) { ... }
};
```
And that could still be extended with equality checks later on, while keeping the creation logic in the types...

But yeah - whether we have all creation functions grouped together in a separate class or keep them in each Type itself is mostly a question of taste in the end - so I'm fine with keeping it as it is as well, especially since that's already implemented here.

The critical thing is that ownership should be clear. Types are stored as pointers and the lifetime of these pointers has to be bounded by calls to reset - at least for everything that is not just a cache. The members might be just a cache if they do not store types themselves. Every type that is not "static", like RationalNumberType has to have clear ownership and lifetime, and I think that can only be provided by the CompilerStack.

Actually, to me it looks like two cases then: If it's feasible - instead of a singleton that is reset from ``CompilerStack`` - to make ``TypeProvider`` an actual member of ``CompilerStack``, I'd say that's preferrable and would vote for basically keeping things as they are (we can try mitigating code duplication, resp. spread later with some template tricks).
If having ``TypeProvider`` be a member results in too much hassle in passing it around everywhere and we would end up keeping it a singleton, then I would change it to just be a thin (singleton) ``TypeContainer`` as in my comment above and have the creation functions statically in the types themselves for increased locality.
