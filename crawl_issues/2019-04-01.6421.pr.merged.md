# [\#6421 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6421) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Refactor VariableUsage

Fixes #5903 

The previous `VariableUsage` class pre-processed the AST in its constructor to keep only paths to nodes that touched variables. When adding support to modifier inlining, it got too complicated to keep the state and know what's happening when a `PlaceholderStatement` is visited.
This PR refactors `VariableUsage` as a simple visitor that inlines function calls and modifiers following the same rules as the SMTChecker. It is of course slower than the previous `VariableUsage`, but less complicated to deal with (in my opinion).

The added tests were leading to ICEs due to the latest PR on `VariableUsage` that added function call inlining. This PR also fixes that. The tests were simplified versions of `rubixi.sol` from #5903.

Maybe a future refactor can be done where the class `SMTChecker` derives from `VariableUsage` and we can use shared visitor functions.
