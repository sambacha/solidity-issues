# [\#6429 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6429) `merged`: Add settings framework for interactive tests.

The architecture is still not the best - `parseSourceAndSettings` is not always called, but the mechanism used for `viableForCurrentEnvironment` (which is always called) kind of expect this to be done. It all works, but it might not fail correctly if there are invalid settings.

On a second glance I think the windows test failures might be spurious and due to AppVeyor running the tests on a wrong commit or something like that again? The output looks very much like it's the old test files...

However, #6425 has the same test failures - I never really got why it sometimes happens that AppVeyor tests run on a wrong branch or whatever happens there...

It looks like appveyor did not check out the files correctly, since the expectations still have the old step header.

Updated (changed the wording on the error message).

Tests seem to be fine. I will merge - can make changes tomorrow if you still have comments, @ekpyron

@chriseth Ok, I think it's fine - I expect this to be touched again soon anyways, once we start supporting multiple expectation blocks per test case, resp. test source file.
