Many interactive tests share common functionality and functionslike `printIndented`. They should be pulled into a common base class.

Also, a "simple" interactive test that just has an input and an output (and comparison is string comparison) could profit from a simple combined base class.

It might even make sense to combine this with allowing multiple expectation blocks per test already - then a common class would split the input into source and multiple expectation blocks, determine which kind of test each expectation block is (and parse common settings) and then let the specific test case handle the rest.

@ekpyron I think we should first clean up the mess and then make it more complicated again :)

I think *really* cleaning it up would basically mean rewriting quite some parts of it and then one might as well split into multiple expectation blocks right away, since otherwise we'll probably rewrite things once more later on anyways :-). But yeah - both would be fine and I would say whoever actually does this can decide which seems better and easier.

I would like to work on it. I have some experience in C++. This seems to look like something interesting to work on.

One piece of code you could look out for is
```
	if (m_expectation != m_obtainedResult)
	{
		string nextIndentLevel = _linePrefix + "  ";
		AnsiColorized(_stream, _formatted, {formatting::BOLD, formatting::CYAN}) << _linePrefix << "Expected result:" << endl;
		printIndented(_stream, m_expectation, nextIndentLevel);
		AnsiColorized(_stream, _formatted, {formatting::BOLD, formatting::CYAN}) << _linePrefix << "Obtained result:" << endl;
		printIndented(_stream, m_obtainedResult, nextIndentLevel);
		return TestResult::Failure;
	}
```

This is shared in quite some files. Especially if `m_expectation` and `m_obtainedResult` is a string, it can be pulled into a common base class, which could be named something like `SimpleTestCase` that itself inherits from `TestCase`.

I think I don't need help as of now. Do you guys have an IRC?

Is this issue still open? I'm trying to find good first issues to start contributing to open source.

 I believe ppl not part of the team can't assign issues. Just let us now if that is the case and we'll assign it for you.

I think after #9059 this looks good now!
