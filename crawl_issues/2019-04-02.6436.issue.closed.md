## Description
I tried to build solidity from source code with the latest version. I followed the instructions in [Solidity Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source), but I ran into an error when execute: `cmake .. && make`. The cmake error is as follows:
```
-- boost version: 106501
-- boost headers: /usr/include
-- boost lib   : /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_regex.a;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_filesystem.a;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_unit_test_framework.a;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_program_options.a;/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_system.a

```

My Z3 version is 4.8.0 - 64 bit and I'm using Ubuntu 18.04
I also tried to build with the solidity_0.5.7.tar.gz in the [release page](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) and it's the same problem.

That is weird. If `cmake` said it found Z3 than the version should be correct. I also have 4.8.0 - 64 bit on Linux.
I'm guessing you installed Z3 4.8.0 manually, since Ubuntu still distributes Z3 4.4.
Can you please open `CMakeCache.txt` and check variables `Z3_EXECUTABLE`, `Z3_INCLUDE_DIR` and `Z3_LIBRARY`? It could be that you have multiple versions installed and there's some confusion going on the cmake side.

@leonardoalt Thanks for your help!  
I did install Z3 4.8.0 manually. Z3_INCLUDE_DIR does have a problem. After I move head files in `z3/include` to `/usr/include`, it works. Thank you. 
```
//Path to a program.
Z3_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/my/path/to/z3-4.8.4.d6df51951f4c-x64-ubuntu-16.04/bin/z3

//Path to a file.
Z3_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/include

//Path to a library.
Z3_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/my/path/to/z3-4.8.4.d6df51951f4c-x64-ubuntu-16.04/bin/libz3.so

I am facing same issue. I just pulled new changes and didn't install anything.

My CMakeCache.txt says
```
//Path to a program.
Z3_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=Z3_EXECUTABLE-NOTFOUND

//Path to a file.
Z3_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=/usr/include

//Path to a library.
[Z3_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz3.so`]
```

@leonardoalt , any idea?

@anurag-git The build system also needs the z3 executable in this case, in order to check the version. It looks like in your case it couldn't find it. This is indeed a new requirement that wasn't there before.
Could you please check that you have the executable installed?

I do have the same misconfiguration problem when using Ubuntu 18 on ARM (armv7l) device. Is there a final solution to this issue?

@zerjioang so far we've encountered no issues on the build system side.
In @anurag-git 's case it looks like the executable is not installed.
Can you please open `CMakeCache.txt` and check variables `Z3_EXECUTABLE`, `Z3_INCLUDE_DIR` and `Z3_LIBRARY`?

@leonardoalt my Z3 installer was missing, I just install it with apt and everything was fine. I thought it was automatically installed after running install_deps script

Ok, good!
I'll close the issue then.
@anurag-git please re-open if it still doesn't work for you after installing the executable.
