# [\#6445 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6445) `merged`: Implemented copying recursive structs from storage to memory.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6374.

Should we catch this (and the opposite case of copying from memory to storage) in the TypeChecker instead? It'd make it easier to test this :-).

Could example in #6374  be added to this PR as a test case?

Was this bug introduced at some point, i.e. did it work before?

@chriseth Just checked 0.4.24 and 0.5.0 and both hang - I don't think there was ever the infrastructure for this to work.
@bshastry This "bugfix" in the current form still throws an unimplemented feature error, i.e. an internal compiler error during code generation - it just doesn't cause the compiler to hang anymore. Unfortunately, so far our syntax tests don't execute code generation at all, so they won't trigger this exception - so the only way would be a commandline test (however, afaik we don't do this for other unimplemented feature errors either)...

In general I'm not sure whether we should try to catch everything that'll throw unimplemented feature errors during code generation already in the type checker - but then we should do this not only for this case, but for the opposite case as well (and probably a whole bunch of other unimplemented feature errors).

Ah, now I see where the actual problem is! I think this might be quite easy to solve using `m_context.callLowLevelFunction` - you can find examples in ArrayUtils where it solves a similar problem, I think.

@chriseth Ok - I'll look into that then!

@chriseth You meant something along the lines of this? You were right, that was much easier than expected...

The other direction - copying from memory to storage - is still unimplemented as well... I wonder whether that's equally straightforward to fix...

Ah ok... the other direction is only implemented for value base types in ArrayUtils so far...
