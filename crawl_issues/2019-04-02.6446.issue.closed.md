## Description

In

```
{
  pop(f())
  function f() -> b { let g := mload(0) b := 0 }
  function g() {}
}
```

At the time, the yul Interpreter encounters the close scope `}` of `f()`, it sees both a variable and a function named "g" that are in scope and deletes them both tripping this assertion

because `erased == 2`

This is a bug in the ScopeFiller where it allows shadowing although it should not be legal.
In `ScopeFiller::operator()(Block const&`, it should first register all functions and only actually visit them later.

Will fix it.
