If a function is called with a constant argument, instead of inlining it, it might be better to create a copy of the function where the parameter is set to a constant and the optimizing this function in isolation (which might lead to recursive calls...). If the resulting function is small enough, keep it, otherwise discard it.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
