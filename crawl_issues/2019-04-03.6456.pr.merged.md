I reran the fuzzer on this patch and it told me that the following assembly code compiles fine, but optimization throws an exception

```
{
        function f(a, b) -> x
        {
                x := x
                {
                         x := f(g(), h())
                }
                let r := f(b, a)
        }
        function g() -> y
        {
                let r := f(g(), h())
        }
        function h() -> z
        {
                mstore(5, 4)
                z := mload(0)
        }
        let r := f(g(), h())
}
```

Assertion is thrown here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/3df4936b6f76426f38129d7a7e57e3c8ac35ddd0/libyul/AsmAnalysis.cpp#L77

The (optimized) code at the time assertion is thrown is the following

```
{
    let z := 0
    let _1 := 4
    let _2 := 5
    mstore(_2, _1)
    let z_1 := mload(z)
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    mstore(_2, _1)
    pop(f(g(), mload(z)))
    pop(f(z_1, z))
    function f(a, b) -> x
    {
        mstore(5, 4)
        x := f(g(), mload(0))
        pop(f(b, a))
    }
    function g() -> y
    {
        mstore(5, 4)
        let z := mload(0)
        let _1 := g()
        mstore(5, 4)
        pop(f(g(), mload(0)))
        pop(f(z, _1))
    }
}
```

I tried to print the errorList at the time this happened and it returned the following text
```
bugs/opt-not-yul.yul:17:3: Error: Variable name z already taken in this scope.
		z := mload(0)
		^-----------^
bugs/opt-not-yul.yul:12:14: Error: Variable name _1 already taken in this scope.
		let r := f(g(), h())
		           ^-^
```

Since the errors don't match either the original source or the optimized source, I don't know what to make of it.

General question: What do scoping rules say about
```
{
  let x := 0
  function f() { x := 1 }
}
```

Is `x` in scope inside `f()`?

Ready for review. Fixed another might-be-bug.

Yes, that should be fixed, now, too @bshastry

The scoping rules were not implemented correctly: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yul.html#scoping-rules

> Shadowing is disallowed, i.e. you cannot declare an identifier at a point where another identifier with the same name is also visible, even if it is not accessible.
> Inside functions, it is not possible to access a variable that was declared outside of that function.

Visible means "defined in the same block as the function (or a common parent block)". Accessible means "visible and reaching to it does not cross function boundaries".

Okay, will rerun the fuzzer on the diff

> Visible means "defined in the same block as the function (or a common parent block)". Accessible means "visible and reaching to it does not cross function boundaries".

So in the previous example (reproducing for convenience)

```
{
  let x := 0
  function f() { x := 1 }
}
```

`x` is visible in `f()` but not accessible, right? Does `accessible` subsume both read and write i.e., inside `f()` one can neither read from nor write to `x`?

Ah, I see why the original test input which is

```
{
  pop(f())
  function f() -> b { let g := mload(0) b := 0 }
  function g() {}
}
```

led to problems. `g()` is accessible inside `f()` so declaring it (albeit as a variable) inside `f()` is disallowed.

Please rebase and squash.

Ah, it's a compilation test failing in both runs (i.e. linux and mac) due to an additional scope...

Which is due to running the function grouper, so it's fine and only the test expectations need to be updated.

Rebased and updated some expectations.
