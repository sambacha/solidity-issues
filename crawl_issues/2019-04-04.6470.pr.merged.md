At the very outside, `afl_fuzzer.cpp` catches exceptions. It reports any exception with the name of the file it is currently run on. If you call `abort()` directly, it has no chance to react.

Hmm... since we used to call abort before this PR, what was the point behind catching exceptions in the `afl_fuzzer.cpp` test harness? I was expecting the try...catch clause to be newly introduced with this PR.

The harness was also meant to catch stray exceptions. Caling `abort()` instead was just a "nice" way to flag a failure without having to think about _which_ type of exception to throw. Since we are running on multiple input files at once now, this is not a "nice" way anymore.

Okay, looks good to me, but it is missing a try...catch clause inside the other two call sites of this function's wrapper `testCompiler`. something like

```
extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(uint8_t const* _data, size_t _size)
{
	if (_size <= 600)
	{
		string input(reinterpret_cast<char const*>(_data), _size);
                try
                {
		      FuzzerUtil::testCompiler(input, /*optimize=*/false, /*quiet=*/true);
                }
                catch (Exception const&)
                {
                     abort();
                }
	}
	return 0;
}
```

and similarly in the other call site.

Approving since I don't see an obvious problem that unhandled exceptions present to libfuzzer.
