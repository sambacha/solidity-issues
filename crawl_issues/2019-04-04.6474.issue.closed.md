## Abstract

Fuzzer regressions are regressions for fuzzer discovered bugs. We can use a new CI to check if a previously discovered bug is not reintroduced by a PR.

## Motivation

At a minimum
  - we store fuzzer binaries created by the build ossfuzz job as artifacts
  - clone the regressions from the solidity-fuzzing-corpus repo
  - run fuzzer binary against all test inputs in the repo

Latency: ~5 minutes
