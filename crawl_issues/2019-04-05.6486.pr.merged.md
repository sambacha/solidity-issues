### Description

I have removed the steps where handling of pre blocks of for loops was done before, instead of that an assert statement is there which checks if a pre block for loops are empty or not.

Fixes #6202 

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing

@chriseth  could you review?
I need help with some tests, you can see i changed `SSATransform` and then i changed the tests `ssaTransform` and it passed but when i changed the for loops in `ssaAndBack` it is giving an error

```
unknown location(0): fatal error: in "yulOptimizerTests/ssaAndBack/for_loop": signal: SIGSEGV, si_code: 0 (memory access violation at address: 0x00000080)
```
A similar thing happens with `ExpressionSplitter` the tests `expressionSplitter` are passing but `expressionSimplifier` are failing with error
```
unknown location(0): fatal error: in "yulOptimizerTests/expressionSimplifier/inside_for": memory access violation at address: 0x7f8d0000001a: no mapping at fault address
```
What does these error means, can't seem to find anything anywhere?

@Marenz  okay, if anyone gets time and can help me a little bit with these tests it'd be great. This is my first contribution to solidity and i can't seem to find the test errors reason anywhere.

So the errors you posted above suggest some memory management problems. I would recommend to run the tests with gdb, that should show you which variable accesses/functions are crashing and from there you can track how the variable is pointing to invalid memory.

Be sure to build with debug symbols before you do this

@Marenz  @ekpyron  FIXED!!

Please add `Prerequisite: ForLoopInitRewriter.` to all optimizer step classes that inherit from DataFlowAnalyzer.

The following components need a note that they depend on the ForLoopInitRewriter:
 - CommonSubexpressionEliminator
 - DataFlowAnalyzer
 - ExpressionSimplifier
 - RedundantAssignEliminator
 - Rematerializer
 - StructuralSimplifier

And in addition to those, of course the ones you modified.

If you are fed up with this issue, we can also finish it for you :)

@chriseth  check it out now, i have added the prerequisites and all the changed tests are run by some class which is dependent on ForLoopInitRewriter so changes are mandatory.

Wonderful, thanks a lot!
