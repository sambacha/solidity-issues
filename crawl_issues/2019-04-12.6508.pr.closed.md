Add ParserBase::expectTokenRecoveryDelete, which is like ParserBase::expectToken
but deletes until the expected token or EOS is seen.

@chriseth @christianparpart : This is my first experiment in recovery. 

```
contract Five {
  function five() returns(int) {
    uint256 a;
    a = 1
      a = 3;
      return 5;
    }
}
```

The above program recovers as expected. 

Unless you have thoughts or comments, instead of extending parser error recovery, the next I propose to produce function AST's with an error attribute for the error'ed  functions. 

One thing I find interesting is that the style change in 3b11214 caused a recompilation of nearly everything that took 15 minutes. The corresponding change where the scanning/parsing/ast building is in its own phase takes 2 minutes. 

Pehaps the cache is not working automatically? I'd be curious if you have similar experineces. Specifically how long does it take to build the compiler from scratch on the systems you use? And with making a change like 3b11214 ?

Please add a test that shows the capabilities of this technique.

What is the plan on how to continue here? For example, if we have code that has a function call like `f(,,)` (i.e. expecting an expression but it is left out)? Would you add "expectTokenOrDelete" for the commas, too? It might synchronize way out of line.

I actually think that it would be better to catch fatal parser errors at the appropriate places and then synchronize to a separator one level higher up, for example to the statement level or the closing parenthesis in this example.

Of course.

Error recovery is incremental. I just started with the simplest situation so as to be able to have something minimal to talk about. And to have something to follow through with more complete recovery into the AST. 

But since more detail is asked for, here goes. Really, I'm just elaborating on what i believe are commonly used methods for recursive descent (and more broadly LL and CFG grammar) error handling techniques.  One paper on error recovery is https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Efficient-and-Comfortable-Error-Recovery-in-Descent-Grosch/8ec16b0f5d9fd4ebb3dd5a5d2ce5c85df382c9c5 but the simpler version used so far here is Section 7 of  the very old and possibly seminal paper on the idea in https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/novak/yaccpaper.htm


Suppose we are inside a `ParameterList`  looking for a `Parameter`.

```
ParameterList = '(' ( Parameter (',' Parameter)* )? ')'
```

The set of tokens that can follow of a `Parameter` ina `ParameterList`  is either a `,` or a `)` so either of those would be scanned for.  Whether Parameter throws an error, or recovers on its own by being passed the set {`,`, `)`} is a decision that can be made later. There is nothing in the code right now that precludes a decision one way or another. 

> I actually think that it would be better to catch fatal parser errors at the appropriate places and then synchronize to a separator one level higher up, for example to the statement level or the closing parenthesis in this example.

Yes, that is one of the two possibilities described above. For some things the method used here is okay. For some things having a try/catch is better. There is nothing that says you have to use exclusively one or the other. 

In some situtations insertion of an expected token is possible too and that is mentioned in the Grosch paper.

Ok wonderful! Please try to change your code such that it has the least amount of code duplication.

I'd like to understand better. Right now there is `expectToken(Token::Semicolon)` and `expectTokenOrConsumeUntil(Token::Semicolon);`  that are similar.These two could be combined with the addition of an optional parameter which changes behavior.  Would that be preferable? 

Down the line, different behaviors may get added or changed for different kinds of recovery, and parameters might change to include token sets. If there is a desire to keep this all inside a single function with an options parameter, I can do that. I don't expect though that there would be more than one or two functions like `expectTokenOrConsumeUntil()`. In fact, I think this one function will last a very long time. Is that already too much though?

Perhaps we are loosing ourselves in too much detailed code discussion and it would be better to rather discuss the high-level strategy not based on an actual implementation?

For instance, in the test cases you gave, it looks like the better strategy to follow at least for those would be to assume the existence of a semicolon if it is expected rather than ignoring all tokens until the next semicolon. That of course also depends on what kind of source code we expect the recovering parser to work well on: Is it code where programmers e.g. just forgot to put a semicolon or is it rather code that is incomplete because it is just being written like in an IDE?

I agree.  (But I will put in another commit to reduce code duplication a tad, since that was suggested/requested)

> For instance, in the test cases you gave, it looks like the better strategy to follow at least for those would be to assume the existence of a semicolon if it is expected rather than ignoring all tokens until the next semicolon.

I would not like to commit to guessing possible common or best-case situations in advance of having something concrete to try out and evaluate that way. 

Adding tokens like a semicolon is certainly possible. However it is best done in conjunction with having the first sets of the nonterminal that follows. The Grosch paper mentions that. 

(And part of the reason why first sets would be useful here is that in contrast to deleting tokens, when inserting tokens you need to worry about making sure parsing terminates.)

And that information would probably get passed down which would cause major refactoring which right now I was trying to avioid before having some sort of working proof of concept that people can try. 

And it was my intention to have this extend outside of the solidity project and work with one of the real IDEs such as vscode-solidity since I've worked with that before. (But remix would be okay too.)

What do you think?

@chriseth @christianparpart  rebasing this off of develop and getting my changes in proved too difficult so  #6571 is what is current and uses try/except. I'd like to close this and move discussion there.

I am pretty sure that in the future I'll be able to keep the other up to date.
