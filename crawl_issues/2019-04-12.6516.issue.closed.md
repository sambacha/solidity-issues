Official logo: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/logo.svg

Should briefly highlight our preference about using the name and logo.

@ChrisChinchilla was this fixed by any chance?

@axic Ahh, I was sure this was for me or not, but not done. Where can I find the "guidelines"?

@franzihei do you want to perhaps look into this?

Basically what we may want to do is something like a "brand" section in the documentation.

Yes, will take this task over!

What I would need to know: 
- Under which license is the logo published? (e.g. some sort of [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license?)
- Was there ever an "official" font connected to the Solidity logo? If yes, which font is it?
- Who created the Solidity logo; was there ever some sort of brand identity defined alongside of it, e.g. specific colors to be used etc.?

@chriseth and @axic?

It was created by Ian Meikle - but I could not find any license anywhere.

Created a doc here. Please review @axic @chriseth --> https://hackmd.io/@franzihei/ryJRP10aL.
If you're ok with it I'll add it to the docs as a section in the `Additional Material` section somewhere here:

I think it makes sense, could call the section "Brand Guide" and place it below "Contribute" ?

The document mentions "cc-by" - is it clear how to properly attribute if you use the logo?

Good question @chriseth. Maybe we don't even need attribution...? If yes, I'll think about a way how attribution could work.
