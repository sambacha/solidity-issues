I'll add some more tests.

I've not been able to extensively fuzz this PR due to other blockers but this PR does pass against the current fuzzing corpus for the yul optimizer.

Does the corpus contain enough shift instructions? We should fix the blockers....

Yes, it should. To be sure, I will monitor the coverage from the fuzzing runs to see if the newly added lines in this PR have been hit.

I checked coverage of the newly added rules to the RuleList and it looks like the fuzzer hits them consistently (several hundred times with different inputs) without finding reporting errors.

`shlWorkaround` and the first two rules in this PR are checked in https://github.com/leonardoalt/solidity_proofs/pull/1.
The size of the variables is scaled down to 64 bits, where we assume that the result is the same for 256.

The last 4 rules are now also proved in https://github.com/leonardoalt/solidity_proofs/pull/1 for 128 bit values.
