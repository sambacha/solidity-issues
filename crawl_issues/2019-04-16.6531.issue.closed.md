# [\#6531 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6531) `closed`: [yul] add "return" statement

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-04-16 11:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6531):

Especially in order to implement "return" statements of higher order languages, it would be beneficial to add a "return" statement similar to the "break" statement with the exception that control flow continues at the end of the current function.

Impact on optimizer:
 - I think the impact on the optimizer is small since return does not perform a backwards jump

Naming:

The naming of the return statement could be more difficult because there already is a `return` opcode in the set of EVM opcodes. A preliminary brainstorming on new names for either the opcode or the statement has been done on a different [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4576#issuecomment-456831351).

Another solution would be to only allow the return statement in strict assembly and distinguish the statement from the opcode by whether a `(` follows or not.

The full inliner has to be modified when this is implemented - it has to re-add the mechanism we currently use to exit functions.

Most optimizer stages need no modification, but we need to be careful about things like RedundantAssignEliminator, because the return values have to be preserved.

TerminationFinder has to be adapted.

The full inliner probably just should not inline functions that contain the `leave` statement. They tend to be rather large anyway and then should be optimized in isolation.
