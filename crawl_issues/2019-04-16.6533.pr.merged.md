# [\#6533 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6533) `merged`: Maximum clang/gcc debugging when debugging desired.

`-g3` adds macro information. See https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html
Both clang and gdb support this, and I think this preferred over the older `-ggdb`.

Sounds like a good change suggestion! We should verify whether we release binaries in this mode on any platform and if it has an impact on code size, reproducible builds, etc. (we used to release binaries in this mode, but I am not sure about the current state).
