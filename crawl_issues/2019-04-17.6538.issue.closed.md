# [\#6538 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6538) `closed`: [ossfuzz] proto generator generates duplicate case literals in switch statements
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `testing :hammer:`

## Description

A switch statement in yul can have case literals that are decimal, hexadecimal, or string. The yul parser treats more than one case statement with identically valued literals as duplicates.

The proto generator does not respect this logic while generating random yul code, so we could end up with code like this (which is simply rejected by the parser)

```
$ cat code.yul
{
  let x
  switch x
    case 1 {}
    case 1 {}
}
$ solc --strict-assembly code.yul
5:5: Error: Duplicate case defined.
    case 1 {}
    ^-------^
```

Although such unparseable code accounts for about 1% of the total number of randomly generated test cases, it is a bug that needs to ensure the proto generator produces valid yul code only.
