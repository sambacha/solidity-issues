Create a CircleCI job that runs once a day and tests for memory leaks.

### Open questions
* Only for branch develop?
* Or for develop and/or a special branch that people can merge their work to in order to get it checked.

### Motivation
Memory leaks and address issues should be caught early. (But checking upon every PR push is probably exploding CPU cycles too much).

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
