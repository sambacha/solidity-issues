## Description

The `YulStringRepository` class

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/4509e8efbb64637df26e5d072a289b57d600b5ec/libyul/YulString.h#L37-L86

does not reset its members. This means memory allocations made by the class are not reclaimed within a fuzzing iteration. Consequently, they end up accumulating heap memory over time and bringing down the fuzzing process because at some point, the fuzzing process consumes more memory than what is available to it.

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

TODO: Add more actionable details
