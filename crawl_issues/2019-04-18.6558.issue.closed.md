@chriseth is there a workaround for this issue? we are adding our own precompiled contracts which need to be marked as pure... maybe an alias for the `call` instruction, like `pure_call` to signal intent

There is staticcall, but that's as far as it goes.

thanks, got it to work. In case anybody else needs to do something similar:

```

// set inputs in memory
uint256[4] memory input;
// input[0] = ...
// input[1] = ...
// input[2] = ...

// create a memory region for return value
uint256[1] memory retval;

// success == 1 if the call is successful 
uint256 success;
assembly
{
    success := staticcall(not(0), 0x85, input, 0x80, retval, 32)
}

if (success != 1) {
    return address(0);
}
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
