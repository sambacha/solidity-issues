# [\#6569 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6569) `merged`: Add ossfuzz builder to nightly workflow

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-04-23 08:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6569):

It looks like the ossfuzz builder was missing in the nightly workflow that included the ossfuzz regression job. This PR adds the builder to the nightly job. Hopefully, with this change, the regression job should not complain.
