# [\#6571 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6571) `closed`: [WIP] Parser Recovery (add "error" grammar rules)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8851?v=4" width="50">[rocky](https://github.com/rocky) opened issue at [2019-04-23 21:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6571):

**Note:** this has been updated.

Add parser recovery rules:

```
SourceUnit = Error $
Block = '{' Error '}'
ContractDefinition = '{' Error '}'
Statement = Error';'
```
Note: this is documented in the [Error Recovery Grammar](https://github.com/rocky/solidity/blob/recoveringParser0/docs/miscellaneous.rst#error-recovery-grammar)  section of `miscellaneous.rst`.

TODO:

* Adjust existing tests which expect different error messages
* Add some unit tests for some lower-level functions
* Turn `catch` code into a macro which takes a parameter a
  grammar rule function and terminating symbols?
* Isolate into a new exception `PaserError` distinct from `FatalParserError`? (I tried this and it wasn't working)
* Feedback and probably a number of smaller tweaks.

# Try/catch added to ContractDefinition in recoveryParser0

This code is preliminary just to get a sense of what I'm doing and where we might go next. It's easier to work out the details of the error messages before actually coding - the stuff below is just a guide.

The most important thing is that if a particular contract has an error, other contracts in the file are still processed.

## Examples of Error Recovery

Source code:
```
contract Error2 {
	mapping (address => uint balances; // missing ) before "balances"
}
```

gives:

```
e2.sol:9:27: Error: Expected ')' but got identifier. Inserting ')' before here.
	mapping (address => uint balances; // missing ) before "balances"

```

The only difference here from what is in production right now is that the message is a little more explicit  - recovery in effect right now in production _inserts a token where it is unambiguous_. 

Source code: 

```
pragma solidity >=0.0.0;

contract Error3 {
	constructor() public {
	    balances[tx.origin] = ; // missing RHS.
	}

	// This function is unaffected.
	function five() returns(int) {
	  return 5;
	}

}
```
gives: 
```
e3.sol:5:28: Error: Expected primary expression.
	    balances[tx.origin] = ; // missing RHS.
	                          ^
e3.sol:5:28: Warning: Recovered in <Statement> at ';'.
	    balances[tx.origin] = ; // missing RHS.
	                          ^
```
The example shows recovery at the statement level. Another subtle difference is that `five()` is now processed, whereas in production it is skipped.

Source: 
```
pragma solidity >=0.0.0;

contract E7 {
	constructor() public {
	    balances[tx.origin] = // missing RHS and semicolon.
	}

}
``` 

gives: 

```
e7.sol:6:2: Error: Expected primary expression.
	}
	^
e7.sol:6:2: Error: In <Statement>, ';' is expected; got '}' instead.
	}
	^
e7.sol:6:2: Warning: Recovered in <Block> at '}'.
	}
	^
```

This is almost like the previous example E3, but a recovery token `;`  for _Statement_ can't be found.  The position is reset at the point of error. At the next higher level,  `Block` error recovery is performed. 

In both recovery examples, the position of recovery is the same as the position of error, which is not the usual case. However it does point out why in recovery we should not _advance()_ in _expectToken()_ as is currently done in production.

As discussed, skipping until the requested token is no the best strategy for the test files you provide. Please either modify the test files or the strategy - I would strongly suggest to change the strategy.

~But it is not a _bad_ strategy here. And it beats what we have now.  A problem with adding a semicolon is that you have to be concerned that error recovery will terminate. There are approaches that do handle this, but they are more complicated. There was concern expressed previously around making the code more complex.~ 

On further investigation what I wrote above is wrong. Currently _expectToken()_ does have the effect of inserting a missing token. However there are cases were try/catch recovery is desirable. Specifically this is in the larger groupings which have unambiguous synchronizing tokens like `;` and `}`. Specifically `Block`, `ContractDefinition` and `Statement`. 

I am not opposed to adding more complicated mechanisms which assess whether to insert or delete and do so in an informed way. However let's do this later. Right now this is a proof of concept.

Right now there is some better basic recovery. Let us push this all the way through to see that we can get useful ASTs, and use this in IDEs. 

~But sure, I can~ I have added examples that show where deleting tokens is the right thing to do.

Summary of the meeting we just had (please correct me if I'm wrong): We don't know which strategy is best in the actual day-to-day use, and this is hard to determine, so it is probably best to implement some strategy that is not too invasive, try it out for real and improve it later or in the worst case start over :)

Another issue that just popped up in a different thread: The error reporter will also throw a fatal error once the number of errors reaches a certain number. We should not try to recover in that case, because any further error will again lead to that fatal error. It might make sense to split the exception types into two.

Good catch! Yes it sounds wise to split the exception types into too. The name of the exception of fatal error thrown when there are too many exceptions seems to be the place of smallest change. If you want to suggest a name for that, I'll use it. Otherwise I'll come up with indicating it is a too-many-errors fatal exception.
