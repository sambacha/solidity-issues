Thank you for your pull request! This makes some additional operators work, but I think there is still a lot missing and I'm pretty sure that a plain translation from token to builtin function does not work here. For division, we at least need the division by zero check and for all other operations we do want overflow checks. This has been on the roadmap for a very long time, requested by many people and we always promised that it will be introduced one we have yul. We plan to switch overflow checks off by using an `unchecked` block - please see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/796
