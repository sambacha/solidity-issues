# [\#6586 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6586) `closed`: allow inlining of constant constructor variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18486361?u=cac77d2dd2d35da2a23b747090a48cb801ca94ce&v=4" width="50">[rainbreak](https://github.com/rainbreak) opened issue at [2019-04-24 13:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6586):

Currently the constructor does not respect the `constant` keyword and occupies storage slots unnecessarily.

```
contract C {
    uint constant x;
    constructor(uint x_) public {
        x = x_;
    }
    function get() public view returns (uint) {
        return x;
    }
}
```

Here, the function `get` will sload `x` from the first storage slot. However `x` could have instead been inlined into the contract code, avoiding using up any slots and avoiding a relatively expensive sload. This would be important in contracts that use delegatecall and wish to avoid any runtime dependence on their own storage.

This code does not compile for me and it actually should not occupy any storage slot. Is this intended as a bug report or a feature request?

Sorry, yes this is a duplicate. Also of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6561
