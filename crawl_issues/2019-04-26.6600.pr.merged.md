Nice, thanks a lot! Could you add some YulOptimizerTests so we can see the effect?

Also, this is quite a lot of code, I hoped it would be a bit smaller...
Do you assume the code is in "split" form?

Ok, will temporarily use `YulOptimizerTest` to test it. (We probably want to rename `YulOptimizerTest` to `YulTransformTest` in the future?)

> Do you assume the code is in "split" form?

Is this a naming suggestion? If we need to give a name to these transformed yul code, I would probably simply call it "u64 form"

Yes, we should probably rename it, but you already added something to yulopti ;)

With "split" I mean the form produced by the ExpressionSplitter.

Oh.

Yes, I assume the expression splitter and disambiguator have already been applied.  So every function call's arguments are u256 variables, which can easily be expanded to corresponding four u64 variables.

(force pushed to rebase against develop, nothing changes beside this)
