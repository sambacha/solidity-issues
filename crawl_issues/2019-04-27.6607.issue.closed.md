## Description
Sorry for asking a outdated question. I have to compile solidity 0.3.1 beacuse of some reasons. But it is failed beacuse of without dependent repositories what I can't find. The error is like this:

sion@root:/home/dapp/nas/solc-versions/solc-library/solidity/build$ make

And I checked this error, which  is caused by the missing libdevcore folder, But I can't find the libdevcore folder correspondding version0.3.1. I am appreciate that if anyone could help.

I think back in those days we still used submodules. You might need https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/ and other repositories.

@SnBetter I assume you managed to compile it. Let us know if not.
