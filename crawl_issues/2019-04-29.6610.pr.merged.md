# [\#6610 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6610) `merged`: CircleCI run performance improvements

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-04-29 09:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6610):

The motivation behind this PR is to speed up CircleCI runs to not wait for too long when pushing to your code for review.

### Changes
* move always-same-tasks into a designated docker image; Dockerfiles reside in `/.circleci/docker/`
* designated soltest script for circleci in `/.circleci/soltest.sh` for running soltest (with aleth) exclusively
* soltest runs are now done via CircleCI jobs, one job per EVM version with custom flags, such as optimizer on / off.
* Ubuntu version in use now is: **19.04**
* codecov run in nightly jobs only

Splitup: don't we rather want to extract them into isoltest? Then `isoltest` could maybe also get an option to just run every e.g. 3th out of 5 tests?

Absolutely. I just wanted to make sure I can speed up compilation. That should negate the (better) attempts.

Maybe rename the runs to `t_` and `b_` because sometimes the width is rather limited and we maybe don't want to waste the space so much for these names. Also `ub` for `ubuntu`?
