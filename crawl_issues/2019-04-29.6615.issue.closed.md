## Description

Do we want to know when some test input takes too long to process, where too long may be defined as taking time `t` longer than `MAX_TIME`? I understand that `MAX_TIME` is subjective to each fuzzer, so I created the following table with an initial draft of `MAX_TIME` to kick off the discussion

Fuzzer | Description | MAX_TIME (in seconds)
------------ | ------------- | -----------------
const_opt_ossfuzz | Fuzzes the constant optimizer | 1
solc_opt_ossfuzz | Fuzzes the solidity parser-optimizer | 10
solc_noopt_ossfuzz | Fuzzes the solidity parser | 5
strictasm_opt_ossfuzz | Fuzzes the strict assembly parser-optimizer | 10
strictasm_assembly_ossfuzz | Fuzzes the strict assembly parser-assembler | 10
strictasm_diff_ossfuzz | Differentially fuzzes the strict assembly parser-optimizer | 20
yul_proto_ossfuzz | Fuzzes the strict assembly parser-optimizer using protobuf | 10
yul_diff_proto_ossfuzz | Differentially fuzzes the strict assembly parser-optimizer using protobuf | 20

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
