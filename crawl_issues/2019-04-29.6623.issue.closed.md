## Description

Bug 1: At the moment, the nightly regression tests fail on first failure. Instead we should continue past failing tests and show a summary of all failures.

Proposed solution: Maintain a python array of state of each test and return `all()` of the boolean array.

Bug 2: Test status is not propagated to python script's exit status e.g., via `sys.exit()`

Proposed solution: Modify the return code of the test runner from True/False to `bash` exit codes. A zero return means success, failure otherwise. All tests pass when `any(returnCodeList)` is also zero i.e., no test fails.
