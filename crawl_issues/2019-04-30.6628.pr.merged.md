# [\#6628 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6628) `merged`: Remove clang+osx ld warning

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8851?v=4" width="50">[rocky](https://github.com/rocky) opened issue at [2019-04-30 11:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6628):

Boost libraries on osx use visibility=hidden to reduce unnecessary DWARF entries.

Unless we match visibility, ld will give a warning message like:

   ld: warning: direct access in function 'boost::filesystem... from file ...
   means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings.
