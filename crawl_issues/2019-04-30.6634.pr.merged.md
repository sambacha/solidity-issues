# [\#6634 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6634) `merged`: Conversion: remove confusing int8 type

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101816?u=c2a8573fd5b40e4746c18f2f17bce4d549004753&v=4" width="50">[asymmetric](https://github.com/asymmetric) opened issue at [2019-04-30 14:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6634):

The topic of converting a smaller type into a larger one is orthogonal to the one discussed in the example (namely, conversion between signed and unsigned integers).

Therefore, we change the `int8` to an `int` to make the example clearer.
