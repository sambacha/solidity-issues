## Description

```
{
let a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3
function foo_0(x_0) -> x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4
{
for {
mstore8(1, 1)
}
slt(1,keccak256(1,msize())){
let x_5, x_6, x_7, x_8 := foo_0(x_0)
}
{
continue
}
}
a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3 := foo_0(calldataload(0))
sstore(0, a_0)
sstore(32, a_1)
sstore(64, a_2)
sstore(96, a_3)
}
```

produces the following trace

```

            slt(1, keccak256(1, msize()))                
            {

            {
                continue
            }

```

If this can be attributed to memory opcode optimization, we may need to think of how we compare traces.

Notes on unoptimized program trace
- Foo called
- mstore(1,1) msize()=32
- keccak(1,32) > 1 msize()=64
- continue
- post block Foo called
- mstore(1,1)
- keccak (1,64) < 1 msize()=96
- return from post block Foo
- keccak (1,96) < 1 msize()=128
- return to Foo call site

What I don't understand in the trace of the optimized program is why the for loop condition is not evaluated on return from the post block Foo call site.

Looks like a bug in the Yul interpreter but am not sure.

@bshastry I would also say it is a bug in the interpreter, I cannot find a semantic difference between the two programs.
