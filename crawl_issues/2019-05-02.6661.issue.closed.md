## Description

```
{
let i
for {} lt(i,2) { if gt(i,1) { mstore(0,0) mstore(0,1) } } { i := add(i,1) continue }
}
```

should store `1` at offset `0` at program termination but stores `0` instead.

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

The reason is a for-loop post block is different than for-loop body block. At the moment, they are treated identically by the interpreter.

We should be ~~backing up loop state prior to entering post-block, setting it to default, and restoring on return from post-block.~~ resetting loop state prior to entering post-block.
