Update: Incorporated review comments but the code needs to be refactored :)

Updated the PR. Changes from last review are

- used `YulUtilFunctions::suffixedVariableNameList` instead of custom for loop (introduces libsolidity as dependency, see #6710 )
  - Added libsolidity as dependent library for the non-differential proto fuzzer since the differential proto fuzzer already transitively links libsolidity via libyulInterpreter
- made switch cases more elegant where possible (used BOOST_FALLTHROUGH annotation to silence compiler warning)
- Increased test file size limit from 600 bytes to 1200 bytes
  - This is experimental and an optimal upper bound needs to be experimentally determined
  - Increase was necessary because the fuzzer was more regularly synthesizing larger test cases. This is expected because we have at least 3 functions in each test.

Thank you. I unindented all case statements :)
