Adds the following Steve-Johnson style error recovery rules: 

    SourceUnit = Error $

    ContractDefinition = '{' Error '}'
    Statement = Error ';'

TODO:

* Add some unit tests

The PR looks great, thanks a lot!

You can add an option to `StandardCompiler::InputsAndSettings` to use this for the standard-io via solc-js, but it's not that easy to use standard-json without tools, but all tools should use it ;)

I think some of the tests are still failing.

These don't look directly related to changes I made. The recursion limit thing for example. I could use help  here in figuring out what's wrong or how to replicate this outside of CircleCI or with the access that I have here for that.

As for setPosition, I'll change that in the next iteration.

@chriseth Thanks for catching. This should be fixed in 0a1fe78 . I have testing building on OSX now. 

As for the CI spell check failure, I think that was mentioned in gitter solidity-dev as a false positive that was recently introduced, no? At any rate the variable name `errorString` (instead of `error string`) is correct.

@rocky yep, now the only remaining failure is the spell checker which is a known issue on develop.

I am not able to respond to individual conversations, so I'll respond in batch here. 

WRT [Do we really want that behaviour? I would expect to either throw an exception or set the position to "EOS", but not to just do nothing...](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6681#discussion_r285925179)

I was _documenting_ the _existing_ behavior, where it hadn't been made explicit. Please let's not change the code outside of the current scope. I am sure that after a proof of concept is done this and a whole bunch of other things will get revisited. 

WRT [I'm still confused why we need two variables with basically the same name. I think it would be more readable if you replace all token by m_scanner->currentToken()](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6681#discussion_r285925179) 

`tok` is the original token expected. It is used in an error message. `token` travels along in error recovery  scanning. In commit f05880602 I have changed this to a `for` loop. Perhaps this makes this clearer. 

WRT https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6681#discussion_r284319011 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6681#discussion_r284333460 this should be addressed in bfc5f68d4

WRT [Don't you just want to query whether we are already past the limit without any side-effects?](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6681#discussion_r285923605)

The side-effect way is the existing behavior. You suggested a version of this as a non-side-effect when for error recovery testing. Instead of making two functions, I added the _advance_ parameter which is similar to one of the token peeking functions. Given this, what do you suggest?

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6681#discussion_r285924554 should be covered by 66709d6fc

This however is an example of something that offers a commit that were it take would break compilation. Better from my standpoint would have been to put a comment on the declaration line suggesting the name change, rather than offering a broken commit .
