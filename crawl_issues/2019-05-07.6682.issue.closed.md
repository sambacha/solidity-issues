## Abstract
Reading from storage with no effect should raise a warning as well as the statement `2==2` does.

## Demonstration
Compile this contract.
```
pragma solidity >=0.5.8;

contract Test {
 
 mapping(uint256 => uint256) map;
 uint256 variable = 2;
 
 function getMsg() public view returns(string memory) {
     map[1]==3;  // This does NOT raise any warning
     variable==3;  // This does NOT raise any warning
     2==2; // This raises a warning
     return "Hello";
    }
 
}

```

**Warning** should say : Statement has no effect.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
