@axic maybe we can already merge this? I think it implements bmt correctly but is not yet used anywhere. Even if not, it can still be changed.

Without looking closer at the specification, I think the "new implementation" correctly implements the chunker. The reason why I'm so sure about it: The old swarm hash implementation used a similar scheme, and it looks like they just swapped out the lower part of it.

Still, the refactoring in "new implementation" somehow broke the previously correct implementation on short (bmt-only) data.

The hashing method is now in line with the (buggy) version used by the latest swarm binary.

Maybe we should also soon add a switch to use ipfs for the cbor metadata.

Rebased and renamed the internal functions.
