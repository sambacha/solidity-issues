# [\#6684 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6684) `closed`: If loop body contains terminating statement, remove dead code in for-loop post block

If there is a terminating statement in for-loop body block, code in post block will never be executed.

I fear this transformation is not that simple. You cannot remove the `post` block if there is a `continue` statement anywhere in the loop.

Removing FunctionDefinitions in the initial code is a bug, though, but I think we can just make it depend on the FunctionHoister.

A similar mechanism is required for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6619 so it might be worth doing both at the same time.

Oh you are right... How did I forget to consider this..

Wonder if checking whether there are continue statements (except continue statement in nested for-loop) present in loop body is enough. (Seems correct)

Should it belongs to dead code eliminator?

#6619 should not belong to the dead code eliminator, but I'm actually not sure if your pull request should belong to the dead code eliminator either.
