# [\#6686 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6686) `merged`: Move gas cost tests from command line tests to interactive gas cost tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-05-07 11:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6686):

With #4764 the deploy costs will differ between releases and prereleases due to differing metadata size. Hence the gas tests are moved to interactive tests, which will later be able to correctly adjust the gas expectations for release builds.

In anticipation of #4764 the creation gas costs are already parsed as ``u256``, whereas function gas estimates are stored and compared as plain strings.

The TestCase kind itself is rather basic (no highlighting, etc.), but should be sufficient for this use case.
