# [\#6695 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6695) `closed`: Event overloading with dynamic arrays are encoded incorrectly
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44851744?v=4" width="50">[businessfriendlyusername](https://github.com/businessfriendlyusername) opened issue at [2019-05-08 02:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6695):

When overloading events that return arrays, some of the event parameters seem to go missing. Overloading and arrays seem to be mutually exclusive.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.6
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): unsure
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): bug is in both Truffle and Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ganache
- Operating system: ubuntu

## Steps to Reproduce

Minimal example that has the buggy behavior:

```
contract C {
    event E(uint[] x);
    event E(uint x);
  
    function g() public {
        emit E(789);
    }
}
```
The emit issues
```
"from": "0xde6a66562c299052b1cfd24abc1dc639d429e1d6",
		"data": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000315",
		"topics": [
			"0x002ff0672f372fbe844b353429d4510ea5e43683af134c54f75f789ff57bc0c0"
		]
```
If you comment `event E(uint[] x);` it works.
If you use `ABIEncoderV2` it's also incorrect.
If you use `indexed` it's also incorrect.

This looks similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4292

@businessfriendlyusername thanks for the report!
If you don't mind I'll edit the title of the issue to be a bit more precise.

Ok after an initial closer look I don't think it's related to #4292

@businessfriendlyusername 
I used your original code
```
contract EventTest {
  event marketCreated(address[] virtualShareAddresses, address market, uint256 indexed endTime, string description, string extraInfo);//categorical
  event marketCreated(address[2] virtualShareAddresses, address market, uint256 indexed endTime, string description, string extraInfo);//binary
  event marketCreated(address[2] virtualShareAddresses, address market, uint256 indexed endTime, string description, string extraInfo, int256 _minPrice, int256 _maxPrice, uint256 _numTicks);//scalar


  function createYesNoMarket(
    uint256 _endTime,
    string memory _description,
    string memory _extraInfo
    ) public payable returns (bool) 

  {
    address[2] memory virtualShareAddresses;
    address newMarket = address(0);
    virtualShareAddresses[0] = address(1);
    virtualShareAddresses[1] = address(2);
    emit marketCreated(virtualShareAddresses, address(newMarket), _endTime, _description, _extraInfo);
    return true;
  }
}
```
Calling the function on Remix with arguments `123, "description", "extraInfo"` I get this:
```

		]
	}
]
```
Notice that the data is correct: `6578747261496e666f` = `extraInfo`.
If I comment the first event out and run with the same parameters the data is shown in a nicer way though.
I also checked the assembly output of the two versions (with and without the first event definition) and they looked the same.
So in the end I don't think this is a bug in the compiler.

The real issue seems to be on Remix/Ethers:
