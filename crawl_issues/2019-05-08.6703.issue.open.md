```
  Contract:
    pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
    
    contract C {
        function f() public returns (bytes memory) {
            bytes memory m = new bytes(64);
            m[0] = 0x01;
            m[1] = 0x02;
            m[2] = 0x03;
            m[3] = 0x04;
            return m;
        }
    }
    

  Expected result:
  // f() -> 0x20, 4, hex"01020304", 0, hex"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

  Obtained result:
  // f() -> 32, 64, hex"0102030400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  Warning: Encoding does not match byte range. The call returned 128 bytes, but 128 bytes were expected.
```

This also fails after "updating":
```
 Contract:
    pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
    
    contract C {
        function f() public returns (bytes memory) {
            bytes memory m = new bytes(64);
            m[0] = 0x01;
            m[1] = 0x02;
            m[2] = 0x03;
            m[3] = 0x04;
            return m;
        }
    }
    

  Expected result:
  // f() -> 32, 64, hex"0102030400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

  Obtained result:
  // f() -> 32, 64, hex"0102030400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  
  Attention: Updates on the test will apply the detected format displayed.
```

How I got to this and what works is the following:
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract C {
    struct S { uint8 a; bytes1 b; }
    function g(S calldata s) external pure returns (bytes memory) {
        return msg.data;
    }
	function f(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (bytes memory) {
		S memory s = S(2,0x02);
		return this.g(s);
	}
}

// ----
// f(uint256,uint256): 1, 1 -> 0x20, 0x44, hex"15fc073c", 2, left(0x02), hex"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```
But this also yields weird suggestions for incorrect or short expectations, e.g.
```
 Expected result:
  // f(uint256,uint256): 1, 1 -> 0x20, 0x44, hex"15fc073c", 1, left(0x02), hex"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

  Obtained result:
  // f(uint256,uint256): 1, 1 -> 32, 68, hex"15fc073c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```
Or

```
 Expected result:
  // f(uint256,uint256): 1, 1 -> 0x20, 0x44, hex"15fc073c"

  Obtained result:
  // f(uint256,uint256): 1, 1 -> 0x20, 0x44, hex"15fc073c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

This is still somewhat a problem, this is what it gets updated with:
```
  Contract:
        pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
        
        contract C {
            function f() public returns (bytes memory) {
                bytes memory m = new bytes(64);
                m[0] = 0x01;
                m[1] = 0x02;
                m[2] = 0x03;
                m[3] = 0x04;
                return m;
            }
        }

  Expected result:
  // f() -> 0x20, 4, hex"01020304", 0, hex"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

The issue persists, so will triage as low priority.
