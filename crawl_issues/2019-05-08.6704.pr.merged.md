# [\#6704 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6704) `merged`: Add ABIEncoderV2 cleanup tests.

Fixes #6466.

Are there any other test cases we could add? I think simple one-dimensional arrays and small structs are enough for this.

The tests all consist of ``f*`` functions that create dirty variable values via inline assembly and then externally call a ``g*`` function (involving ABI-encoding the arguments). The function names are chosen so that the test expectations are aligned and it's easy to see which values are valid (``f*`` and ``g*`` behave equally) and which are invalid, but cleaned by the encoder (``f*`` cleans and succeeds, but ``g*`` fails the validation).

Some tests are failing.

Updated - I think it should work now - I think it was the homestead run not supporting some of the tests, so I configured those with ``EVMVersion: >homestead``.
