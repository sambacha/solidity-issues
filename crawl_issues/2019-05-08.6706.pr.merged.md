I would argue the opposite, that the only place that we care about the order of the touched variables is inside `mergeVariables` since it adds assertions.

But now you have to sort in ``mergeVariables`` - whereas if you use ID comparison everywhere (instead the default pointer comparison), it will already be sorted... and outside ``mergeVariables`` it doesn't matter which comparison is used for sorting, so why not sort by ID all the time? One could argue that sorting by ID means one more indirection while inserting... But yeah, it really doesn't matter :-D.
