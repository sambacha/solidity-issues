Phew - this really worked! Ok, not fully - we are still missing some external functions to go to wasm binary format, but as far as the compiler is concerned, it is able to generate code.

Ready for review. I would suggest to merge even though the polyfill is not yet complete.

I think we'll have to add some more elements to the SMT proofs once this is ready.

Merging, even though add_carry still has bugs.
