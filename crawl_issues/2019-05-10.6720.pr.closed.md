# [\#6720 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6720) `closed`: [Draft] Yul Block Outliner

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-05-10 01:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6720):

Draft for #6713.
Needs some cleanup and should probably use less vectors of pairs of vectors and such, but it already seems to work quite well.
It'll probably be able to supersede the ``EquivalentFunctionCombiner`` in the end.

The main things that are missing conceptually are:
 - [ ] Define some heuristics to decide when to outline blocks.
 - [x] Distinguish between arguments and return values for the outlined functions instead of passing everything in and out - although that might be done in a separate component as well.

The whole AST is copied with this PR - we can consider whether trying to move/modify could work, but I tend to think it's not worth the effort.
Also missing:
 - [ ] yulopti support
 - [ ] integration into full suite (depends on solving the main issues above)
 - [ ] the actual hashing should still be tuned and the performance should be evaluated

Also I think function hoister should be a requirement, not just a recommendation due to scoping.

Actually I'm not sure about the function hoister - I was wondering about it and changed it a few times between recommendation and requirement :-). There is syntactic equality and all external references are tracked and reproduced/passed along during outlining anyways, so I think it might in fact be just fine... but I'll think about it some more and the safest choice is just making it a requirement anyways...

What will it do on the following (note the doubly nested blocks) ?
```
{
  {
    function f() -> x { x := 1 }
    { mstore(f(), 2) }
    { mstore(f(), 2) }

Ok, now only the variables that are in fact potentially assigned to are used as return values - the opposite would be cool as well, but that's more tricky - I could skip parameters that are never read from, but I won't be able to skip parameters that are always assigned to before being read from, because that depends on control flow analysis - so I'll keep it as is for now, maybe an improvement for later or a job for a separate component.

@chriseth I added two more test cases with nested blocks that demonstrate the behaviour - in the ``nested_inner`` one the outline is of course silly, but that's due to the stub ``shallOutline``.
I'll look into name hints next.

About "parameters that are always assigned to before being read from" - it looks like this won't be a problem if you do this after SSA transform and redundant assign eliminator.

True - then it's worth detecting that, I'll do so!
EDIT: i.e. I'll try to check which variables are *never* read from and not pass them as arguments.

This will probably need another look in the end to check for potential simplifications.

Next important thing would be the outlining heuristic - something along the lines of ``!FullInliner::shallInline`` I guess.
Might make sense to track the function in which blocks are contained and outline more aggressively for large functions... and the argument/return/external reference count should play a role...

I'm generally a little worried because we often compromise on clarity on behalf of efficiency. For example, it would be much nicer to have a single visitor that computes the "free break/continue" property for each AST element.

If we would switch to cryptographic hashes, we may be able to compute this and many other properties in a lazy way. Furthermore, we might even be able to cut several branches of the search if the AST did not change there.

Yes, the "free continue/break" detection could be separate.
I don't think cryptographic hashes are a good idea though - they are generally orders of magnitudes slower, which I'm pretty sure will outweigh all the benefits of the guarantees they might provide. But I'm not sure I understand what you mean with cutting branches...
I originally had hashing in a separate step, but I'm not sure it's all that useful to have outside the block class detection, but it'd be easy to separate again - we might e.g. track visited hashes as "termination condition" for the optimizer, but I haven't thought that through, yet.

But yeah: in general this is really meant as draft and proof-of-concept - I'm sure there's a lot of opportunities to refactor, simplify and nicen the whole thing.

I'm not sure whether we need some supplementary step that splits blocks (as counter-operation for the flattener). Or we can consider moving to something more fine-grained than blocks or at least consider block prefixes as well...

``FunctionGrouper`` is also a requirement unless we generate new names for the arguments and return values of the outlined function.

Independently of cryptographic hashes or not, the hashing in the draft is very suboptimal so far, so that has to be improved in any case. We might also want to consider whether it's worth to exploit semantic equivalence with the hash (e.g. commutativity of operations or even movability of statements). That would require a more involved equality comparison as well, though, unless the resulting hash can reasonably be assumed to be collision free.
The greater issue I see so far is that blocks are too large and we need to introduce artificial blocks or be more fine-grained than blocks to get actual results... we should probably discuss our options and how to move forward before I continue with refactoring and cleaning up this draft.

For commutativity can't you just sort the operands and hash?

@leonardoalt Yes, that'd be one way to do it for the hashs (or one could use some xor-based commutative way to combine argument hashes or something like that) - but the real question is, whether it's worth the additional complexity. Syntactic equality comparison wouldn't be enough anymore and we'd need to track commutativity for at least instructions/builtins or for everything...

Yes, but if you make a pass sorting the arguments (where applicable), wouldn't a syntactic eq comp be enough after that?

Ah ok, actually sorting them in the AST - true we could in fact do that... We don't really have a linear order on AST nodes, though :-). But one could use the hash values to define one... well - it's something to think about, but probably only for a later step anyways.

The main issue is still that blocks aren't fined-grained enough especially since we use the BlockFlattener. So we either need to create prefix- (and maybe suffix-)-hashes on the statement level or we have a separate step that artificially introduces blocks (e.g. a new block after each statement). The latter should be simple, so maybe I'll quickly write such a step first to see what happens and we can later remove this step and generally hash/compare on statement level.

If we re-sort the nodes, we should also make the ExpressionJoiner aware of that.

I'm just realizing that the ``BlockDeepener`` I considered for getting around to deal with hashes on the statement level would only have helped in outlining suffices of blocks, not prefixes... so maybe actually working on the statement level might still help...

Note after realizing this in #6776:
We should *always* outline even if there is only one block class representative, if we are a function body and have less external reads than arguments or less external writes than return values, since that'll basically perform unused argument and return value removal (after one inlining pass for which we should make sure that it actually performs the required inline, but I think it should already).

It does this at the cost of losing information about the values. I'm not so sure if it's not better to remove unused parameters is its own steps.

If you outline the body in `if (eq(x, y)) { ... }`, then in that outlined function, you do not know anymore that `x` and `y` are equal. At least you would first have to check where the function is called.

Sure, but that's "proper outlining" of subblocks of a function - when outlining the whole function body (reducing the original function to a single function call and assigning to return values) and inlining the remaining "skeleton" of the original function (i.e. unused argument and return value removal), then no information should be lost.
