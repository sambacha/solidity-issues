Thanks for the pull request!

Some of these actually require a `move` because it is a return with conversion, at least for GCC 7.3.0, which reports an error if you _add_ the move. Is this a bug in one of the two compiler versions or does it depend on the actual return? Did you only change those returns that lead to an error in GCC 9.1?

I changed all returns which leads to an error in GCC 9.1. I will try to investigate the issue with for GCC 7.3.0. I want to make Conan package for Solidity https://github.com/AndreyBronin/conan-solidity

Maybe when returning ``variant``s we should actually return ``{ std::move(result) }`` instead of ``std::move(result)`` or ``result`` to make it clear that it's not subject to return value optimization. In general I would be careful with GCC's "redundant move" warnings - I read somewhere that it warns, whenever *GCC* would move anyways, but not necessarily only where the standard demands that a move is performed (so e.g. clang might still actually need the explicit move) - we should check that and possibly just disable these warnings.

Yep, that (`return { std::move(result) };`) sounds like it should work well for all versions.

Ok, I checked on OS X GCC 9.1 from Brew and inside docker container from gcc:9 - works fine.
