This optimizer step is the equivalent of the RedundantAssignEliminator, but for storage and memory. It could use https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6727 as a dependency.

Since the RedundantAssignEliminator does not use the DataFlowAnalyzer, we could also make it a little easier, though: Eliminate two stores if they store at the same symbolic location, i.e. variable, and that variable has not been reset in the meantime.
