Are you sure this is not just the YulStringRepository leak? ASTCopier::translateVector is one of the main components in the Disambiguator, the component that probably causes most of the strings to be generated.

I copied the call sites reported by the fuzzer as is. It is possible that they are related.

@bshastry is this still the case? @chriseth could this be a contributor to the issue we're seeing in #10405 ?

I don't think this is related to performance. The house-keeping of DataFlowAnalyzer is just insane.
