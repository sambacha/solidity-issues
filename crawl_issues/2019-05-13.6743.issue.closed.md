## Abstract

<!--
Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.
-->

EVM runner is a wrapper around an EVM interpreter (e.g., evmone) that accepts arbitrary EVM byte code as input and executes (interprets) it.

## Motivation

<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
