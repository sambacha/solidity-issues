<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description
Contract
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract A {
    struct Struct {
        string a;
        uint8 b;
        string c;
    }
    
    constructor(Struct memory s) public {}
}
```
reverts while deploying with arg:
```
{
  a: "",
  b: 0,
  c: ""
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.8
- Target EVM version: petersburg

This might be related to an invalid encoding of the parameters. Can you provide the encoding?

@chriseth  some more detail:

## Case A
#### Contract
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract A {
    struct Struct {
        string a;
        uint8 b;
        string c;
    }

    constructor(Struct memory s) public {}
}
```
#### Encoding
```
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020

```
#### Result
Revert

## Case B
Change the struct from `(string,uint8,string)` to  `(string,string,uint8)`
#### Contract
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract B {
    struct Struct {
        string a;
        string c;
        uint8 b;
    }

    constructor(Struct memory s) public {}
}
```
#### Encoding

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
#### Result
~Ok~
Not revert but the struct in constructor has wrong value

## Case C
Use the same struct as function parameter
#### Contract
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract C {
    struct Struct {
        string a;
        uint8 b;
        string c;
    }

    function foo(Struct memory s) public {}
}
```
