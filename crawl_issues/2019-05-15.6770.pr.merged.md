# [\#6770 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6770) `merged`: [isoltest] TestFileParser: Fixes access of iterator at and beyond iterator ends

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-05-15 15:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6770):

While isoltest/soltest worked on Linux wrt. this class, because GCC/Clang doesn't validate iterator access, MSVC however does. This is how I accidentally spotted it.

NB: I intentionally did not `solAssert()` in `Scanner::current()` nor in `Scanner::peek()` as it would have required more code changes. The current just explicitly states what was already happening on GCC/Clang side, returning the last byte, which is `'\0`.

p.s.: why didn't AppVeyor tell us. hmm
