# [\#6771 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6771) `merged`: Fix handling of structs of dynamic size as constructor parameters.

Fixes #6754

Does this deserve an entry in the bug list? The issue is that if all variables are statically sized and at least one is dynamically encoded (but statically sized), not enough data is copied to memory for the decoder.

I think the only types that are statically sized but dynamically encoded are structs or multi-dimensional arrays where the outer arrays is statically-sized.

As far as I know, such types are only supported by ABIV2, so this is not as bad as it sounds.

I'd tend to think that this warrants a buglist entry - ABIEncoderV2 is experimental, but if it is used already, then I guess it's most likely used for structs and possibly also in the constructor - so it might be good to emphasize this at least a bit.

The tests need to be disabled for homestead, though.

You are right, if we always use `codesize` then we get proper range checks.

The comment before calling abiDecode states ``// stack: <memptr>`` - that's probably wrong - it should be ``<memptr> <length>``... but it currently is ``<memptr> <end>`` isn't it? That'd be wrong too then - but I might have misread it. Anyways: yes: proper range checks would be nice and I think the costs shouldn't differ much for small ``argumentSize`` and should even be cheaper for large ones.

This still needs:
 - Disabling the new test cases for homestead, since the types are not available there.
 - Investigating the ``store_keccak256`` GasMeterTest and deciding whether we should consider that a problem.
 - ``abiDecode`` in ContractCompiler.cpp:L259, resp. now L244 is still called with a wrong second argument (it's passed the memory end ptr - ``abiDecode`` expects the length, though, and will itself perform a ``offset + length`` addition), which is still preventing correct range checks in the decoder - maybe we should also have a test case for that (i.e. short arguments revert at least with ABIEncoderV2? Not sure what the old decoder does in that case).

Still investigating store_keccak256, the other issues are hopefully fixed.

The `store_keccak256` test failed because no constructor argument was supplied and we did not do any bounds check before for fixed-size constructor parameters.
