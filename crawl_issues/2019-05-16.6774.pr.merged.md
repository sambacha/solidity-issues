Should the dialect be part of the BuiltinContext? Should the ``NoOutputEVMDialect`` be static as well?

Yes, NoOutputEVMDialect should also be static.

Why do you think that dialect should be part of BuiltinContext? The idea behind BuiltinContext is that this is some more or less opaque data structure where context-depending information relevant to the builtins can be stored during code generation.

Well, I'm not sure - in quite a few cases both the dialect and the context is passed around now - and if I think about the builtin context as "context" in the sense of "everything we need to know about builtins", it might fit in there and reduce the number of arguments to be passed around - or in other words: will there ever be a situation where one builtin context will be used with different dialects or vice versa? But anyways: I'm fine with keeping them separate.

The context is only passed to code generation. I actually moved it out of the dialect to enable dialects to be static - basically the idea was to only generate the list of builtin functions once per compiler life.

Sure - I'm not suggesting to merge the BuiltinContext back to the Dialect, but to let the (non-const) BuiltinContext contain a (const) Dialect, so:
```
struct BuiltinContext
{
	Dialect const& dialect; // or maybe Dialect const* dialect = nullptr;
	Object const* currentObject = nullptr;
	/// Mapping from named objects to abstract assembly sub IDs.
	std::map<YulString, AbstractAssembly::SubID> subIDs;
};
```
Just so that during code generation we have one thing less to pass around all the time, since one builtin context will only ever be used with one dialect, won't it?
But yeah: as I said: it's fine as it is as well.

Rebased.
