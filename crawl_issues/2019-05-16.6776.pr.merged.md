# [\#6776 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6776) `merged`: Use block hashes in EquivalentFunctionDetector.

Some collateral from #6720.

This should be faster in cases were the old heuristics is insufficient - I wouldn't expect false positives with the block hashes, but there can easily be with the old heuristics. Arguably, calculating the block hashes can be more expensive than vainly comparing functions, though...

I would propose to not implement this on FunctionDefinition and not on for loops with non-empty init part.

How does this detect that `function f(a) -> b { b := 1 }` and `function g(b) -> a { b := 1 }` are not equivalent? Or is that irrelevant for the heuristic and we check again in detail anyway?

The body blocks ``{ b := 1 }`` and ``{ b := 1 }`` *are* equivalent, so they will receive equal hashes - but the first thing the actual syntactic equivalence comparison does, is to check for equal parameters and return values - so it's fine, since it's just a heuristics.

Similarly for loops with non-empty init part will strictly speaking not be hashed correctly - the init scope will be an isolated block and the condition, body and post will treat variables as "external references". That's again not a problem for the purpose, but I'll still disallow it.

If you want, you can take out the init assertion again - as you say, it is fine to hash incorrectly.

Please squash.

For the purpose of outlining it'd actually be good to consider only the body block itself... Think:
```
function f(b,x) -> a, c, z {
  a := mload(b)
}
function g(b) -> a, c {
  a := mload(b)
}
```
We can still outline the block and end up with
```
function f(b,x) -> a, c, z {
  a := g_1(b)
}
function g(b) -> a, c {
  a := g_1(b)
}
function g_1(b) -> a {
  a := mload(b)
}
```
And can keep ``g_1`` (imagining that it's more complex), but inline ``f`` and ``g``...

We could even extend equivalent function detection this way to combine "similar" functions now already, but I'm not sure that's worth it...

Interesting! This means that outlining+inlining will do unused function parameter removal

Yes, it should :-).
I'd just keep the for-loop-init assertion in there, though - it doesn't hurt and when moving back to outlining it's easier not to have to think about external references and for-loop scopes that much (it's probably fine with loop inits, but why bother)...
