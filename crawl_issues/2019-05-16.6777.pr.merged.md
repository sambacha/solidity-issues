Oh and I will separate the test case update part into a separate commit later

This is probably far-fetched but is there an expression that when used as for-loop condition and this optimization step applied bears a different outcome because it is invoked at a later point.

```
for {} gas() {} {}
```

becomes

```
for {} 1 {}
{
  if iszero(gas()) break
}
```

If `gas()` returns `1`, in the transformed case does it still return `1`. I think so, but just wanted to be sure.

Also, what happens if we replace `gas()` in the above example with `pc()`, or say `msize()`?

`msize` will not be affected, but things like `gas` and `pc` will change with every single optimizer routine and just cannot be relied on, I would say. `gas` and `pc` even change when you transform `add(1,2)` to `3` at any place prior to the `gas` instruction.

Note that this transform does not change the order of instructions, it only changes jumps and jump labels.
