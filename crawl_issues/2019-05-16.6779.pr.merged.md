# [\#6779 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6779) `merged`: Fix gas cost test.

After #6778 determined the reason for the fluctuations, this is an attempt to actually fix it.

I wonder whether we actually need the tolerance for the calls after this.

Anyways, this is still a bit dirty, but I don't see a better fix right now...

For the record: https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/126610 succeeded with the first version of this PR without tolerances. I'm not pushing with the review suggestions, resulting in running again with a different commit hash - let's see whether it keeps working.

I'm tempted to let this finally fix #5803 - but the last time was premature as well :-).

I was just looking on the constant optimizer and now I'm wondering: is the (old) constant optimiser run on the cbor metadata as well and might it find a better representation for the bzzr0 hash than simply including it as literal? That would undermine the fix in this PR again - even though it's probably highly unlikely :-)...

Erm no :)
It only runs on push constants, the cbor metadata is a data element.

Ah no, the constant optimiser only considers ``PUSHX <constant>``

Yes, I just read further and realized that myself :-).
