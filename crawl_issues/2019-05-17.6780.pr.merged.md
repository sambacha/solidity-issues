# [\#6780 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6780) `merged`: make_vector helper for move initialization

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-05-17 07:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6780):

There are no rvalue initializer_lists which keeps being annoying when dealing with the Yul AST.

In #6777 @sifmelcara used ``boost::assign::list_of`` to compensate for that, but I looked into it and it will still perform a copy and will not work in all cases (``std::vector<Statement> x(boost::assign::list_of(Break{}))`` does work, because it constructs the non-copyable ``Statement``'s in place, but it still has to copy the ``Break``, so e.g. ``boost::assign::list_of(If{...})`` won't work).

~~I violated our coding style and called it ``make_vector`` instead of ``makeVector`` in accordance with ``make_unique``, ``make_shared``, ``make_array``, etc., but I can rename it, if desired.~~

I had a more complex version in #6720 that allowed forwarding constructor arguments as tuples, but for the cases I saw where it can be used now, we don't need that, so I kept it simple - we can extend it later, if desired.

I thought there were some more cases where this could be used in Yul IR generation, but I can't seem to find them...

If you take a close look at the coding style, you see that you did not violate it :)

Ah, ``except where obviously extending STL/boost functionality in which case follow those naming conventions`` - indeed, right :-).

Ah, yes ``wasm::Expression EWasmCodeTransform::operator()(ForLoop const& _for)`` - that's the one I was looking for...
