# [\#6786 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6786) `closed`: [yul] interpreter should not leave trace of side-effects of code that will be removed by the optimizer

## Description

(Found by ossfuzz nightly CI)

```
{
let a_0, _1, a
function foo_0(x_0,_2, x_2) -> x_6
{
let x_4 := extcodehash(extcodesize(1))
}
a_0 := foo_0(calldataload(0),0, a_0)
}
```

is optimized to

```
{}
```

I wonder why this was not a problem earlier. Wouldn't the redundant assignment eliminator have found this earlier?

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

This could just be because `a_0` is unused and the optimizer removes it altogether. This optimization was not happening before, so it is still a bug in the fuzzing setup.

Trace of unoptimized code

```
Trace:
  EXTCODESIZE(1)
  EXTCODEHASH(16387318)
```

Trace of optimized code is empty of course.

This is caused by #6746. `extcodehash` and `extcodesize` can be safely removed if their result is not used, so I think the optimizer is correct, but we probably need to adjust the trace so that it does not include these calls.

Okay! For completeness, this happens for any instruction that has a side-effect but I think this should not matter as long as we remove unused side-effects from the trace.

Should we add semantic tests for calls to the interpreter post optimization? Might help resolve issues like this in the future at the time of PR?

There are tests for the interpreter, but probably not enough...

Ah sorry, such a test would not have helped...
