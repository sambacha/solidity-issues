@chriseth I'm afraid the proto stuff is not ready for review yet. This PR was mainly meant for reviewing the evmone wrapper which itself is also not reviewable yet.

So, here's one proposal. Create separate (more easily reviewable) PRs for
  - [PR ready for review] evmone build CI integration (see #6803 )
  - [Upcoming PR]  evmone wrapper
  - [Upcoming PR] solidity wrapper (this accepts fuzzer input i.e., solidity and returns runtime bytecode)
  - [Upcoming PR] non-proto fuzzer harness to check if build works as intended
  - [Upcoming PR] proto fuzzer

Each of these PRs are meant to be incremental. Hope that's okay.
