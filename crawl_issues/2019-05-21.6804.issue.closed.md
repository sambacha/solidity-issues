# [\#6804 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6804) `closed`: [ossfuzz] Add a fuzzer and a solidity wrapper

## Abstract

Abiv2 fuzzer harness depends on a solidity wrapper that can generate bytecode from fuzzer supplied solidity code. This issue tracks support for this.

## Motivation

- Create a simple non-proto fuzzer harness that supplies random input to a solidity wrapper API
- solidity wrapper API accepts fuzzer supplied input and outputs runtime bytecode
  - the wrapper itself is another indirection from solidity compiler stack APIs

Since a non-proto fuzzer is of little utility for testing abiv2 coder, this issue is being closed. The solidity wrapper that the issue references is closed by #7069
