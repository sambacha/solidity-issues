# [\#6806 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6806) `merged`: Added a reference to an extended list of security recommendations.

@chriseth does that look like the good place + way of adding the reference? or did you have something else in mind? Since the list of security recommendations in the link is huge and formatted differently, I thought it would be better to reference it than to embed it.

Hm, weird, I thought we also link the consensys list somewhere. Can you link both at the end of the subsection, i.e. right before the `Pitfalls` section?
