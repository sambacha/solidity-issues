# [\#6808 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6808) `closed`: [yul] Remove memory related information from interpreter trace

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-05-21 15:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6808):

## Abstract

Currently, we rely on interpreter trace for comparing the "output" of pre and post optimized yul code, asserting that they are the same. "Output" concretely refers to interpreter (execution) trace.

#6798 removes side-effect free statements such as `sload`, `mload`, `gas`, `keccak256` etc. from the interpreter trace to re-enable differential fuzzing post merge of #6746 

Post memory optimization (see #6727 #6728 ), we can no longer rely on interpreter trace because memory instructions can be optimized out.

Memory and storage side-effects must be conveyed through state dumps (see #6800 ). Once #6800 is merged, we must remove memory related information from interpreter state.

This issue traces support for removing memory related information from interpreter trace such as

- `mstore`
- `sstore`

## Motivation

I think these lines can be deleted at least, code refactoring may be necessary.
