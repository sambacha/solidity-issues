# [\#6809 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6809) `merged`: [ossfuzz] Refactor build system so that ossfuzz harnesses can be built locally

closes #6653 

- How do we deal with proto fuzzer compilation?
  - Proto fuzzer includes headers from dependencies (libprotobuf-mutator, and libprotobuf)
  - Proto fuzzer contains [proto to yul translator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/tools/ossfuzz/protoToYul.cpp) that depends on C++ helper source/header file pair that is auto generated by protobuf's `protoc` compiler
   - These are called `yulProto.pb.h` and `yulProto.pb.cc` respectively

This PR currently only builds non-proto fuzzer harnesses along with other targets. There are currently two roadblocks to getting proto fuzzer to compile as well
  - How to deal with auto-generated C++ files? They are generated by `protoc` compiler which is an external dependency
  - How to include files from external deps such as libprotobuf-mutator and libprotobuf
