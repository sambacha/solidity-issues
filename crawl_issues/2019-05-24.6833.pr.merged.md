# [\#6833 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6833) `merged`: Fix assignment of struct containing array of mappings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-05-24 08:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6833):

### Description

Closes #6783 

I think we need to add a test, but not sure where is suitable for this test case. `syntaxTests` is not enough because the bug need actual codegen to happen to reproduce; run time tests that need IPC seems like an overkill.

### Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles correctly
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [ ] Used meaningful commit messages
