# [\#6834 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6834) `merged`: Fix reference links in types.rst

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-05-24 18:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6834):

### Description


Link to section `delete` is currently rendered as ":ref:`delete`" in https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.8/types.html. I guess this is not expected behavior?

I think there is no easy way to link to that section, because that section is actually in different `.rst`. The best I can do is to give up linking to that section.

Please feels free to close this PR if you get a better solution :)

Please keep the links. I think the format is somehow wrong. Furthermore, the `delete` section does not have an anchor name, which is required for linking across pages.

Thanks @sifmelcara so yes, the format is :ref:\`delete\<delete\>\`, and if you go to _operators.rst_ and add `.. _delete:` above the delete subheading, that should fix everything.

@ChrisChinchilla OK, I applied your suggestion and rebuilded. I can confirm it works!
