Rebased on top of #6805 so that the harness also includes a call to evmone wrapper

It works locally. This PR is only a portion of the change set required to start fuzzing abiv2 encoder with evmone though.

Closing this PR since I need to implement host callbacks before making evmone usable in our fuzzing setup.
