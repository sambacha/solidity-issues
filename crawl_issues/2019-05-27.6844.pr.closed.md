* [x] Extend Yul AST by adding `yul::Comment`  (adapt related code accordingly)
* [x] yul-format CLI for command line based reformatting (in spirit of `clang-format`)
* [x] cherry-pick 4843c275ea12d11f7ce6835cb381def3c700059e into its own PR (VS 2019 compilation fix)
* [x] make use of this functionality in solidity-to-yul codegen output to have pretty printed result.

This approach also needs to be taken into account when determining terminating control-flow.

This is missing many changes in the optimizer:
 - the structural optimizer does not consider blocks that only consist of comments as empty
 - the termination finder does not consider control flow terminating if it ends in a comment
 - the expression joiner will not join statements if they are separated by a comment

I believe to make this proper, many more changes are required and thus this is much bigger than the initially allocated scope.

In summary: a better implementation would be (as stated by @chriseth):
