You may find it easier to run a local copy to see changes with this PR instead of just looking at diff, not sure.

This PR contains too many changes - it actually looks like a failed rebase.

@chriseth Not where I am looking, I can just see one file change. 

As noted in a comment above, I rearranged things a bit, is that what you mean? In which case I'm not sure how best to create these changes as multiple PRs might be even more confusing.
