This is just to narrow what's up with Appveyor. 

Note we don't have problems on any other CI or OS other that the Appveyor one.

And now it works. Clearly this has something to do with the specific machine and its memory. 

There are a couple of options:

* Skip skip on Appveyor. (This might now even a Windows thing, so much as resources on the Windows box. 
* Have the test query resources and adjust the iteration count

@chriseth @leonardoalt @christianparpart @bshastry  - your thoughts?

Did you base this on top of your parser changes?

Closing since the other PR fixed it already.
