# [\#6884 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6884) `closed`: Add static z3 ppa script and update release PPA script.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-06-03 16:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6884):

Adds a script that triggers a PPA build for static Z3.
For now it uses my experimental PPA repository (https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental-static/+packages), but the builds seem to work. Next step would be to let the static build depend on the PPA repo containing the static Z3 build - I'll try that in an experimental PPA repo as well. If the resulting binary works, we can move forward.

Later the PPA repo and GPG keys have to be changed and we have to decide in which repo to put the static Z3 build.

~~Depends on #6891.~~ (merged)

Issue to be solved: linking against the static z3 library fails, since we need to statically link against openmp. I think @christianparpart already had the problem that no static libomp.a or libgomp.a was available - we might consider disabling openmp, if there's no other solution - or we need another PPA build of a static openmp library :-).

RL discussion: we can still link statically against Z3 and use a dynamic openmp which should be installed.

@ekpyron did you try that yet?

@leonardoalt For now I disabled OpenMP in the build - for the purpose of our static PPA builds that's probably what we need to do, if we don't want to create our own GCC build containing a static openmp lib. However, we can still consider having a second version of "semi-static" Z3 with openmp enabled and try to use that together with a dynamic OpenMP for the purpose of our dynamic PPA builds (which can't use stock Z3 either, since the shipped version is too old)...

If that works I think it's the best option too. Did it work with Z3 without OpenMP?

@leonardoalt Still needs to fix linking to pthreads, even with OpenMP disabled :-). (Which on the other hand suggests that Z3 falls back to regular threads, if OpenMP is disabled)

Ok, based on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6891 and having disabled OpenMP in the Z3 PPA build I can now successfully build an entirely static solc linked against the static PPA release of Z3.

One could argue about the package name - maybe ``libz3-static-dev`` would be more appropriate...

The segfaults I'm getting when running SMT queries are related to multi-threading. I'll look into statically linking against OpenMP after all - I just realized that ubuntu *does* have a static libgomp.a, it's just hidden away in the ``libgcc-*-dev`` and not contained in the ``libgomp*`` packages.

Ok - linking against a static Z3 and otherwise linking dynamically (including dynamic linking against openmp), seems to be the only thing working so far.
I'll check if that holds for the PPA environment as well - we might need to compile separately for different ubuntu versions then, but that should be fine.

Nice! That method worked - https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental/+packages now contains working 0.5.10-develop PPA builds for bionic, cosmic and disco that link against the static Z3 builds in https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental-static and are otherwise dynamically linked.

It increases binary size to ~27MB (formally ~8MB), but that was expected and when we last discussed that we considered that to be still acceptable.

The only thing left to do here is to decide which repository to use for the dependencies, to add that repository as "PPA dependency" of the release repository in the launchpad settings and to change the repo address and gpg key ids in this PR. Unfortunately, I don't think I can test this, since I don't have the necessary gpg keys myself.

Sounds good! which dependencies?

@chriseth Z3! The PPA build in this PR (which builds static Z3 aka our dependency) should be in a different PPA repo than solc itself - the repo containing solc should then have that PPA repo set as "dependency" in the launchpad settings. Apart from that everything should just work, if the PPA urls and gpg keys in the PR are adjusted accordingly.

We could use https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps or create a new one.

We could of course just put the static Z3 PPA build in the same repo, but using a different one is cleaner - we only need it at build time for solc and don't want to expose it to end users (who might otherwise accidentally install our Z3 version, which might break things for them). And since the build of Z3 is static there's no need for the end user to ever see the PPA repo that contains the Z3 lib.

I'm taking this out of Draft mode - the only thing left is to choose a PPA repo to contain the static Z3 build and to add that as an "dependency PPA" to our release PPA repo.

What's the linking scheme in the end? Z3 static and GMP dyn?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2019-08-06 09:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6884#issuecomment-518587592):

The result of my last test build in my testing PPA repo is here: https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental/+files/solc_0.5.10~develop-2019-06-05-e7e700be-0ubuntu1~disco_amd64.deb.

 Z3 (and apparently GMP) are linked in statically, but OpenMP is still linked dynamically. I don't get segfaults with it this way.

Maybe we should trigger a pre-release PPA build on this branch to recheck?
To that end we could either temporarily add https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental-static (which contains a libz3-static-dev package built using the script here) to the PPA dependencies of https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-dev or go ahead and build libz3-static-dev either in https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static or in https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps and use that as PPA dep.

Also note that the binary size increases due to statically pulling in Z3, but that's to be expected.

Yea I think it'd make sense to trigger a static build/tests in this branch. From the 2 options you mentioned, which do you think makes more sense? The first one sounds easier to me

I just triggered builds for libz3-static-dev in https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps - once they have gone through we can trigger test release builds.

By the way: they seem to consider cosmic (18.04) outdated now and don't accept package uploads for it anymore.

The ``1:0.5.11~develop-2019-08-06-50fad81f-0ubuntu1~disco``  and the ``1:0.5.11~develop-2019-08-06-50fad81f-0ubuntu1~bionic`` solc builds here https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-dev were built from this PR against static Z3 and look good so far.

We should add https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps to our ubuntu docker images and install libz3-static-dev from it - then we can compile against static Z3 in our CI runs and run our tests against it. If that works out well, we should add the PPA repo as dependency repo to https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum as well and merge this PR.

It turns out, that right now we can't yet solely rely on Z3 (that was tested unsuccessfully in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7193 and is now tracked in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7196). So this is yet again blocked for now.

EDIT: solved now in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7214

As a side-note: we might want to help Debian in updating their Z3 package (see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=909494). Apparently they seem to be willing, but could use some help with it. That would be the long-term fix superceding this, since this would eventually propagate to the ubuntu releases...
