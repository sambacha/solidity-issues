Where were these tests extracted from? Can they be removed from the cpp test file(s) accordingly?

@leonardoalt ,   This has been taken from SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp. I am not sure, if I can just delete them.
Also, any test to check the sanity of above file after removing the tests.

@anurag-git The main purpose of extracting the tests is to be able to remove them from ``SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp``, so yes: please go ahead and do that - it'll also make it easier to review the extraction in the PR.

Regarding the sanity of ``SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp``: If you remove an entire ``BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(...) { ... }`` block, then you're fine. If it's only parts of the tests you can check, whether it still compiles and run ``build/test/tools/soltest`` with an instance of ``aleth`` running in the background to execute the end-to-end-tests, but I don't expect problems there and we'll see any issues in the CI tests running on the PR anyways.

Thanks, changes done and pushed.

Discussion from Gitter: this PR depends on the yet non-existing feature `alsoViaYul` that should run both with/without for the extracted tests

@anurag-git It might take a bit of time until we have a good solution for the ``ALSO_VIA_YUL`` part.

If you want to go ahead with this soon, there are two options: either you just *don't* extract tests that involve ``ALSO_VIA_YUL`` or you create *two* files for each of these tests, one regular version and one version suffixed "_via_yul", which sets
```
// ====
// compileViaYul: true
// ----
// <test expectations>
```
in the expectations (you can find examples of such tests in ``test/libsolidity/semanticsTests/viaYul/*``).

Took 2nd approach and pushed.

I'm still not sure about this solution with 2 files.
Are we going to merge them back into a single file when we have the `alsoViaYul` option?

@ekpyron , Would need your help here? I am ok with both options.

I think I'll create a way to run both kinds of tests at once after all - an imperfect, but working version will be ready shortly - I'll let you know when it's done, then you can continue based on that (sorry for the resulting delay).

@anurag-git We just merged #6916, so if you rebase this PR on top of the most current ``develop``, you'll be able to use ``compileViaYul: also`` for all the tests that have ``ALSO_VIA_YUL`` in ``SolidityEndToEndTests.cpp`` and we don't need two files, but only one. Sorry for the back and forth in this matter :-)!

I hope the changes are correct. Finally.

@anurag-git Thank you very much! One final thing before we can merge this: can you squash the PR into one single commit?
