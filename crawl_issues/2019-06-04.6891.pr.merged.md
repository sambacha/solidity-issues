# [\#6891 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6891) `merged`: Build System: Try to find Z3 using CONFIG_MODE and stock cmake files before manual search.

If Z3 is built using cmake it does produce its own cmake files which can be used to find it without a manual search - that's preferable, if available, and should help in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6884, since the Z3 provided cmake files should be aware that the build is static and automatically declare pthreads as its dependency.

We still need to fall back to manually searching for Z3 for the case that there are no Z3 provided cmake configuration files.

Hm - doesn't seem to be working yet.

Ah ok... the stock Z3 cmake files don't seem to specify their version, or at least that's why it breaks...
EDIT: hm... they do - but the fallback ``find_package`` doesn't seem to understand it...

I filed an issue with Z3: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/2318 - currently they are lacking a Z3Version.cmake file which prevents us from just passing along the version requirement. I'll look into a workaround for the time being.

Ok, the workaround is rather ugly, but it looks like it works.

@chfast could you also take a look here?
