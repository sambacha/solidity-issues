@ekpyron decided to add the exception messages properly...

It does add catches around the if/else block which didn't exist before. Malformed expressions would throw and that was not caught before.

sure, but if was caught somewhere else eventually right?

@Marenz yes all the way out, but without these checks it was impossible to know that it failed in this block since the throw comes from the library.

@ekpyron which ones would pass?
I'm also fine with having only one (`CVC4::Exception`), the same way it's done in the z3 case.

which goes back to my point: you didn't add code to catch somehing that wasn't caught before, you added code to provide a more detailed reporting about what was caught. The commit headline suggests that completely new checks were added ;)

@leonardoalt Nevermind, it's fine! However, @Marenz has a point with the commit message (I myself hardly ever look at that while reviewing, maybe that's a mistake :-)).

It doesn't say that new checks were added, whether it suggests that is up for interpretation ;)
Changed the commit message
