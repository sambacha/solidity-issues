# [\#6903 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6903) `merged`: Require gcc >= 5.0.

gcc 4.9 might work as well (it's mainly library features missing from older libstdc++, not language features missing from gcc itself I think, but for library features the minimal versions are not all that well documented as far as I can see). 5.0 should definitely be fine, though, and I don't think there's much harm in requiring it.
If we move to C++17, we'll need to increase again anyways.

Do we want and need something similar for clang? What about MSVC?

Anyways, I'd say this is a reasonable first step in any case.

Probably this should be mentioned in the docs as well - we can't just add it to the dependency list, though, since people might as well use clang... I'll open a separate issue for it.
