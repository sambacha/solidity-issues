Refs #6907, but does not close it, in case we still want to go ahead with big endian support at some point.

Damn - it seems some version combinations on travis can't compile the endianness check without enabling ``C`` as project language - I'll check what one can do.

https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/merge_requests/487 suggest they fixed it in cmake 3.9.0... as a workaround we could enable C as a language target if cmake < 3.9, but that's not particularly nice...

Stock xenial (ubuntu 16.04) still is on cmake 3.5, so we can't just increase the required version without dropping support...
