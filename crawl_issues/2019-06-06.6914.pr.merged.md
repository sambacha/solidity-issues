# [\#6914 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6914) `merged`: Use imported targets for boost and update emscripten boost to 1.70.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-06-06 15:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6914):

Closes #6913.

Requiring cmake 3.5 should be fine (it's what the oldest Ubuntu LTS version 16.04 xenial ships) and spares us more involved case distinctions.

The emscripten build needs to be updated, since the old way of overriding the boost location won't work anymore. Since we kept emscripten boost up to date recently anyways, I took the opportunity to update to 1.70 for the emscripten build.

~~Travis builds are still problematic.~~ EDIT: fixed

~~Yeah ok - that's because they ship cmake versions that are older than the respective boost version and in that case imported target won't work for boost < 1.70.
So I'll probably just have to work around all of that manually I guess...~~ EDIT: done

~~That's just great - the workaround doesn't work due to another bug in cmake, which was only fixed in 3.10 :-)...~~ EDIT: worked around

I think this should finally work now and should do so under any circumstances...

For reference: future boost versions will probably be backwards compatible (see https://github.com/boostorg/boost_install/issues/7). I'd say we should still go ahead with these changes, since it's the modern and future-proof way to do things.

It is probably wise to let someone else also review who knows cmake better

By the way this PR is actually also the proper fix for #6861 (which originally reported build issues due to boost 1.70, which were solved by asking people to downgrade boost, which I'd not consider a proper solution).

@chfast Could you have a look at least at the cmake parts?
