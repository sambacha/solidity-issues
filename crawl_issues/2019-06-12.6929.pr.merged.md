Added comments as requested. I put them in separate commits (I also changed the argument order of one of the checks to be consistent with the others), but I'll squash it together before merging.

I moved all comments to C++ comments - they shouldn't end up in and clutter generated code anyways and having comments involving ``<`` and ``>`` will confuse Whiskers :-).

Squashed a bit.

Hm... I'm still not entirely happy with the comments - currently it'll add blank lines with spaces in them to the generated IR code... I think I'll still try to solve that...

Or well... we have a lot of that going on anyways due to indenting the closing parentheses of the raw literals... so maybe it's just fine...

Closing and opening the raw strings like I did now violates the coding style a bit as well I guess...

Well, I leave it as it is for now - but I'm open to changing it if someone requests it.

Rebased. On top of this I added correctness proofs of the checks in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6944.

Will rebase this now
