# [\#6932 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6932) `merged`: Fix commandline tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-06-12 17:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6932):

The change in the test output (second commit) is merely ``shift_right_224_unsigned_petersburg`` to ``shift_right_224_unsigned`` which was missed in #6909, because the command line test script didn't report the failing test as a proper error.
