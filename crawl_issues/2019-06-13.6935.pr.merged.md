# [\#6935 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6935) `merged`: Add optimization rule SUB(~0, X) -> NOT(X).

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-06-13 09:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6935):

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6929. ``SUB(~0, X)`` is likely to occur in overflow checked arithmetic, if we don't add case-distinctions between short and full integer types.
In some sense, it's the symmetric rule for ``ADD(0,X)->X``.

~~The correctness of the rule is proven in https://github.com/leonardoalt/solidity_proofs/pull/5.~~ We moved the proofs to our repo now, so the correctness proof is now in this PR in the second commit.

The main thing to consider here is how this interacts with other rules. But ``simplificationRuleListPart8`` doesn't have rules for ``SUB(A,X)`` yet anyways - surprisingly I don't see *any* rule matching the pattern ``SUB(<CONSTANT>, ...)`` whatsoever (except the trivial constant subtraction rule ``SUB(A,B)->A-B``), so given that this will do no harm.

We should consider adding rules like ``SUB(A, SUB(B, X)) -> ADD(A-B, X)`` as well, though.

We might also want to check whether we can add more rules involving ``NOT(X)`` as further improvement.

Rebased and added proof.

That formal proof thing looks pretty cool! :+1:

Should we also add some tests? Or are existing tests already covering this?
