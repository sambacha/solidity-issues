# [\#6938 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6938) `merged`: Set state mutability of function type members ``gas`` and ``value`` to pure.

Closes #6901.

The ``gas`` and ``value`` members themselves do not change state or even read from state - they just return another function type and in that sense are pure just like addition is pure.
The function type they *return* has always correctly inherited the state mutability of the original function, so no change needed there, but I added some tests.

Tests need an EVM version rule
