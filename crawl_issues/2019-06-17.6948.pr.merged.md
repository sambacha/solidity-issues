This PR is a cherry-pick of #6681 but fixing the Windows builds by reducing the parser recursion limit from 2590 down to 1200.

The reason for the windows' stack size depth issue is that adding try-catch blocks also increases stack frame size (at least when compiling with MSVC, we didn't test others)
