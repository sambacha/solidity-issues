### Description

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5858 which I opened as this came up a couple of times during the style fixes. It turned out there wasn't much to clarify, so this makes a few tweaks to anywhere that public state variables are mentioned in docs.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [x] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
