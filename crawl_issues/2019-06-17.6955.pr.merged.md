### Description

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5673 by adding a warning that enums are only supported since 0.5.0. As this was an older issue, it may be that it's not needed anymore as 0.5.0 has been out for a little while now.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [x] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
