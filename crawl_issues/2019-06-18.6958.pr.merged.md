# [\#6958 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6958) `merged`: Fix incorrect abi encoding of storage array of data type that occupy multiple storage slots

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-06-18 12:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6958):

### Description

Please see the report for details.

Note that `uint256[][]` and `uint256[][2]` do not even compile at this moment, so they are not included in the test. I will include them in the test at #6881 . (So this PR and #6881 somewhat depends on each other)

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [x] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [ ] Used meaningful commit messages

Ah sorry, should have mentioned that earlier:

This needs an entry in the buglist (`doc/bugs.json`). Maybe something like the following:
```
    {
        "name": "StorageArrayABIEncoderV2",
        "summary": "Storage arrays containing structs or other arrays are not read properly when directly encoded in function calls or in abi.encode*.",
        "description": "When storage arrays whose elements occupy more than a single storage slot are directly encoded in function calls or using abi.encode*, their elements are read in an overlapping manner, i.e. the element pointer is not properly advanced between reads. This is not a problem when the storage data is first copied to a memory variable.",
        "introduced": "0.4.16",
        "fixed": "0.5.10",
        "severity": "low",
        "conditions": {
            "ABIEncoderV2": true
        }
    },

```

Seems like there are two entries (`ABIEncoderV2PackedStorage`, `ABIEncoderV2PackedStorage_0.4.x`) for the previous abiencoderv2 bug, do we also need to add two entries this time?

Oh I guess it depends on whether we will backport this bugfix to 0.4.x version
