I'm getting "Invalid Stack Deposit" errors now.

I know this test is failing `solidity/test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/medium.yul` but I am unable to reproduce the failure in `solc/solc --strict-assembly test.yul`.

Also, I am not sure how can I get a full error trace. Then I can figure out which function is calling `expectDeposit` (which is raising this error).

I am getting test failures like `Invalid stack height at end of block` and `Negative stack difference for variable`

I'm closing this for now. It might be easier to implement in a separate module that performs assignment of variables to stack slots and that one will be easier once we get rid of the fixed stack height assignment in the analysis.
