 ## Description

This issue tracks discussion happened at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6881#discussion_r289808363 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6965

The following line's `_arrayType.memoryHeadSize()` should be changed to `_arrayType.baseType()->memoryHeadSize()`
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ae273ff3bda86df699ab00185e2c409bad128d4a/libsolidity/codegen/ArrayUtils.cpp#L1060

I quickly looked though the implementation of `memoryHeadSize()` in `libsolidity/ast/Types.h` and `libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp`, and looks like it always return 32 (either because it is a reference type or because its `calldataEncodedSize(true)` is 32). But there are two things confuses me:

1.
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ae273ff3bda86df699ab00185e2c409bad128d4a/libsolidity/ast/Types.h#L581
Not sure why it want to return 0 when `m_bytes` is 0? (although `m_bytes` cannot be 0 in the first place)

2.
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ae273ff3bda86df699ab00185e2c409bad128d4a/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L2781-L2787

Why this strange formulae?

1) `m_bytes` was allowed to be zero in earlier versions.
2) the strange formula rounds to the next multiple of 32 - it might have just been copy-pasted for this special case.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
