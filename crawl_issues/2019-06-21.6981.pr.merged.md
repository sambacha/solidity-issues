### Description

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3849 this updates the example, but regarding https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3849#issuecomment-396665015 I can't seem to find a section that mentions default values. If this is missing I'll create a separate issue, but maybe I just couldn't find it.

@chriseth fixed formatting issue and added mention of default value in a few places. I actually would like to create a separate PR that makes the mention of default values a little more consistent, as at the moment they're a bit scattered.
