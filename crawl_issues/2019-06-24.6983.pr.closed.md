# [\#6983 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6983) `closed`: [Do not merge] Fix nested array copy from calldata to storage

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-06-24 09:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6983):

### Description

This PR is similar to #6881 , but fixes nested calldata dynamic array's assignment to storage. (#6881 fixes assignment to memory)

The `Changelog.md` update reflects both this PR and #6881 's change.

I only tested some basic cases so please review carefully.

By the way, the codegen of other dynamic types that need calldata tail pointer access are guarded by `solUnimplementedAssert`, and for array types it should always cause stack height assertion failure (because calldata dynamic array's length is also stored on stack). So the bug fixed by these 2 PRs probably did not lead to vulnerability in previous compiler releases.

### Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles correctly
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [ ] Used meaningful commit messages

I'd like to request another review by @ekpyron before this can be merged.

I think it would still be better to wait for you to return.

(just forced-pushed to rebase)

Force pushed to address an issue about I incorrectly assumed dynamically encoded array must be dynamically sized. (Which is not true during codegen 3-dimensional array assignment)

But there are still an issue about source pointer advancement, described in #7072

@sifmelcara Now that https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7178 is merged, we could rebase this and check whether it solves the issue with three-dimensional arrays!

:tada: It now passes after rebase.
Now what remained to be done is to rebase again after 0.5.11 release (because of changelog.md) and squash commits.

The failing test in the t_ubu_asan_constantinople may be unrelated to this PR and rather due to the macros disabling that check in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7010 not working...

We decided that we don't want to properly implement this for the old ABIEncoder, but instead want to push ABIEncoderV2 forward, so I'm closing this. I'll open a new issue for improving error messages in these cases.
