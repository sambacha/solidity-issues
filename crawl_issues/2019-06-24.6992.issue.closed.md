# [\#6992 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6992) `closed`: [Yul] Word size transform for switch

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2405:

Statements of the form `switch x case "..." { ... } ... default { ... }` need to be transformed from 256 bit to 64 bit.

One solution would be to change it to an if - elseif - chain, but we do not have `else` (that's what we have switch for...).

Another solution would be to just transform it into nested switch statements:

```
switch x_1 case "<highest 64 bits of first case>" {
    switch x_2 case "<second highest 64 bits of first case>" {
    ...
    }
    ...
}
```

The problem with that one is that we still have to do something about the default case. Probably the best way would be to use such a hierarchical switch transform (which also degrades nicely if all cases are small numbers) and add an additional variable that is set to `1` in the 'default' cases of the leaves. After all the switches, there is an additional `if <flag> { <default body> }`.
