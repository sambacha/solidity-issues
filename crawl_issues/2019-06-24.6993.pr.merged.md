# [\#6993 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6993) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Remove overflow check for assignments

The removed checks should be done explicitly where the targets are created.
The only use case at the moment was for unary inc/dec, so the overflow check was moved there.
The same should be done for type conversion in the future.
This is part of the refactoring.
