# [\#6994 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6994) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Delay all checks

Depends on #6993 

This PR adds code that delays all checks to end the of the function except for constant conditions which need to be checked on the fly.

In order to do that, this code
- adds a more general VerificationTarget removing OverflowTarget
- uses the assertion stack from EncodingContext
- makes functions `checkCondition` and `checkBooleanNotConstant` almost free, using only `m_interface` from the class

It's hard to separate these things in different PRs because they are intertwined, so hopefully this PR is reviewable as it is.

File SMTChecker.cpp has many changes but most of them are local and quite simple
