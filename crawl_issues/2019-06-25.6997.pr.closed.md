There still seem to be some problems here. Did you try to compile locally?

Nope, I keep getting an error when running `./scripts/tests.sh`. The Failing CI logs, however, consistently produce these errors `error: no matching function for call to â€˜regex_replace`. After reading [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24990646/how-do-i-use-regex-replace), It appears that the compiler should be updated to GCC 4.9 to remove the errors.

It looks like stdc++ does not support regex_replace where the replacement is performed by a lambda function. So you would have to write some glue code. This might be more complicated than I initially though - sorry about that!

No problem:smile:. I am closing this PR, since I have some troubles with the testing.
