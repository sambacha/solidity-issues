# [\#7001 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7001) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Split SMTChecker file into different components

Depends on #6994 

Splits SMTChecker into
- ModelChecker, the entry point from CompilerStack. Contains EncodingContext and manages verification engines.
- SMTEncoder, does not decide on control-flow and verification targets, simply encodes simple expressions
- BMC (Bounded Model Checker), decides control-flow and creates/checks verification targets accordingly.

Most of the changes in this PR are code being removed from SMTChecker (now SMTEncoder) into BMC.

The functions in `BMC.h/cpp` that are not visitors were taken out of `SMTChecker`.
The visitors follow a similar structure from the encoding visitors (in `SMTEncoder`) but only to create the relevant verification targets.
