The way evmc is included is still not satisfactory for me. Since it is "just a wrapper", I'm thinking of stripping everything that is not needed and just adding the 4 header files and single .c file into the project.

Test failure count is down to 36.

One is a weird failure in the auction registrar.

Then we have a bunch of gas cost test failures - those are probably still quite some work. I would suspect this is related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7010/files#diff-e4cd21bbaea28071e286e4adfd6ec79aR97

Finally, we have some failures related to the precompiled contracts. We probably do not want to implement everything, so this boils down to implementing some crude "simulated" version of each precompile and modifying the test expectations, I would assume.

Anyone feel free to continue working on this until Monday :)

Another reason for the gas test failures is that EVMHost maybe has to compute the data gas. @chfast - do you have any insight into this?

Host is responsible for counting refunds, unfortunately.

In Aleth:
- SSTORE: https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/blob/master/libevm/ExtVMFace.cpp#L65-L83
- There should be also one for SELFDESTRUCT, but I cannot find it around ExtVMFace.

In geth:
- SSTORE: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/17a364a55af1f8274ec72e254620ca710926d951/core/vm/evmc.go#L132-L159

Yes, we already know this should be handled by the VM, but that requires the ABI break so it will not be changed in EVMC 6.

I tried to fix it by adding `Boost::unit_test_framework` to `abiv2_proto_ossfuzz` link libraries but that complains about `error: undefined reference to 'init_unit_test_suite(int, char**)'`. May be related to newer boost library in 19.04 and this (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/obsolete_init_func.html) but I'm not sure because soltest compiles and links just fine.

The ASan failure in `b_ubu_asan_constantinople` job seems to have been fixed after increasing the timeout of `SolidityOptimizer/constant_optimization_early_exit` from 20 to 60 seconds.

@chriseth Locally, it doesn't take longer than 5 seconds. Could it be that the CI was overloaded at the time the test was run?

Update: I tested locally in both debug and release modes, and worst case execution time for the erstwhile failing test is 5 seconds.

Did you try SSH-ing into the CI and looking at it locally there? A good heuristic is to just run it with a debugger and stop it at random intervals - if you end up in the same piece of code most of the time, that's likely the problem ;-).

@ekpyron Thanks for the hint, I'll try doing that.

@chfast evmone is not instrumented with ASan

Update: The soltest binary spends a significant chunk of time in these two recursive functions

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/48262106626020435051dac51fd2e73f4a80a03f/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L391

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/48262106626020435051dac51fd2e73f4a80a03f/libevmasm/ConstantOptimiser.cpp#L188

To get a sense of how long this test takes on average, I ran it 50 times in the CI container

min execution time: 41 seconds
max execution time: 54 seconds
average (across 50 runs): 43 seconds

so I think the new timeout `60` is required. Still not sure why this test now takes > 2x previous time. Was ASan testing enabled recently? If so, the run time is reasonable because ASan usually results in a 2x slowdown compared to native speed.

The tests are not run properly, because the docker image currently only contains libevmone.a and not libevmone.so.
