# [\#7018 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7018) `merged`: Compile only requested sources and contracts

Fixes #6748 

We still need to `parse` all sources because of imports.

Sure, parsing is needed.

Can you add a changelog entry?

Also, is it possible to test this? Perhaps via commandline test?

As just discussed, I think it would be more flexible to combine the "requested sources" and "requested contracts" into a single map.

Still missing test

As discussed: The test is just a re-implementation of the existing algorithm. To allow literal test vectors, we should implement a filter that replaces explicit bytecode with a fixed string. This filter will also help other tests, so we can apply it to all commandline tests in standard-io-mode. The filter should also replace escaped newlines by actual newlines so that the expectation files are easier to review (even if they are not valid json anymore).

Re-added `-e` to all `sed` calls to see if that fixes the problem on MacOS.

Tests passing now in all platforms.
Question now is if we want to keep this workaround or try to fix the expression without `-E`.

It turns out that `sed -i -e` does the following on mac os: It treats `-e` as the suffix to add to the backup file. Since `-e` is optional, it executes the script nevertheless.

So maybe we should fix that properly at some point by always adding a backup suffix...
