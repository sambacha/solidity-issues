Will add tests, but first I'll write an auto-updating framework for abi json tests.

The main question here is if we want to add that info even if it is the same and if the name is right.

@chriseth This is great, i love the fact that it covers all types not just structs (enums). 

Regarding your comment on don't output when type == internal, that is a hard one. Probably output both. Hard to come up with a simple name for "mapsToInternalType" that will remove the need.

Why the name `internalType`? Internal to what exactly?

Internal as in "internal to solidity" in contrast to public / external as in "part of the ABI".

My intention was to introduce an annotation which is still well specified so it doesn't become "internal to Solidity".

@axic ok, but would that be a language-independent specification? If so, why not just change the ABI?

@axic what about `typeDetail` or `detailedType`?

I'm a fan of always listing the internal type, even if it matches the encoded type.  Much simpler to write a tool that only cares about the internal type that way.  No need to do special handling for "if internalType is missing ...".

@axic we also have to consider that the type specified - in case of structs or enums - is a name _internal_ to the source code. It references a type by name that is further defined in the source code.

Can it even be language independent? Those types are Solidity internal. Unless the ABI simply copies Solidity types.

We might want to prepend `contract `, `struct `, and `enum ` in front of the types.

Prepending `contract `, `enum ` and `struct ` seems to make this feature even more complete. I like how the internal type maps to the (external) type.
```
...
"indexed": false,
"internalType": "struct C.T",
"name": "t",
"type": "tuple"
...
```

Changed the way types are represented. Please check!
