**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

The following contract compiles without error: 

```solidity
contract A {
    int x;
}

contract B is A {
    function f() public pure {
        A.x = 5;
    }
}
```

Function f is marked as pure but modifies the state. Shouldn't this be reported as a compile error?

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.9+commit.c68bc34e.Darwin.appleclang
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce

Run compiler on above contract.
