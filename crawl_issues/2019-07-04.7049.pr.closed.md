I really don't like this unversioned import of evmc. What is the reason against using subtrees?

It's not just unversioned, it is an extremely slimmed down version that removes tons of CMake lines.

Argh, I had this `ar: no archive members specified` before on Linux. Adding `C` as a language helped, but not on MacOS. I guess the actual error here is that we have an object without content, is that right?

Can you explain why is this needed and how evmc could be improved to avoid the need for this? cc @chfast

evmc is almost header-only, I don't see why so much cmake code is needed to make it work.

I tried for some time to configure it as a cmake subdirectory but could not make it work in the end.

The problem afaiu is that we are invoking `ar` against a file (`libevmone.a`) that does not exist. Why `libevmone.a` is not getting built before the invocation of the `ar` command is an independent problem :-)
