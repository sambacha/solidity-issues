### Description
closes #6710 by moving the YulUtilFunctions::suffixedVariableNameList() function to the already existing ```libdevcore/StringUtils.h``` (which seemed more appropriate than creating a new file in ```liblangutil```).

EDIT:
- I also changed how the function is imported in the fuzzer in ```test/tools/ossfuzz/protoYul.cpp``` as suggested by @ekpyron [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6710#issuecomment-490871061) 
and updated the depency in there from ```namespace dev::solidity``` to ```namespace dev```
 

### Checklist

- [x] All tests are passing (true for ``` ../scripts/soltest.sh --no-ipc --no-smt```)
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary

also I don't understand the output of ```scripts/check_style.sh```. It seems like every single line i wrote has an error in it. I only copied those around, so maybe my editor is using the wrong setting for indentation somehow (setting: tabs are spaces, width 8). 

But I don't see that in the output (or anything else that might give me a clue):

EDIT: **resolved**

You should use tab to indent, instead of space :)

Good to see you again, @djudjuu ! Indeed, StringUtils.h seems like the better choice. Please change spaces to tabs.
