**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

### Description

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1303.

`TypeChecker` now allows raising signed integers, an example:

```solidity
function() external { uint x = 3; int y = -4; y ** x; }
```

Thank you for your contribution! Could you please explain the rules about the types better? I think the resulting type should always at least include the type of the base - is that the case? It might even be better to just use the same rules as we use for the shift operator. What do you think?

My intention about the type-widening is:

`uint` base + `int` exponent = `invalid`
`int` base + `int` exponent = `invalid`
`uint_Wb` base + `uint_We` exponent = `uint_max(Wb, We)`
`int_Wb` base + `uint_We` exponent = `int_max(Wb, We)`

Where `Wb` and `We` are bit widths of the base and the exponent correspondingly.

Examples:
`uint x = 3; int y = -4; y ** x` -> `int`
`uint16 x = 3; int8 y = -4; y ** x` -> `int16`
`uint16 x = 3; uint16 y = -4; y ** x` -> `uint16`
`uint32 x = 3; uint16 y = -4; y ** x` -> `uint32`

For symmentic operators, treating both types equally makes sense. For the exponentiation, I would say that the result type should either always be the type of the base or it should be the type that can hold the result value in the worst case - although we don't do the latter for other operators.

Updated and rebased. Still needs semantics tests.

... especially with dirty data.

The warning is not produced for `uint8**int8` - which was not possible before.
