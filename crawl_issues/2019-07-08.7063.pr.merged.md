# [\#7063 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7063) `merged`: Extracting more end-to-end tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-07-08 14:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7063):

* ~ 667 lines deleted
* ~ 478 lines added
* 25 tests in 2 hours;

It took overall longer than expected (for "just" 25) tests, so the learning was: While a few tests are easy to port, some required discussion while extracting, as not everything was very obvious.

Extraction rate should increase over time as more features to the new semantic tests framework are being added (see #6669), where we added a few more TODO items.
