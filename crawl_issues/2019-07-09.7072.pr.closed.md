# [\#7072 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7072) `closed`: ArrayType::calldataEncodedSize() should return size of pointer for dynamically encoded types

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-07-09 14:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7072):

### Description

I discovered this issue when writing 3-dimensional array test for #6983 , and it turns out #6983 is indeed problematic when assigning 3 dimensional array. (thankfully @ekpyron suggested to test 3 dimensional array).

The problem happens when an array's base type is `uint256[][2]`, that base type's `calldataEncodedSize()` will incorrectly return 64, then we advance source pointer by 64 bytes and corrupt the source pointer. (We should only advance 32 bytes).

But the fix included in this PR makes some runtime test failing, and the reason does not look obvious to me.

What is the correct value of calldataEncodedSize() of uint256[][2]?
According to comments in libsolidity/Types.h, it should be 32 because it is dynamic type. But it currently returns 64.
But if I "fix" the implementation of calldataEncodedSize() to let it return 32, there will be 4~5 runtime test failing
(And the reason of test failure is not obvious to me)

@sifmelcara calldataEncodedSize should only be used for statically-encoded types. Still, maybe we should make it work for both. Which tests are failing?
There are some places in the code that call isDynamicallySized when they should actually call isDynamicallyEncoded, because that only really makes a difference if ABIEncoderV2 is active.

mingchuan @sifmelcara 21:54
Tests related to encoding/decoding of nested array are failing
Why calldataEncodedSize should only be used for statically-encoded types? https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.h#L211-L213 Here it says it should return the size of pointer

chriseth @chriseth 22:00
@sifmelcara can you check if changing Types.cpp:1655 from if (isDynamicallySized()) to if (isDynamicallyEncoded()) fixes it?
or is that what you mean by fix?

mingchuan @sifmelcara 22:00
Yes, that is what I mean by fix
```

Ok, this hopefully fixes it.

I'm not entirely convinced by this change - the size of ``uint256[2]`` or ``struct S { uint256 a; uint256 b; }``, when encoded in calldata *is* 64 bytes after all, regardless of whether the type occurs in dynamically or statically encoded form. And I'd need to really carefully look through everything to convince myself that everything depending on ``calldataEncodedSize`` working like that is treated/changed in this PR... Should this rather be split into ``calldataDataSize`` and ``calldataHeadSize`` similar to the memory functions? Would ``calldataDataSize`` actually be used anywhere? In general I was never really happy with the various size functions in the type system... for which types are which ``memory*Size``s and the calldata sizes actually different? I can look into this in more detail, once I'm back, but it'll still be a while until then...

EDIT: hm...both example I had above are never dynamically encoded... and probably none of the types for which this changes ``calldataEncodedSize`` can e.g. be directly copied from calldata using ``calldatacopy`` anyways, for which this could otherwise have been problematic... maybe it's actually fine - I'll need to have another look, though.

@ekpyron yeah, you are right - this is tricky and we somehow need a way to discover the size of the calldata data area...

Just to confirm whether I understand this correctly and didn't miss something: the reason of test failure is misuse of `calldataEncodedSize()` when allocate memory for statically-sized-dynamically-encoded array/struct.

I'm leaning towards not changing the implementation of the function and rather renaming it or at least updating the documentation.

An example test case where this currently fails is the following (the first two calls succeed as desired, but the third doesn't fail due to this PR):
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract C {
    function f(uint256[][2][] calldata x) external returns (uint256) {
        x[0]; // trigger bounds checks
        return 23;
    }
}
// ----
// f(uint256[][2][]): 0x20, 0x01, 0x20, 0x40, 0x60, 0x00, 0x00 -> 23 # this is the common encoding for x.length == 1 && x[0][0].length == 0 && x[0][1].length == 0 #
// f(uint256[][2][]): 0x20, 0x01, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00 -> 23 # exotic, but still valid encoding #
// f(uint256[][2][]): 0x20, 0x01, 0x20, 0x00 -> FAILURE # invalid (too short) encoding, but no failure due to this PR #
```

When checking that the supplied calldata is large enough for ``x[0]``, the check now verifies that there are ``32*length = 32 * 1 = 32`` more bytes in calldata, since ``calldataEncodedSize`` of ``uint256[][2]`` is now 32. However, it should check, if there are ``64*length = 64*1 = 64`` more bytes.

This corresponds to the ``// TODO this might make a difference`` comment in L1206 of the PR. There should be a similar problem with the other TODO comment - I'll try to construct a test case for that one as well.

This shows already, that there *is* a problem, but we still have to decide how to deal with this. We'll probably have to split ``calldataEncodedSize`` into two functions (for head and data size) and consequently rethink how ``calldataStride`` is implemented. Or does anyone have a better/cleaner solution?

Ah, ok, the test case above will fail in ``abiDecodingFunctionCalldataArray``. The other ``TODO`` is in ``calldataAccessFunction``, which is only used when encoding from calldata, so for that one to fail, we can use the following test (for which again the third call will incorrectly not fail with this PR):

```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract C {
    function f(uint256[][2][] calldata x) external returns (uint256) {
        return 42;
    }
    function g(uint256[][2][] calldata x) external returns (uint256) {
        return this.f(x);
    }
}
// ----
// g(uint256[][2][]): 0x20, 0x01, 0x20, 0x40, 0x60, 0x00, 0x00 -> 42
// g(uint256[][2][]): 0x20, 0x01, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00 -> 42
// g(uint256[][2][]): 0x20, 0x01, 0x20, 0x00 -> FAILURE
```

@sifmelcara We will refactor and split up ``calldataEncodedSize()`` into several functions (we already discovered another bug related to dynamically-encoded structs related to this) - if you don't mind, I'll take over this PR and implement this here - hopefully, it won't take me too long.

@ekpyron thanks! please feel free to take over. Could you ping me before merging this PR though? so I can test this and make sure this indeed fixes #6983 's 3 dimensional array case.

@sifmelcara I think the changes in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7178 are almost ready and mainly require review - feel free to comment on the splitting of ``calldataEncodedSize`` there and to let us know, whether you think it's helpful and the code comments are sufficient - I'll let you know when we merge.
