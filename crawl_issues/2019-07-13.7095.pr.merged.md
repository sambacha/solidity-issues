# [\#7095 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7095) `merged`: [isoltest] Support FAILURE with reason

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2019-07-13 23:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7095):

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6669.

### Desctiption ###
This PR adds parsing and formatting support for e.g. revert reasons that were returned by the call:
```
contract C {
    function e() public {
        revert("Transaction failed.");
    }
}
// ====
// EVMVersion: >homestead
// ----
// _() -> FAILURE
// e() -> FAILURE, hex"08c379a0", 0x20, 19, "Transaction failed."
```
It also splits up the smoke tests for `isoltest` and includes a small refactoring towards a cleaner and safer formatting of results returned from calls.

Sounds good! Don't you need to add additional info to signal that `hex"08c379a0"` is not padded?

The "workflow" I had in mind implies, that you would see the actual result returned by the call once (added with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7052). This based on my guess, that you won't pre-compute the signature before writing a test which means that would probably start off with:

`// e() -> FAILURE, hex"00", 0x00, "Transaction failed."`

which prints the actual returned bytes:

```
Obtained result:
// e() -> FAILURE, hex"08c379a0", 0x20, 13, "Transaction failed."

Warning: the call to "f()" returned
[08,c3,79,a0]
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20]
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13]

```
and that should make it clear, that the signature is not padded. Does this makes sense to you?

Does this mean that not padding it is a special case for this situation or not? Do we pad `hex"..."` in other situations or not?

@chriseth No padding for `hex"..."` is the default and works with function arguments and with expectations that actually return unpadded bytes (like in this PR). We had no test cases that tested functions returning unpadded results before.

Formatting fails when target type is a (unpadded) hex string or a (right-aligned, padded) hex number and the actual result is left-aligned and padded.

Ah, ok. The wrong formatting of left-aligned, padded bytes for target type hex number will be fixed with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7091.

Then, I think we should merge https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7052 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7091 first.

Ok, then it's fine for this PR. Have we talked about requiring `unpadded(...)` in such cases?

@chriseth What's the difference between `unpadded(0xEF0042)` and `hex"EF0042"`? Would you prefer to also have `unpadded(...)` for padded types like hexadecimals?

Rebased and updated. I took care of all comments except from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7095/files#r304959011, which seems to be also out-of-scope.

Not sure how we decidid that in the past, but currently, I would assume everything to be padded unless explicitly specified otherwise. Does not need to be changed in this PR, though.

@chriseth Yes, that's the case. The only exception is `hex"ef0042"`, which is not padded. I can't fully remember why we decided to favor `hex"ef0042"` over `unpadded(0xef0042)`. Maybe because `left(...)` and `right(...)` were not there yet.
