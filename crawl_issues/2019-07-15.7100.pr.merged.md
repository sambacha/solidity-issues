@chriseth I understand your last comment, and I understand the principles, but as this was the content that was already there, I'm struggling slightly to explain it better.

The pseudo syntax refers to the earlier paragraph, and I am hoping that the example (and explanation) help explain itâ€¦

OK @chriseth done!

I had to cut a fair bit out, so I hope nothing got lost in the process. @ekpyron this also cut most of the copy that we were discussing, possibly it even needs more explanation now!
