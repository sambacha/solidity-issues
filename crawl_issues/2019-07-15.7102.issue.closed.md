# [\#7102 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7102) `closed`: Solidity compiler output does not say library or not
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

There is nothing in the Solidity json output which says whether or not a contract is a library or not. This would be useful to know whether the contract needs runtime ABIs or to work around #7101.

That's a good idea! Do you think this should already belong into the ABI or into e.g. `contracts["sourceFile.sol"]["MyLibrary"]["contractKind"] = "library"`?

I'd like to see more meta data in the ABIs, like contract name, source file, and contract kind.

So you would like to see something like this?

```
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.7.0;

contract Test {
    constructor() public { b = hex"12345678901234567890123456789012"; }
    event Event(uint indexed a, bytes32 b);
    event Event2(uint indexed a, bytes32 b);
    function foo(uint a) public { emit Event(a, b); }
    bytes32 b;
}
```
would result in the JSON:
```
[{
"type":"event",
"inputs": [{"name":"a","type":"uint256","indexed":true},{"name":"b","type":"bytes32","indexed":false}],
"name":"Event",
"library": "false",
"contractName": "Test",
"sourceFile: "test.sol"
}, {
"type":"event",
"inputs": [{"name":"a","type":"uint256","indexed":true},{"name":"b","type":"bytes32","indexed":false}],
"name":"Event2",
"library": "false",
"contractName": "Test",
"sourceFile: "test.sol"
}, {
"type":"function",
"inputs": [{"name":"a","type":"uint256"}],
"name":"foo",
"outputs": [],
"library": "false",
"contractName": "Test",
"sourceFile: "test.sol"
}]
```

@ekpyron mentions that the `abi` field is very solidity agnostic and maybe shouldn't contain such programming-language specific details.

The alternative would be what @chriseth suggested or to put it in the `metadata` object.

To be fair this looks messy. Maybe it does belong in the metadata object.

As name and file are already in the json that would mean I simply add a new field containing the library info in the metadata, maybe like this?

`contracts["sourceFile.sol"]["MyLibrary"]["metadata"]["library"] = "true"`

I think we should stick to ``contractKind`` being ``contract`` or ``library`` - that's what we do in the JSON AST and it's more future-proof.

We now closed the PR for this, since we think that this information belongs in the json AST (where it already can be found). Otherwise we need a clear criterion for which information from the AST should be replicated in the metadata. If you see any hard disadvantages for referring this to the AST, please comment!

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
