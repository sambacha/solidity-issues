### Description

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3850 where we have now undertaken most of the tasks here already, but I felt we could add details of our team calls, not necessary though. The testing tasks remain to be completed, but am waiting for changes before diving back into that.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [x] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Looks like the ossfuzz build CI is failing because the PR is not rebased, could you please rebase as well?
