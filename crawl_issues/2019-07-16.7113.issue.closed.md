# [\#7113 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7113) `closed`: Logging state variables in constructor prevents deployment

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161566?u=96fa92029184b2a4662eba932c535f39d9d29f1d&v=4" width="50">[ethernomad](https://github.com/ethernomad) opened issue at [2019-07-16 19:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7113):

## Description

Passing a state variable to an event in contact constructor prevents contract deployment.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.10
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): byzantium
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): dapp / none
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: MIX Blockchain
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

https://github.com/mix-blockchain/mix-account/blob/4dfdbcde79787465c88f6c017326c036ffc74119/src/MixAccount.sol#L81

```
dapp build --extract
```

Then try to deploy MixAccount.bin - it is reverted by the EVM.

Changing that line to
```
emit SetController(msg.sender);
```
fixed the problem.

Triggering code:
```
    address payable controller;

    event SetController(address controller);

    constructor() public {
        // Store the controller.
        controller = msg.sender;
        // Log the event.
        emit SetController(controller);
    }
```

Can you use a debugger to see where exactly it fails? It looks to me like the execution environment you are using does not support the EVM version set in the compiler.

Can you point me in the direction of how to debug this? It only fails on the blockchain.

When I run the tests in Hevm it works fine: https://dapp.tools/hevm/

Here is the blockchain config:
https://github.com/mix-blockchain/mix-blockchain/blob/master/mix.json
So it is byzantium EVM and I compile the contract for byzantium.

This deployment reversion does not cause a chain split between Geth and Parity.

You can debug it by analyzing the trace. There are multiple debugging tools out there.

Please reopen if you can find more details about the failure.
