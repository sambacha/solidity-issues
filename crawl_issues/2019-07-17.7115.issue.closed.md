I think we should make the tests work on windows in general and then look at moving from appveyor to circleci.

@chriseth I think this ticket can be closed as soon as https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9476 is merged, because it also makes sure EVMONE is being downloaded & used when running soltest.

True, no longer an issue!
