# [\#7118 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7118) `closed`: Define side-effect-free-ness
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

We need the concept of side-effect-free-ness for several use-cases:

 - enforce side-effect-free-ness in expressions for invariants and other verification uses
 - warn about side-effect-free expression statements
 - warn about multiple expressions with side-effects in the same statement where the order of execution is not totally obvious

These three concepts of side-effect-free-ness might be different. They are all different from pure-ness, because pure expression can have side-effects on memory.

Also, the concepts of side-effect-free-ness above do not have to mean that the expressions have zero effects on memory: Allocating a new memory array could be considered side-effect-free, but maybe this could be better handled in a lifetime or usage tracking module.

Actually, this is also related: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2691#issuecomment-517326454 - if we warn about *all* (i.e. also non-pure) side-effect-free statements that workaround won't work anymore. Put differently: is changing the strictest state-mutability another kind of side-effect or not?

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
