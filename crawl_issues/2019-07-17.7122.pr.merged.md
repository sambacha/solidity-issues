### Description

Fix #6866

Actually I guess it makes some sense to white-list builtins that takes no argument

Please take a look at the Rematerializer, it uses one of the metrics to determine whether it is fine to duplicate expressions - including builtins. Note that for instance the opcode `calldatasize()` is actually even cheaper than referencing a local variable.

@sifmelcara @chriseth I tested the timeout issue and it does not reproduce with this PR
