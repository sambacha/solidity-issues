error recovery is desired.

Fixes #7085

### Description

If option `--error-recovery` is given (or `parserErrorRecovery` is set in StandardCompiler) we warn but do not stop if there is a pragma mismatch.

### Checklist

- [x ] All tests are passing (there was a SMT failure that seems to have nothing to do with this PR)
- [x ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)

Can you add another test that does not produce a parser error in recovery mode and thus proves that the syntax checker really produces the error?

Hmm.. The version number in the error message needs to be ignored by the test. So more work is needed.

Ok I think f9b631f tests things properly now. There had been a pragma version mismatch test. It ignores the second error because the first pragma message fails. So the new test with error recovery does the opposite and ensures that the _next_ error message is reported skipping the program mismatch error.

Did you add that test: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7123#issuecomment-512552565 ?

I meant a test that is run in recovery mode and thus skips the error generation about the pragma in the parser. Further parsing errors should not be present in the test, so that we see that the syntax checker produces the error.

There is a misunderstanding here that I tried to ward off by the explanation in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7123#issuecomment-512600434.

The test linked  _is_ run in recovery mode and the program error is skipped which is why we see the second error message instead of the first one. Notice that the test right above it `unsatisfied_version_followed_by_invalid_syntax()` is almost identical and it is testing that we _don't_ get to the second error message like we do in this test.

Ah ok sorry, I did not notice the test above.
