# [\#7133 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7133) `merged`: [SMTChecker] CHC basic loop support

Depends on #7132 #7107 #7121 

This PR adds basic support to `while`, `dowhile` and `for` loops in the CHC engine.
The encoding is:
Let `f_i` the function block before the loop. Create the following blocks:
- `loop_header`, containing constraints created by the condition (potential side effect statements).
- `loop_body`, containing constraints from the loop body.
- `f_j`, the function block after the loop
Create the following edges:
- `f_i -> loop_header`
- `loop_header -> loop_body`
- `loop_header -> f_j`
- `loop_body -> loop_header`, if there were no nested loops inside this loop body.
- `f_k -> loop_header`, f_k -> loop_header, if there was at least one nested loop inside this loop body, where `f_k` is the function body block after the latest nested loop.

For now `break` and `continue` are unsupported and erase all knowledge, including local variables.
`for` statements will have a similar behavior but it'll be added in a different PR.

It'd be nice to add more tests, even though some false positives from the current tests were already removed.

This can be reviewed, though it still lacks a solution for tests that behave differently with/without CHC.

Generally I wonder whether this can be simplified with some commonly shared helper functions and some more fine-grained state...
Something like keeping a member ``m_currentBlock`` which is initialized to the interface block and connected to a function body block via a function entry block in the FuntionDefinition visit - then each visit just appends to the current block, if no control flow split occurs - and if a split occurs it creates new blocks and connects them from the current block according to control flow, merging them to a single block that becomes the new ``m_currentBlock`` afterwards... The only exception being the FunctionDefinition endVisit, which connects the current block back to interface and resets ``m_currentBlock`` to the interface block... That's basically what the ControlFlowBuilder does and I think that's much easier to read - but I'm not sure whether that method fits here exactly... But to me it would seem that all the stuff here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7133#discussion_r319976252 could just be part of a "connectBlocks" function...
But yeah - maybe we should talk about what I mean exactly and whether it's worse yet another run of refactoring...

I need to understand what exactly that would mean. Reading the message I
can only think that that'd exactly what it's already being done.

Also, I don't really want if blocks to be separate blocks. Some experiments
I ran gave worse invariants when using small blocks, so I'd like to stick
to large blocks.

Yeah, I'll need to take another look - I'm pretty sure it's basically indeed what you're already doing, but I think defining a handful of helper functions that do the recurring parts could probably make it much easier to read.

Yea I do see the general pattern. But each case has something a little different, like an extra constraint, the `from` predicate, the SSA indices. I could refactor those into a new function, the question is whether the extra tweaks would be worth it.

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm not exactly sure about - if it's too many tweaks, then it will only in fact complicate things in the end... But if it was e.g. possible to hide away the SSA indices completely and find a good abstraction for providing the from predicate, then it might make things much easier...

```
connectBasicControlFlowBlocks(from, to, (optional) precondition = {})
{
       auto antecedant = from && m_context.assertions();
       if (precondition)
              antecedant &&= *precondition;
	smt::Expression bodyEdge = smt::Expression::implies(
		loopHeader && m_context.assertions() && condition,
		predicateBodyCurrent(to)
	);
	addRule(bodyEdge, &_loop, &_body);
}
```

It's mostly something like that, right?

I'd imagine things (very roughly) to look like this in the end:
```
bool CHC::visit(ForStatement const& _for)
{
	if (auto init = _for.initializationExpression())
		init->accept(*this);

        auto loopCondition = createNewBasicControlFlowBlock();
        auto loopPostIncrement = createNewBasicControlFlowBlock();
        auto loopBody = createNewBasicControlFlowBlock();
        auto afterLoop = createNewBasicControlFlowBlock();

        connectBasicControlFlowBlocks(m_currentBlock, loopCondition);

        m_currentBlock = loopCondition;

        _for.condition()->accept(*this);

         connectBasicControlFlowBlocks(loopCondition, loopBody, expr(&_for.condition());
         connectBasicControlFlowBlocks(loopCondition, afterLoop, !expr(&_for.condition());

         m_continueDest = loopPostIncrement;
         m_breakDest = afterLoop;
         m_currentBlock = loopBody;
         _for.body()->accept(this); // might advance m_currentBlock

         connectBasicControlFlowBlocks(m_currentBlock, loopPostIncrement);
         m_currentBlock = loopPostIncrement;
         _for.loopExpression()->accept(*this);

         connectBasicControlFlowBlock(m_currentBlock, loopCondition);

        m_currentBlock = afterLoop;

	return false;
}
```

This way you can just read it line by line and really follow the control flow, don't you agree? And this should be possible, right? And especially since break and continue will be very easy to implement like this I'd actually not use a common "visitLoop", but handle their control flow explicitly for each loop kind - the ``while`` and ``do...while`` visits should be much simpler...

But yeah, I hope you're not tired of me asking for refactoring on this ;-)...

EDIT: maybe that would need a simple helper struct that actually represents a basic control flow block, which will basically be a node pointer with a specific SSA index or sth like that? But that should be fine as well, right? I haven't thought all that through completely - I just want to see if you think this is feasible and agree that it's better - otherwise we should go a different direction or leave things as they are...

This PR was refactored.

@ekpyron now it looks a lot closer to what you requested ;)
To discuss:

- Maybe change how `predicateCurrent` and `predicateBodyCurrent` work. It'd be nice to not have that distinction, but the problem there is that the Interface and function predicates require a different set of arguments compared to blocks inside functions. Interface takes only state variables and functions take state variables and their input/output variables. This can also be done in another PR.

- Sometimes we need to call `connectBlocks` without appending `m_context.assertions()`. We can `pushSolver` before and `popSolver` after, as it's done currently in `endVisit(FunctionDefinition)`, but maybe there's a better way.

- I would still keep function `visitLoop`, since both `visit(WhileStatement)` and `visit(ForStatement)` would probably have a similar size and we could avoid code repetition.

There are currently two tests failing:

- A loop test that Z3 4.8.5 (latest release, also used in our tests) times out, but nightly solves it. I could either remove the test or try to make it work with some changes in the modular arithmetic encoding.

- An array test that fails now after rebase. My suspicion is the PR that added `const_array`s.

@ekpyron I guess you could start the next review while I look into the tests.

Still missing proper tests for `break` and `continue`.

The only actual change after discussions was the `predicate` stuff.
