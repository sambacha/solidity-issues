# [\#7141 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7141) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Reset SSA index to 0 instead of increasing in context reset

Now with a CHC run before the BMC run the SSA indices for variables `this` and `balances` were increased in `EncodingContext::reset` before `BMC`, which works fine if using Z3. Using only CVC4 without Z3 causes the CHC *not* to run, thus the SSAs were not increased and the queries looked different for this case.

This PR makes sure the indices are zeroed which fixes that problem.
