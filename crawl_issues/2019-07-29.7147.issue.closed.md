## Abstract

Inspired by #7114 

Let `T1`, `T2`,..., `Tn` be arbitrary types. Let `e1`, `e2`, ..., `en` be expressions of the said types respectively.

`abi.encode(e1, e2, ..., en)`  returns their encoding as a value (let's call it `encodedBytes`) of type `bytes`

Now

`(T1 v1, T2 v2, ..., Tn vn) = abi.decode(encodedBytes, (T1, T2, ..., Tn));`

decodes the encoded bytes into the respective types stored in independent expressions `v1`, `v2`, ..., `vn`. Trivially, `v1 == e1`, `v2 == e2`, ..., `vn == en` must hold, otherwise there is a bug in the coding process.

We can encode these checks in the fuzzing harness like so (example)

```
contract C {
  uint8[] x;

  function test() public returns (uint) {
     x.length = 3;
     x[0] = 42;
     x[1] = 21;
     x[2] = 33;
     bytes encodedValue = abi.encode(x);
     uint8[] memory y = abi.decode(encodedValue, uint8[]);
     if (y.length != 3) return 1;
     if (y[0] != 42) return 2;    
     if (y[1] != 21) return 3;
     if (y[2] != 33) return 4;
     // Expected return value if no bug
     return 0;    
  }
```    

## Motivation

We can extend the current abi coder fuzzing template with an additional internal function (to avoid abi coding) that accepts a tuple of types as input, invokes abi encode/decode functions and performs checks and returns a value.

## Specification

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
