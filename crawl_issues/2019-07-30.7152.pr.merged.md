# [\#7152 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7152) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Erase pointer knowledge properly inside loops

This came up when analyzing https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7023.
Pointers/references assigned inside loops were not triggering other references of same type and data location to have knowledge about them erased too. This led to false negatives.
