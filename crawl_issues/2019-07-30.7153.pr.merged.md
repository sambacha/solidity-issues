# [\#7153 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7153) `merged`: import ast from JSON

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9882716?v=4" width="50">[djudjuu](https://github.com/djudjuu) opened issue at [2019-07-30 11:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7153):

This introduces a new input format to the compiler: an AST in JSON format, as produced by ```--standard-json`` or ```` --combined-json ast,compact-format```. Importing an AST leaves the compiler in the same state as after *CompilerStack::parse()*.

Motiviation: This could enable things like mutation testing.

### Current status:

- [x] ```--import-ast``` option in commandline able to import and compile all kinds of AST-nodes
- this assumes that inline assembly is exported to an AST as well, so #7537 will have to be merged first.

- [x] testuite that verifies  
  - [x] that an imported and exported AST is the same as original import
  
The testsuite runs on all contracts defined in ```/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/```. As some syntaxTestfiles define multiple sources in one file, a script is added that separates those to their own files (creating directories in the process) and removing those after it is done.

### Other changes introduces by this PR
- in the metadata the compiler now
    - defines new input-language *solidityAST*,  and
    - [sources][sourceName][content] is the compactPrint of the Json used as source (needs testing)
- Also, the PseudoAstNodes, such as created when parsing magic variable expressions such as ```this, block.x, msg.x``` now all have the special nodeID < 0
- - When resetting the IDDispenser, there now is the option to register dispensed Id's (and throw errors if an an AST uses the same Id more than once. 
- ASTJson-export now creates full Identifier-ASTNodes for the original contractIdentifier in  importStatements such as ``` import {C as BC} from ...```. Previously C was only referred to with its ID and the information about the name C was lost, which made it impossible to reconstruct the IdentifierNode.
- IDDispenser can now keep track of dispensed IDs if asked to do so during reset.

## left TODOs

This PR assumes that InlineAssembly is exported to an ast (currently being reviewed in 
 #7537). 
So to make it work and develop the tests I added the changes from there in a second commit. 

- [x] So before this would be entirely merged, one should remove the second commit in this PR. 
- [x] add ```scripts/AstImportTest.sh``` to the testsuite. I tried adding it to ```cmdlineTests.sh``` which worked for me locally, but it broke some tests.
- [x] remove (currently commented out) debugging ```echo xxx``` from the two files in scripts
- [x] decide on what to output if an imported and exported ast-json does not match the original. Expected vs Obtained, diff, both?
- [x] make sure that testscript removes all created files, ALSO when the tests fails. (probably best to move everything in a temporary directory...
- [x] check failing pipeline tests (hmm. this one might be a bigger one, but previous to some tiny commits all tests beside the os_x tests were passing, so I am hoping those that turned up just recently are simple in their nature. fingers crossed)

## bug3: address(this) has a wrong "referencedDeclaration" [SOLVED]

### steps to reproduce

- uncomment those [lines](https://github.com/djudjuu/solidity/blob/81b924ab4ffd9d85fb0f60427ee44bf62f3457f7/test/libsolidity/ASTImport/address_payable.sol#L7) and run the test
- expectedResult: the json of ```[functioncall][arguments][identifier][referencedDeclaration]: 66``` (or some other low number
- obtained Result will be 144, (or somehting equally high)

### suspected source

"referencedDeclaration" is produced from this:
```  
IdentifierAnnotation& Identifier::annotation() const
{
	if (!m_annotation)
		m_annotation = new IdentifierAnnotation();
	return dynamic_cast<IdentifierAnnotation&>(*m_annotation);
}
```
so when there is no annotation, it will just produce a new one...

### ideas about fixing it

Another thing i think i understood is that the annotations are set in the analyze()-step by the NameAndTypeResolver, which uses ```m_sourceOrder``` which in turn is filled in ```resolveImports()``` (called first thing in CompilerStack::analyze())

resolveImports relies on ```m_sources,``` which is not filled (instead I created m_sourceJsons), but it also refers to annotation() in its toposort()-function. Is it creating those in that step?

So possible avenues for solving it could be to mdofify m_sourceJsons so that it can be used to fill m_sourceOrder??

===========

## SOLUTION:
magic variables such as this, block.x are producing some Pseudo-ASTNodes, some of those apparently during parsing. So from now on those will all have nodeID 0

## current list of code-lines that trigger bugs: [SOLVED, see above]

#### throw.sol
```
    require(x != 7, "You must NOT ask for seven");
    assert(x != 77); 
    if (x == 777) { revert(); }
```
leads to wrong referenced declarations in nodeType Identifier

#### import.sol
```
import * as base from "./basicContracts.sol";
contract ABCD is base.A, base.B, base.C, base.D {}
```
-> first and last element are switched in AST-Node baseContracts
 (and more)

#### address_payable.sol

```
 configure ASTImporter to use the evm-version specified in the JSON
```

The evm version and the ast should be unrelated. The evm version is a setting for the compiler that can be mixed with any source code and the ast is the representation of the source code only, and not of the compiler switches and settings.

As far as the testing is concerned: Why do you need to store the .json as a file? Wouldn't a usual test just take the solidity source code, export it to json-ast, and compile. Then clear all internal state, re-import from the ast and check that the result is (almost) the same?

Yeah, that would be a better way. The testfile grew as I adapted the ASTJSONTest and I stopped refactoring it once it did the job. I'll put that on the todo-list.

latest problem: 

When exporting inline-assembly we are losing informatin about the sourceLocation. In the code it is like this:

```
contract C {
    uint constant x = 2**20;
    bool constant b = true;
    bytes4 constant s = "ab";
    function f() public pure {
        assembly {
            let c1 := x
            let c2 := b
            let c3 := s
        }
    }
}
```

in the imported & analyzed json:

```
 {

                      [

                    }
                  ]
                },
```


I looked at the AST-Nodes for the respective declarations to see if their src-locations could inform what should be there, but I could not see how they are connected :/

e.g. the ast-node for "x": How would 17:23:0 relate to 172:1:0 ?
```
              {
                "constant": true,
                "id": 5,
                "name": "x",
                "nodeType": "VariableDeclaration",
                "scope": 17,
                "src": "17:23:0",
                "stateVariable": true,
                "storageLocation": "default",
                "typeDescriptions":
                {
                  "typeIdentifier": "t_uint256",
                  "typeString": "uint256"
                },
                "typeName":
                {...},
                "value":
                {...},
                "visibility": "internal"
                }

> I think the offset you need to add to the yul source locations is the end location of the inline assembly node minus the length of the "operations" string :-D.

I think there are some amounts of whitespaces missing in the operations string too:

My reasoning:  Each yul src-locations requires a differnt offset it seems. The first desired offset is 156, each subsequent line then requires an offset higher by 8 more (156,164,172) , which is the original indent of the assemblyblock. 
So maybe we need to adjust the parsing of the operations block to not cut those out.

Sidenote: Also the needed offset for the first variable is 156, whereas the inlineAssembly length - lenOfOpString is 183. So that difference is 27, which does not make sense  in terms of  whitespaces(=12) or lenOf("assembly")=8.

EDIT: the reason for the whitespace mismatch is the use of ``yul::AsmPrinter`` for the "operations" string, which uses pretty printing.

I only see two clean solutions for the inline assembly issue - either outputting the exact original inline assembly source instead of a pretty-printed version or going ahead with full yul-AST export and import a la https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2419

EDIT: note that this is not only about getting the locations for the "externalReferences" in the inline assembly AST node to match, but also about the locations in all other yul AST nodes - it might not be disastrous for them to have mismatching source locations, but that could be a source for very subtle differences between parsing and importing, so I think it's worthwhile to make sure that all of them match.

For The first option , I think that the recreating original inline assembly
sourcelayout will require to calculate the amount of extra whitespaces
ahead of each line, which is information that only exists very implicitly
in the src-locations...

@Marenz @chriseth 

I think this PR is now in a good state to be reviewed. I made some notes on what still needs to be done. I will answer to comments and am happy to explain why I build certain things the way they are, but I am unsure how much time I will be able to devote to implement change requests.

This code is currently crashing the solfuzzer:

```
		contract C {
			function f() public {
				assembly {
					let a1, b1, c1
					function asmfun(a, b, c) -> x, y, z {
						x := a
						y := b
						z := 7
					}
					a1, b1, c1 := asmfun(1, 2, 3)
					mstore(0x00, a1)
					mstore(0x20, b1)
					mstore(0x40, c1)
					return(0, 0x60)
				}
			}
		}
```

I tracked it down to https://github.com/djudjuu/solidity/blob/newImportAST/libsolidity/ast/AsmJsonConverter.cpp#L151
where `_node.value` is a `std::unique_ptr<boost::variant<yul::FunctionalInstruction, yul::FunctionCall, yul::Identifier, yul::Literal>> = {get() = 0x0}` that points to null.

@djudjuu does this point to a problem earlier in the code? Or should this be nullptr checked and if null, not called?

so.. if I understand it right this happens whenever there is a non-initialized asm variable because then `value` is null.. so I guess checking for nullptr is the right approach here.

Most of those assertions for `non-null` are useless when the values are then casted to a specific type (such as Int64 or String). It would be better asserting for specific types instead.

I just noticed a complication @chriseth Exporting the version means the tests have a hard-coded version in the json files, which makes testing different evm versions difficult

I could use something like `%EVMVERSION%` in the testfiles and search&replace that before testing
