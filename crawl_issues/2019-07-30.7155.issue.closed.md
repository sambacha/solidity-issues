# [\#7155 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7155) `closed`: Uncalled address.send or address.transfer causes internal compiler error
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35589221?v=4" width="50">[haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at) opened issue at [2019-07-30 23:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7155):

## Description

If `<address>.send` or `<address>.transfer` is used as a bare expression (i.e. not then called), the compiler fails with an internal compiler error.  Specifically:

```
InternalCompilerError: I sense a disturbance in the stack: 2 vs 1
```

While there's admittedly no good reason to ever do this, it shouldn't cause an internal error.  At the worst it should cause a more explicit error message.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.10
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): whatever the default is
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Linux Mint 19.1

## Steps to Reproduce

Attempt to compile the following contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract TransferTest {
  function() external payable {
    address(this).transfer;
  }
}
```
