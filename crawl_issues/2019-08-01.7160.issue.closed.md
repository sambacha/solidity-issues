# [\#7160 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7160) `closed`: [Abiv2 fuzzer] Permit zero sized dynamically sized arrays

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-08-01 14:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7160):

## Abstract

In the abiv2 proto fuzzer, the existing lower bound for the size of dynamically arrays is 1. It should be 0 instead. Statically sized arrays continue to keep a lower bound of 1.

## Motivation

Tweak the utility function responsible for determining array sizes.
