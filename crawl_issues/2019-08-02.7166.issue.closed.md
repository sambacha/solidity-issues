# [\#7166 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7166) `closed`: [Abiv2 proto fuzzer] Add constructor to test template
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

## Abstract

Presently, the ABIv2 test template does not contain a constructor. This issue tracks support for adding one with the following structure:

```
constructor() {
  // Initialize state variables
}
```

This does not yet test ABI coding with the constructor because the abi proto fuzzer does not yet support ABI encoding itself.


## Motivation

Adding the constructor should be straight forward. We would need to move initializations of state variables to the `constructor` function instead of the `test` function.

What would be the benefit?

@chriseth After thinking about this for a little longer, I don't see any benefit unless the constructor accepts external arguments. If it does, we can test abi coding in the constructor. Actually, my motivation for this was #6754

We should indeed fuzz constructor argument decoding, including passing on arguments to base constructors.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
