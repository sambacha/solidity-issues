## Abstract

Currently, the abiv2 proto fuzzer tests abi coding internally i.e., values passed to coding functions are obtained from within the contract storage/memory.

This issue tracks support for testing ABI coding inside a contract's constructor for which data must be obtained from an external source.

## Motivation

We need to
   - figure out a way to ABI encode the input to a contract's constructor
   - figure out what input signature the constructor expects

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
