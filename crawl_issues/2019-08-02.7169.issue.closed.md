Hello @christina938 and welcome aboard!

So, first steps, create a fork of the repo that you will work in and let me know what it is, later I'll need the version added to Read the Docs, but that can come much later.

Our documentation uses Sphinx and RsT (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) which isn't the easiest syntax wise, but you can ignore a lot of it anyway and focus on the text.

I'd recommend you start with the introductory content and the getting started guides, and we can leave the other documentation in it's English versions as you translate each file, just so there's something for people to read in Bulgarian, instead of leaving it until you're completely finished.

Any questions you have, please let me know!
