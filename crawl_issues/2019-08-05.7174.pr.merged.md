Fixes doxygen style multiline comment parsing for files with CRLF as line terminators.

Fixes #7150
Related: #4885

### Summary
So this PR is now treating CR, LF, and CRLF as newlines in Scanner.cpp. I added one test wrt multiline comments, and extended some others that only cared about CR and LF as line terminators.

### Old Behavior
Only CR and LF alone was treated as newline, hence, a CRLF have been two newlines.

### New Behavior
Along with CR and LF, also CRLF is treated as newline.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
- [x] ~~README / documentation was extended, if necessary~~
- [x] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)

Please add changelog.

All places where `isLineTerminator` is called concern multi-line comments. This PR only changes one of these places. We should either change all of them or state that we only support `\n`-terminated files.

I'll look for the remaining places, too. I've been a little hasty it seems.

Maybe we should even try to fix all of those places **and still** state that we only support ``\n``-terminated files and CRLF might or might not work? Otherwise we should probably start specifically testing this...

I have added *some* wrt doxygen style LF/CRLF handling, but also adapted *all* other occurrences of `isLineTerminator(m_char)` to properly detect LF/CRLF. I think I covered all places of LF handlings with this. If you find more @ekpyron, I'll adjust those, too.

Besides the Changelog suggestion, this looks good. Please also rebase.
