# [\#7178 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7178) `merged`: Split calldataEncodedSize.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-08-05 16:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7178):

This is just a first go at making things work with such a split - every instance of ``calldataEncodedSize`` has yet to be rechecked to verify which value is actually needed.

EDIT: this is based on #7072 and I'll push this on top of #7072, once it's in a reasonable state - this PR is meant to allow early discussion of this update of #7072.

EDIT: since I now squashed this here already, this just closes #7072.

@chriseth It's too early to really review this, but I already pushed a draft, so we're clear on the direction of this - we also might want to discuss whether we can reduce the three functions to two functions in the end after all at some point, when I made sure that this draft has everything right.

Looking at the actual changes in this preliminary PR with the threeway-split, I think it might be enough to keep ``calldataEncodedSize`` for all types, define it to be ``32`` for dynamically encoded types and only implement ``calldataEncodedTailSize`` in ``ReferenceType``.

``calldataEncodedStride`` is not a good name, especially since we also have ``ArrayType::calldataStride``. Not sure what'd be better yet...

I'm going for ``calldataHeadIncrement`` now.
We could still choose ``calldataHeadSize`` over it and I'm generally still open to suggestions...

There's three TODO items left, but I think this is worth a look/review now.

Most of the remaining ``calldataEncodedSize`` not touched by this PR are guarded by asserting statically-sized- or even value-types. I think all are fine, but it'd be good if someone else rechecked.

@sifmelcara Thank you very much for the comments, they are very helpful! I'll adjust the PR later today and let you know.

Updated - I'll squash if everything's fine now.
