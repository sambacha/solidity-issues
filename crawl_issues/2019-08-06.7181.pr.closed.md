I'm still not sure this is the right place. Shouldn't it rather go into `output`?

When you say `output`, you mean the same level where `metadata` is? Under the name of the contract?

The same level as ``abi``, right? So around here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/a11f6c98079525afa591e51c018f1bd23646217b/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp#L1162 ? Should we also have a ``contractName`` field in there as suggested in the issue?

I don't see `"output"` anywhere in the doc example at https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#output-description
And the example in the doc already has the contract name as key name of the object..

@Marenz 
```
        // See the Metadata Output documentation (serialised JSON string)
        "metadata": "{...}",
```
See https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata.html ;-).

Okay, moved to `"output"` now

We do not need 'contractName' because that is already accomplished by the 'compilationTarget' field.

I still feel this needs more discussion before merging. Which other information do we want to add in the future? Should we group them?

I was trying to think of other information we'd want to add and couldn't come up with anything so far..

@seanyoung maybe you have some ideas?

If we're going to implement https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1650, do we want to add those globals to the metadata as well?

I've given this some thought. There is one thing I would like to see: I think it would be useful to know what contracts the contract can create, see #7111  This is useful in burrow for managing metadata (including abis) for contracts.

I also have the feeling that we could try to group / reorder them as @chriseth already suggested. I would propose a few changes:

- Move the `optimizer` settings to `compiler`
- Add new top-level field `input` and move `sources`, `libraries` and `metadata` there, this could be a place to also add the globals mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1650

Shall I move it to metadata then?

@Marenz To reciprocate to your PR nagging: what's the state of this ;-)? Maybe we should bring this one up in the next call and decide its fate.

I'm closing this and will update the issue with an explanation.
