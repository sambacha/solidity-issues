Updated PR. I assumed that if the type of last parameter is one of the following, then at least 32 bytes need to be cropped from a valid abi encoding to create an invalid encoding
  - bytes/string
  - arrays whose base type is bytes/string

Do you want to take my suggestions regarding the tiny refactoring of `variableLengthValueAsString` into account? I think it's also ready to be merged without.

Sorry for the delay on this. Actually, I was waiting for @ekpyron feedback on the implementation of the padding check. Will take a second look at @erak refactoring comment soon. Context switching is making me take longer to come up with an elegant refactoring :-)

Just had a quick look at the padding check and that looks good to me in any case - let me know, if you'll refactor this some more or not, then I'll have another more detailed look.

@erak Updated PR to mainly address your refactoring comment.
