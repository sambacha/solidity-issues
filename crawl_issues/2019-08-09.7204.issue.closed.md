# [\#7204 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7204) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Test all combinations of solvers

This requires an internal CompilerStack setting that says which SMT solvers to use.
This would allow different test case expectations:
- when using nonlinear arithmetics since CVC4 seems to be able to handle it better than Z3
- when finding invariants since CHC requires Z3

We have implemented the solver switch which is used by some test cases that require a specific solver.
