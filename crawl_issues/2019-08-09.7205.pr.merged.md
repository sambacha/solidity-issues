Defaults building Solidity with C++17 (instead of C++14).

### Prerequisite:
* Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6884 (static Z3 PR)

### Changes Included:
* Bump cmake version requirement from 3.5 to 3.10.
* Bump default toolchain to compile in C++17 mode
* Add cxx20 toolchain to compile in C++20 mode (for CI testing)
* `install_cmake.sh` updated installed cmake from 3.7.1 to 3.15.2 (latest stable release)

### Note:
This PR still contains the `b_ubu_cxx17` task, which should be removed **before** merging, as it's not needed anymore.
