# [\#7228 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7228) `merged`: [Trivial] Test scripts: Make build dir a variable

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424752?u=2d50de05ec528b9b84f8b905a56e90669b0f8927&v=4" width="50">[Marenz](https://github.com/Marenz) opened issue at [2019-08-13 10:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7228):

This makes it easier to just use a dedicated docker build dir.
