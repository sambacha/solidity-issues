# [\#7231 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7231) `merged`: [Yul] Remove ContainsMSize from side-effect-collector.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-08-13 11:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7231):

This is a refactoring connected to #7137. The 'containsMSize' property is moved into its own class because it is the only "side-effects"-property that is a global property of the program instead of a local property of an instruction or function.
