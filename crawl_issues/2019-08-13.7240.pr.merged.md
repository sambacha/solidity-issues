# [\#7240 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7240) `merged`: .clang-format for the C++ style used in Solidity

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8851?v=4" width="50">[rocky](https://github.com/rocky) opened issue at [2019-08-13 15:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7240):

### Description

Start a [clang-format](https://electronjs.org/docs/development/clang-format) to ease following the C++ coding style that Solidity conforms to.

Implements #2856.

Do you think this is helpful even if it can never 100% map our coding style?

A couple of thoughts:

1. if your style is different then everyone else's "standard" style, and there _are_ so many to choose from, then maybe you should consider changing your style to match one of the other 10. 

2. Any tool that gets you closer is a win. Otherwise there are just going to be mistakes made. I don't know about you, but in my projects I don't want to spend time thinking about stuff like this, or pointing people at docs or spend time correcting folks on coding style.

We already had that discussion a couple of times. I disagree that any tool that gets you closer is a win, because you start arguing with the tool. Code readability is the main concern. Code is read many more times than it is written, so it makes sense to spend some more time to manually tune the looks of the code and a tool cannot do that.

Ok. Can't you do this while keeping within the guidelines of one of the _existing_  "standard" styles that have been used far longer than Solidity has been in existence?

I really like one particular feature which all tools fail to support and this is properly terminating lists of arguments by unindenting again.

Sure, I understand your point about tools being insufficient for the esthetic that would be nice to have in programs. Here is another thing like that, that I used to do a lot: align the right-hand sides of assignment statements. Like

```C
a    = 1;
ab   = 2;
abc  = 3;
abcd = 4;
```

However after many years of bucking the trend and standards, I found that I just had to give up on that. Those who work on several C++ projects and several other open-source projects in general, just have to be a little more flexible. There are other projects that are just as rigid about doing the indentation the other way and will insist loudly that this is indeed the _proper_ indentation. 

That said, what would help is in the coding style guide emphasizing the _differences_ between the Solidity style and the closest existing style. That way others, like me, can start with an existing style like LLVM and then manually adjust for the exceptions.

I really don't want to discuss this further. If you think it is helpful, it is fine for me to have it, as with the differently named build directory.

Where did you get that file from? Are the adjustments from llvm yours?

I think `BinPackParameters: false` and `BinPackArguments: false` is important for us.

Ok. That's in  c420ccc . Anything else?

Wonderful! Now my main question is: How do I use that file in a useful way?

From emacs https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/tools/clang-format/clang-format.el
can be used. 

I am confused about your question though.  I was not assuming you would use it, because you've been fine without it. So I assume you meant how would _others_ use this in a useful way.

When you wrote a while back: 

> I really don't want to discuss this further. If you think it is helpful, it is fine for me to have it, as with the differently named build directory.

Because you didn't want to discuss this further, I thought that all you were asking was whether I thought this would be useful, which I do.

I don't have any way of knowing *how* useful. I got the link above by google'ing "clang-format" and "Emacs". I would not be surprised if you substituted "atom editor", "vim" or "vscode" for "Emacs" you get results outside what is in https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/tree/master/tools/clang-format 

And even if there happens to be nothing else out there, having the Solidity C++ style broken down into its various attributes in a machine-readable format is helpful. Who knows, maybe someone (perhaps even me) will write a tool that uses this in the way that would be "useful" if it isn't already.

Since you bring up the flexible Cmake "build" directories, let me say that I've use that pervasively and have a build directory per branch. For example for this branch, I have a `build-add-clang-format` directory even though building seems hardly necessary here.  So thanks for letting that go through!

I appreciate your tolerance and understanding that others may work in a style and environment different from the one(s) you are familiar with to the point where additional configuration files can be added to Solidity to assist those who use different coding environments.  So again my thanks.

Sure, I did not plan to use it myself, but I just want to have an answer ready if someone asks "hey, what is that file and how do I use it" ;)

"configure your IDE to use it" is a good answer. Another answer would be "oh there is this tool that you run and it formats your source".

Is there a way we can validate how close it is to our style?

1. Go to https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/ 
1. Load in the configuration
1. Paste in an existing Solidity C++ file
1. Look at the displayed output. 
1. For those things that don't look right, adjust settings on the left-hand side to fix
