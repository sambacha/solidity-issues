# [\#7249 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7249) `closed`: [ossfuzz] build instrumentation can do without instrumented dependencies

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-08-14 10:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7249):

## Abstract

Currently, the following solidity (fuzzing) dependencies are instrumented (either by address or undefined behavior sanitizer)
  - boost
  - evmone
  - intx
  - ethash

This has the following negatives
  - slower build
  - slower fuzzing due to additional run time overhead (e.g., asan checks whether each load/store is within bounds) due to instrumented dependencies
  - bugs in dependencies get reported to us instead of their respective maintainers

Since we make use of (fixed) versioned dependencies, their building may instead be moved to the dockerfile where they will be build once and cached (in the resulting docker image).

## Motivation

This will need to be fixed in the `build.sh` script located here (so a PR to google/oss-fuzz repo is required)

## Specification
