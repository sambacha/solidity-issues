# [\#7250 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7250) `closed`: [ossfuzz] build CI needs to more closely emulate Google's CI so we notice build incompatibilities right away

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-08-14 10:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7250):

## Abstract

Currently, there is a divergence between Google's oss-fuzz builder, located here

https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/solidity

and our "builder" which is a composite of our own dockerfile here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/6c31a5f3ddfb40d1f5f70823569d2f0c6792d13c/.circleci/docker/Dockerfile.ubuntu1904

and build script here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/6c31a5f3ddfb40d1f5f70823569d2f0c6792d13c/.circleci/config.yml#L280-L286

This issue tracks support for bringing these two CIs closer in alignment so that build failures can be better anticipated.

## Motivation

<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->
