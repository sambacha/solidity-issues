# [\#7251 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7251) `merged`: Side effects for user defined functions

Extracted from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7137

Still need to take a look at #7137 if CommonSubexpressionEliminator is really the only component that can benefit from the side-effects.

closes #7137

Argh, wanted to make this a draft.

Needs more tests that show that side-effects are actually properly computed, especially with recursive calls etc.

The load resolver should also make use of this.

Actually no, the load resolver should not use this.

RedundantAssignEliminator might make use of it, but if it is run after SSATransform, the right-hand-sides of assignments (with a single variable) are variables anyway, so it is not helpful.

The UnusedPruner should use side-effects of functions instead.

The required tests mentioned above are already merged (3c4f55824)

Re-correcting myself: The load resolver can make heavy use of this, because it should not clear knowledge about storage/memory when functions are called that do not touch memory/storage!

Why not make the constructor of ``CommonSubexpressionEliminator`` private and replace it by a static ``run`` on the AST that itself calls ``SideEffectsPropagator::sideEffects(_dialect, CallGraphGenerator::callGraph(ast))`` and passes the result down to the private constructor and from there down to ``DataFlowAnalyzer`` by value?
