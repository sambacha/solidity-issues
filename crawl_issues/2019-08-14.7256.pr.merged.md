And now it's merged and I don't see a way to re-open it :-).

I think we have to create multiple ones, don't we? Another option is to merge the branch manually without the github interface.

Something like that... maybe a draft PR that stays open and a separate short-lived PR whenever we actually want to merge?

Github will auto-close the PR when the branch is merged: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7265

Yeah, well, then we probably have to open another once we merge one of these.

Ah, we can't do that either, because github doesn't let you create a PR, if there's nothing new to merge :-). Well, I don't know then :-).
