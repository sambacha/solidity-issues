## Abstract

Currently, the ossfuzz builder links fuzzing binaries against `libstdc++` instead of the clang provided standard library implementation called `libc++`

This issue tracks support for standardizing this.

## Motivation

To get this going, we need to build boost dependencies statically or against libc++.

## Specification

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

TBD
