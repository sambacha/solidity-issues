# [\#7262 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7262) `merged`: Build cvc4 when packaging the snap

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/617831?u=b36c07f0703da3bdbef7b3a4ba7fea66ee600875&v=4" width="50">[come-maiz](https://github.com/come-maiz) opened issue at [2019-08-15 00:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7262):

### Description

Since the migration to c++17, the build of the snap started to fail because of cvc4:
https://launchpadlibrarian.net/437242532/buildlog_snap_ubuntu_bionic_i386_solc-candidate_BUILDING.txt.gz

There is a new upstream version of cvc4 that is not yet in the ubuntu archives, so it's good to take that one. Also I have been wanting to do this for a long time to see if it fixes the builds in arm, but I haven't tested that.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

@ekpyron There ar ways to use the Disco packages. There is a `base` keyword that tells the builders which distro to use, but I think it's just for long term supported versions. Another way is to just get a disco machine and build there, but the launchpad builders don't offer that version. This makes me think that it's safer to stay in bionic for now.
