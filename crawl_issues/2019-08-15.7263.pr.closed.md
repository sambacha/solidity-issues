Thanks for the pull request! Can you split it up into multiple pull requests, one concept at a time?
Also, are we sure that `std::filesystem` and `boost::filesystem` are identical?
Furthermore, you probably also want to replace `boost::apply_visitor`.

Please create one pull request where you only replace the boost::variant with its std version. This also needs a change to every call of boost::apply_visitor, because it is a utility method that comes together with boost::variant.

@Patil2099 Yes, I would be good, if you could make one PR for `boost::optional`, one for `boost::filesystem` and one for `boost::apply_visitor`. This way we keep the PRs relatively small and manageable. Thank you.
