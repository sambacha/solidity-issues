There are a lot of `shared_ptr` being used for `smt::Sort` where they could be raw pointers.

@ekpyron actually why did we want them to be raw pointers instead of shared_ptr?

shared pointer have non-zero overhead and you always need to be careful about them becoming cyclically dependent on each other...
In general, it's always nicer to have clearly defined explicit ownership and lifetimes instead - but not sure if there was any more concrete reason than that...

Yea, tho I'm wondering if that really makes sense for the SMT sorts

Rather similar case to us introducing that ``TypeProvider`` thing for the solidity AST I guess.

Hello, @leonardoalt this problem is still relevant?

Why not use unique_ptrs as opposed to raw pointers ? Also, I would like to contribute to this issue if possible

Iâ€™m interested in working on this issue of refactoring shared_ptr to raw pointers or unique_ptr. Could you provide some guidance on the preferred approach?
