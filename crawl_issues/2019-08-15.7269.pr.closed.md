# [\#7269 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7269) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Do not report error to the user in case of solver timeout

In case of solver timeout, Z3 throws an exception that says "canceled". As pointed in https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/2425, "canceled covers timeout, resource limit and user-interrupts.".

Currently, if only Z3 is used and it times out the SMTChecker issues a warning to the user `Error trying to invoke SMT solver`. To me we should treat such cases as `unknown`. That's what this PR does.

CVC4 already returns `unknown` for a query if it times out. I asked https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4/issues/3194 to confirm my tests.

Hm... I dug a little deeper into the Z3 docs... the "proper" way to solve this would in fact be to use ``set_enable_exceptions(false)`` before the check and ``set_enable_exceptions(true)`` after the check - then the check will return ``unknown`` in error cases and you should be able to check whether ``solver.reason_unknown()`` returns "timeout"... I think that'd be the more robust solution in the end...

Yep, that sounds good!

I don't know why but it actually varies whether it says `timeout` or `canceled`.

Actually I'm not sure about your suggestion @ekpyron. If the check doesn't throw on timeout but returns unknown, I know whether it actually timed out when the answer is unknown. But what if there was an actual error?

Something like that maybe?
```
case z3::check_result::unknown:
  if (m_solver.check_error() != Z3_OK && m_solver.reason_unknown() != "timeout")
     // throw
  else
     // some "okish unknown = unsolvable/undecidable (?)" or a timeout
```
I'm not sure - you'll have to try... if nothing really works we can still go with the original solution...

I mainly looked at the header doc and at what it actually does down to the C API here https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/classz3_1_1solver.html#a65d4e25fe55aa280fa800b9611cd8c04 and here https://z3prover.github.io/api/html/classz3_1_1solver.html#aea74ca5ea02112626ff07f26ddc6f3bc
So it's more of a guess ;-).

That probably works, but doesn't that look more hacky than the original PR?

Hm... catching exceptions in not-so-exceptional-cases is not so nice... and searching for a substring to determine the exception kind neither... but yeah - it's not **that** much better as well, that's for sure...

As you like - I'd reapprove the original PR as well, if it works and you prefer :-).

You're right, I'll implement the latest suggestion.

In that case `m_solver.check_error()` returns `Z3_EXCEPTION` and `m_solver.reason_unknown()` returns `"ok"`. I'm still not convinced by any solution, closing this PR for now.
