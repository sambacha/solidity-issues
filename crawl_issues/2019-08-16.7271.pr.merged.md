# [\#7271 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7271) `merged`: Support multiple sources for syntax tests.

Implementation for syntax tests only, since the execution framework would need changes for supporting multiple sources in semantics tests.

The only import tests that can't yet be extracted are the remapping tests.
Remappings could be a syntax test setting, then they could be extracted as well... not sure if I add that to this PR as well, though...

Note that this *can't* deal with source names containing a ``:`` or starting with a digit - but to me it seems that these limitations are fine...
EDIT: See the parsing of source locations to ``SyntaxTestError``  with source names in ``SyntaxTest::parseExpectations``. If we decide that it'd be nice to support such source names, we could e.g. just require quotes around the source name, e.g. ``Warning ("42weird:source:name":1-4): ...``

Will fix!
