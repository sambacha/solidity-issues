@Patil2099 Unfortunately, your branch does not compile. Did you check on your machine? Also please squash your commits and add a meaningful message, such as `Replaces boost::variant with std::variant`. Are you in the Solidity development channel on Gitter: https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev ? I could add you there and provide further guidance.

I suspect the `#include`'s need to be changed, too?

Closing for now because there's a no progress on it and it also does not have a high priority. Please reopen in case you want to continue working on it.
