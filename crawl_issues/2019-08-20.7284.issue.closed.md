# [\#7284 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7284) `closed`: [yul] function defined in for loop body not visible in outer scope?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-08-20 09:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7284):

## Description

```
{
for { let i_0 := 0 } lt(i_0, 0x60) { i_0 := add(i_0, 0x20) } {
function foo_noreturn_0() {}
}
foo_noreturn_0()
}
```

`solc` tells me this is not valid yul code, but should it be that way?

```
$ solc --strict-assembly <code.yul>
code.yul:5:1: Error: Function not found.
foo_noreturn_0()
^------------^
```

From the docs

> Scopes in Yul are tied to Blocks (exceptions are functions and the for loop as explained below) and all declarations (FunctionDefinition, VariableDeclaration) introduce new identifiers into these scopes.

I suppose that means that a function is visible in the scope it was defined in.
