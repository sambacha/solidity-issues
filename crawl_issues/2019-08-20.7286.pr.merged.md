Did this some time ago. They were semi-automatically generated I think. Essentially, @ekpyron suggested some things after considering https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e96003e709e3b12657cb2ca34c49f0f86577e299/libevmasm/RuleList.h

I think I wrote a python script to generate powers of two plus/minus 1.
