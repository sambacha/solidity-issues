## Description

```
{
function foo() {
        let x
        function bar() { foo() x := 1 }
}
}
```

`foo()` is valid inside `bar()` but `x` is not. Is this on purpose?

I guess this is because `foo()`'s scope is tied to its outer scope (globally, in this case) and since `bar()` is in this outer scope, `foo()` is visible inside `bar()`'s body. However, the scope of `x` is tied to `foo()`'s scope which does not cross function boundary.

Indeed, scopes of variables do not cross function boundaries, but functions do (they have to, otherwise you cannot usefully call any function). Do you think this is a problem?

Yeah, I realized I filed an issue too soon :-)

It's not a problem, only requires a refactoring of the yul proto fuzzer in preparation for #7276
