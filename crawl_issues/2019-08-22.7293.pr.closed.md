Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7296

### Description

When `--error-recovery` is in effect we might not produce an nonnull
ast, even though we can recover from an error.

Example:

```
pragma 0.5.11;
c
```

I don't think this is the proper fix. You changed the code to make the compiler continue with the error so that it runs into a much more severe error. It may be better for the host system than a segmentation fault, but I think it is more dangerous to accidentally generate bytecode that does not correspond to the source code at all than causing a segmentation fault in the compiling system.

Since you do not have the time to fix it properly I propose to close this pull request and keep the issue open.
