# [\#7298 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7298) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Adapt division test for Z3 only

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2019-08-23 15:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7298):

Fixes #7297 

Z3 4.8.5 times out in the overflow query which makes the test fail when not using CVC4 (which is able to solve it).
The test is adapted to allow for success (now that division by 0 does not happen anymore) or unknown solver result.
