Hello!

First of all, thanks for your (hard) work!

### Description

As an OpenSource project, I believe Web3.js should have a `FUNDING.yml` file which lets people make donations if they enjoy the software.

This pull requests adds donation thru an [Unlock](https://unlock-protocol.com/) lock. Locks are smart contract which let people become members by purchasing a key. The key itself is a non fungible token: üóù . (you can view the NFT on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/0x38Ad3BEA0FA53A7Ac63Ba56CAA88ce1DE690E1Ea/1) for example)

This specific lock is at [`0x38Ad3BEA0FA53A7Ac63Ba56CAA88ce1DE690E1Ea`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x38Ad3BEA0FA53A7Ac63Ba56CAA88ce1DE690E1Ea). The current key price is 1 Ether. I currently own the lock but I'll happily transfer its ownership to you if you can send me an address ;) Keys are valid for 1 month and there can be an infinite number of keys.

The pull-request adds 2 files: `FUNDING.yml` which is a github standard file to add a "donation button" with the right links when people click on it and a file which includes the configuration for the donation page.

Here is what it looks like :

You can try this on another project which already uses the donation button such as [Unlock](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock/), [MyCrypto](https://github.com/mycryptohq/mycrypto), or [WalletConnect](https://github.com/WalletConnect/walletconnect-monorepo/)...

When/if you merge this you also need to enable donations in the settings (see https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/settings):

Thank you very much for your efforts, but we think that at the current time, this will not significantly help the Solidity project.
