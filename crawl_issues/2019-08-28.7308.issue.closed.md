# [\#7308 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7308) `closed`: [yul] proto fuzzer: Do not shadow variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-08-28 08:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7308):

## Abstract

Currently, the proto fuzzer can generate code like this

```
{
  {
    let x_0
  }
  let x_0
}
```

which does not break any programming rules but is not elegant. This issue tracks support for removing shadowing from variable names generated by the proto fuzzer, so we turn the code above into something like

```
{
  {
    let x_0
  }
  let x_1
}
```
