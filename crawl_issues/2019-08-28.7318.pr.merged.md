I think this PR is rather important to get in quickly, but I currently do not have the resources to look at it in depth. I'm fine to merge this if it generates valid and meaningful code.

@chriseth I have been fuzzing this PR over the last couple of days locally and didn't find anything unexpected. For reference, here are some programs generated by it.

I am currently investigating why test coverage slightly drops with this PR but I feel in the long run, this might not be a problem. Will update shortly with a more conclusive opinion.

Ok, great!

Do you know why most of the programs are rather "uniform" - example: https://gist.github.com/bshastry/dde67b9239cef4ab71f953184a731705#file-100_yul_programs_generated_by_pr7318-L2196
