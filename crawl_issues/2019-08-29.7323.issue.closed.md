Replace `mstore8(x, and(y, a)` with `mstore8(x, y)` where `a >= 0xff`.

Note, this would be made obsolete with range tracking where all unneeded masking could be removed.

Note that `bytes memory x; ... x[2] = 3;` is the only place where the code generator uses `mstore8`.

Furthermore, I think the condition is `a & 0xff == 0xff` instead of `a >= 0xff`.

I wrote some hand written code and found this case there.

Yep, correct.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
