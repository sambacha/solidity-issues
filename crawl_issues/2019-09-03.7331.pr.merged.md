@guilhermejcgois Thank you very much for the contribution!
@chriseth Can you force-merge this? The emscripten build failure is due to this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7332 and obviously unrelated to this change. EDIT: the boost URL seems to be working again - I just retriggered the test run, it should be fine now.
