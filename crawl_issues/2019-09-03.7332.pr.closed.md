# [\#7332 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7332) `closed`: Change URL for fetching boost sources.

I noticed the emscripten build failing in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7331 - that's due to the old URL https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.70.0/boost_1_70_0.tar.gz currently pointing to an error page - that might only be temporary, but I'd still suggest to switch to the URL linked on https://boost.org.
Note that the hash is unchanged, so it's in fact the same source archive as it used to be.

Yeah, ok - this indeed *was* temporary and now the old URL is working again. We could still merge this or just close it...
