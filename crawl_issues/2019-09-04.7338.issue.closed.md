E.g. we currently have ``and(byte(x,y), 0xff) => byte(x,y)``, but we should also have
``and(0xff, byte(x,y)) => byte(x,y)``.
We could also have ``and(byte(x,y), C) => and(byte(x,y), and(C,0xFF))`` for constants ``C >= 256`` plus its symmetric counterpart.

Following @axic's chat suggestion we could also consider "``BYTE``-introduction-rules" like e.g.:

``and(shr(a*8,x),0xff) => byte(31-a,x)`` (need to recheck byte order, etc.!)

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
