# [\#7340 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7340) `merged`: Array slice syntax (with implementation for dynamic calldata arrays)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-09-04 10:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7340):

So far ~~``x.slice``~~ ``x[start:end]`` is an error for everything but dynamic calldata arrays and slices of them.
For calldata slices ~~only~~ implicit conversions back to calldata arrays are implemented, which means that they can be passed to ``abi.decode`` and nothing besides that (no other conversions, ~~no index access~~, no members). Index accesses for calldata slices are implemented as well.

So rather incomplete, but already Fixes #6012.

There was an error when running `chk_coding_style` for commit `9b7e84711390a395bd85f9e262b4939b993c0a23`:
```
Coding style error:
 libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp:2375: else if(!(arrayType = dynamic_cast<ArrayType const*>(exprType)))

```
Please check that your changes are working as intended.

I did implement the ``[start:end]`` syntax after all now - that requires a bit of fiddling with the index access structure parser, but apart from that it's actually nicer to make it its own AST node and visit it separately in the type checker and during code gen.

We might actually be able to merge this to develop now, though - or is it still breaking in some way?

Nice!

It is breaking in the sense that it introduces a new AST node type. If you have a tool that iterates over the full AST, you might miss some branches because you do not know how the children are called. Let's merge it into 0.6.0 - what would be the harm?

@leonardoalt To be clear: I was just confused before, the range is actually ``[start,end)`` already.

Fine apart from style and the fact that I think the first argument should also be optional.

Looks good! Please rebase and merge.

Rebased. I'll merge once the tests pass (except the two failing expectedly :-)).
