For that matter, they also wrap memory around to zero instead of extending beyond 2^256...

Hm... I think the yellowpaper might actually not be entirely precise for this case...

It looks a little weird to me, but wrapping could also be compatible with the optimizer, since it checks for `abs(a-b) < 32`.

Ah, the yellowpaper is hard to read there, but it is in fact precise - if I understand it correctly, then MSIZE would actually return 32 after such a write and the memory offsets would warp around to zero. However, the gas cost is still based on their mu_i, which is a word count and therefore can't wrap (for a moment I thought the gas calculation was wrong in the yellowpaper in this case, but it was me who was wrong there). We should probably do the same and internally keep the current word count instead of msize directly, but return ``(32*bigint(word_count)) & (bigint(1) << 256 - 1)`` as MSIZE? And of course use offsets modulo 2^256 for the memory writes and reads?

I don't think we need to be that precise with msize, but I can change the store-behaviour to wrapping.

Updated to add wrapping.

I mainly don't think that `msize` should return 32 if we `mstore` to `u256(-31)`.
