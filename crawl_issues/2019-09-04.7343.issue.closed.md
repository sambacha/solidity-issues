# [\#7343 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7343) `closed`: [yul] proto fuzzer: Add untested blockchain operations
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-09-04 11:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7343):

## Abstract

Add the following opcodes
  - address
  - balance
  - origin
  - caller
  - callvalue
  - gasprice
  - blockhash
  - coinbase
  - timestamp
  - number
  - difficulty
  - gaslimit
  - pop

Although their "interpretation" is trivial (because we return constants for most of them), adding them may test the yul optimizer further.

## Motivation

Extend existing nullary and unary operations with the missing ones listed above.
