Please test that:
 - a contract with unimplemented functions (either directly in that contract or inherited) produces an error: "should be marked abstract" or something like that

@chriseth Hmm.. I just started to fix the tests related to `cmdlineTests.sh`.. the current implementation of the `TypeChecker` creates an error if unimplemented functions where detected in a contract not marked as abstract.. if we use errors, we will need to change the related contracts used by `cmdlineTests.sh`, e.g.
```
Compiling various other contracts and libraries...
 - MultiSigWallet/
 - corion/
 - gnosis/
Unexpected compilation result:
Expected failure: 0 - Expected warning / error output: 1
Was failure: 1

Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
Note: The shadowed declaration is here:

Error: Contract "Token" should be marked as abstract.

Error: Contract "Oracle" should be marked as abstract.

Error: Contract "Event" should be marked as abstract.

Error: Contract "Market" should be marked as abstract.

Error: Contract "MarketMaker" should be marked as abstract.

Error: Contract "MarketFactory" should be marked as abstract.
```
Should the `TypeChecker` create an error or a warning related to "should be marked as abstract"?

Probably it's better that the `TypeChecker` is only creating a warning for "should be marked as abstract". With this there is no need to actually change any contracts - but I'm not sure whether its better to be more strict here.

@chriseth I just saw that you referenced https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3594 .. I was now thinking whether it would be helpful to add the not implemented functions to the "should be marked as abstract" error. Something like "Contract "B" should be marked as abstract, because function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool), function bla() and function blaaaa() where not implemented". What do you think?

probably it's nicer to just write the function name and not the full signatures..

@chriseth any news on this? for me the question is whether we want to output what functions where not be implemented, i think it may make much sense to add these information to the "should be marked as abstract" error. what do you think?
