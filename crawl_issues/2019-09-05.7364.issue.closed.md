The compiler should auto-replace user-supplied revert strings by (short) identifiers and store the mapping in some metadata.

So this would happen whenever the revert message is a string literal? And could thereby be prevented by ``revert(string("msg"))``? Or whenever the argument can be compile-time evaluated in general? Or would this even be a new function ``revertFormat`` (given  #7365)?

It would be a compiler switch and yes, it could only be used for string literals.

We now have custom errors, which satisfy the goal of having meaningful, recognizable errors without embedding the whole message in the bytecode, so I think we can close this.
