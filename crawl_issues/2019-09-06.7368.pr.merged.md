I added a 0.7.0 project and staged https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7369 there, i.e. remove the old reporter with 0.7.0.

~~Ah right... command line tests... hadn't thought about that...~~ Should work now.

Weird - the failing command line test passes for me locally...
EDIT: ah - I had a prerelease.txt in the source tree I ran it on.

Ok - figuring out how to remove the trailing empty new line with OS X ``sed`` took a ridiculously long time, but this should now be fine. I also checked again locally in the presence of a ``prerelease.txt`` and that seems to work as well.

By the way: should we have an artifical release build and test run with a prerelease.txt?

Yes, please create a run with prerelease file.
