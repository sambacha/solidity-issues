https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7368 enables the new error reporter, but keeps the old one as command line option. It should be removed with the next breaking release.

@franzihei is asking truffle if they have any problem with this.

Feedback from Truffle: It shouldn't be too much of a problem for them on their end. They thank us very much for checking with them and giving a heads up on this. :)

I probably won't get around to finish this this month, so I'm unassigning myself.
I could push the part I have, i.e. removing the command line options itself, but that can be re-done quickly anyways - the main part of this will be to have a look at all other usages of the old error reporter outside the CLI and check if we can and want to replace those by the new one as well (which would be a prerequisite to remove the code entirely).

StandardCompiler still uses the old one -- should we consider changing that too?
