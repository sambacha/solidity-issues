~~``test/CMakeList.txt`` itself still uses ``GLOB``s to fetch the sources - that should be changed.~~ [Update: that part's not true anymore]

We need to decide, whether we consider it dangerous that we might miss files and thus not run the tests in it - but we could just still *also* GLOB and create a cmake error, if there is a source file in the glob that's not in the explicit list of sources. [Update: we could still do this, though, if we deem it necessary - I wouldn't say it's too important, though]

Also ``isoltest`` adds most of the sources used by ``soltest`` as well - all of them will needlessly be compiled twice - they should probably end up in something like ``libsoltest``. [Update: this we still need in any case]

We should better split code in proper libraries, too, especially in the test directory.

I don't see GLOB anymore -- is this issue still valid?

This is a valid problem though, right?

Exactly - we removed the ``GLOB``s, but there's still no ``libsoltest`` or sth like that, i.e. it's still a bit of a mess and stuff is compiled multiple times.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
