# [\#7379 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7379) `merged`: [YulOpt] Create SSA variable after control flow joins

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10496191?v=4" width="50">[sifmelcara](https://github.com/sifmelcara) opened issue at [2019-09-09 07:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7379):

Closes #7354 

1. How do we check/ensure that SSA transform is still reversible? It doesn't change fullSuite/ssaAndBack test's result so I guess it's still reversible.

2. I made `ForLoopInitRewriter` be a prerequisite of SSA Transformer, is this fine?

3. It also unnecessarily insert SSA variable declarations right after `struct Block` statement, although no actual control flow joins there. This cannot be avoided without refactor the code since value mapping is cleaned at the end of each `Block`.

4. Seems like existing test cases already covers this PR's change quite well, so no new test case added.

5. Changelog not updated because this change is not visible to user.

I have the impression that this pull request can still be simplified.

I'm sorry, but I'm still feeling a bit uneasy about this transform. Let me try to split the original SSA transform into two distinct steps and then let's see if that would make this addition easier. Sorry for the hassle!

Please don't worry! I agree it is cumbersome in its current state. After the refactor it should be easier to add feature on top of SSATransformer. I guess I will open another PR to replace this PR after the refactor PR being merged
