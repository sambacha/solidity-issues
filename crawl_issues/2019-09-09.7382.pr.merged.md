Closes #6040 

Simply adds those keywords to the reserved-keywords list, adjusting documentation and ChangeLog to it.

There is a `/docs/050-breaking-changes.rst` but none for 0.6.0 yet, at lest I didn't find any changelog in the docs/ folder for 0.6.0 just yet - maybe someone can give me a hint in case I overlooked that, so I can adapt that.

This should target the ``develop_060`` branch. Did we actually agree on ``copy``? I think the naming isn't even clear yet between ``copy``, ``copyof`` and ``clone`` and this is probably postponed until 0.7 anyways, so do we need to reserve it now?

I don't think we should reserve copy at the current time.

Okay, so only `virtual` then.

> I'd be fine with merging this - although we will actually implement virtual for 0.6.0 anyways (at least I hope we will :-)), so we might as well skip this and just add it as real keyword once we do that.

I'm just walking through some tickets in the ToDo lane. I know that @Marenz is working on `override`, and I think that this doesn't interfere. In case we want to implement some `virtual`-semantics (given enough time before [special-date-here] 0.6.0 release, then we can still do so :-)
