Looks good apart from the one comment!

Added yul optimizer tests for the newly created rules. 

@chriseth Should I add legacy optimizer tests as well here?

If that is not too much work, you can try a legacy optimizer test that uses `create` but takes its argument from the stack after a jumpdest, so that the argument is not directly visible.

> jumpdest

Currently investigating how I can get past the following failure

```
test/libevmasm/Optimiser.cpp(74): fatal error: in "Optimiser/cse_create_mask": critical check cse.feedItems(input.begin(), input.end(), usesMsize) == input.end() has failed
```

caused most likely by the second condition here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/96b6b4565801fc52997ea212edcb695eefc36315/libevmasm/SemanticInformation.cpp#L72

because `create` contains `> 2` arguments

The create2 yul optimizer test was failing because the builtin is only available `>= constantinople`. This is now fixed.
