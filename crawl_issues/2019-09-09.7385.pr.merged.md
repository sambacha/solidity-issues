Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3198.

Main things missing:
  What to do about solc-js and external tests? Update solc-js repo?
  Recheck documentation.
  Do we need more tests?

Taking this out of draft mode - it's not entirely ready, but I'd say it's getting close, and some review might be good.
Might be good if someone takes over for the rest, since I'll be off for a while.

@ekpyron I did the review mostly to myself. I'll fix the comments that I wrote.

@leonardoalt Yep, I just thought some comments from me having written the current version might help you in finishing this - and I just had a few minutes time :-)!

Yep, for sure! Thanks!

I rechecked docs and I think tests are also fine.

Main question now is regarding solc-js and external tests.

Also another review wouldn't hurt ;)

Ok, still override related test failures - I'll fix.
