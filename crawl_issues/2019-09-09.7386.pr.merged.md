Closes #5992.

### TODO
* [x] Defaulting to *strict* inline assembly
* [x] ChangeLog entry
* [x] The tests still need to be finished adapting
* [x] Yul AST cleanup
* [x] Squash meaningfully into topic commits.

### Notes
* [x] consider removing: Expression(FunctionalInstruction)
* [x] consider removing: Statement(Instruction)
Those two will be done in seperate PR (rebased on top of this one)

This also needs some cleanup in the yul ast.
