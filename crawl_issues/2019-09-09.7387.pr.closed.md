# [\#7387 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7387) `closed`: [DOCS] Add AST output

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1511

I wanted to get a PR open to discuss the best way to organise the information and fill in any gaps of nodes I have missed. There's not many standard ways to document AST outputs, so we have a lot of flexibility on how we can do it. I also think that an example with a diagram and the output would be useful.

I'm also not sure if the "child nodes" section for each node is helpful, or more reflective of the examples I have generated.

But generally feedback welcome on how we organise this information and what nodes and details might be missing.

Oh this is a horrible amount of work! :)
I think we should mainly document the output of ``solc --ast-compact-json``

> "I'm also not sure if the "child nodes" section for each node is helpful

Hmm, I think it would be helpful to have a brief explainer for all types of fields a node has. On the other hand, most of them have very obvious names (e.g. referenced Declarations), so that giving them an extra sentence might read weirdly and bloat the docs. Maybe you could do write out the children section for two nodes as an example. I would not refer to them as "children"-nodes though, as that what happens in the legacy-AST. I'd prefer "fields"

Also, there are a lot of references to ID which are not part of the AST. Those are pseudo-ASTNodes creating by parsing magicVariables, such as ```this, msg.sender, block.time```. So a note saying why those IDs do not exist would be in order somewhere. 

(atm, I am also working on assigning those dedicated negative IDs, I'll reference it here, once this is done. Just wanted to leave a reminder)

one idea would be that we document it the same way as we are doing for the standard-json input and output: A json-object as an example with inline comments. A brief summary + the piece of code that generated the json + info which is not particular to any of the fields could go above.

@chriseth My only instruction was to look at `ast.h`, which is what I didâ€¦ Hopefully this is all useful somewhere. And as this is a new file, I thought one large commit would be fine, not sure how else to do it really!

What do you actually mean by this?

@djudjuu 

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7387#issuecomment-530745066

Do you mean like in `using-the-compiler.rst`? The main issue I find with documenting the AST output is that there are so many potential nodes, I have a series of example contracts I've been using to generate examples for me to work from which could cover a lot of cases, and I guess people can figure out the rest?

I'll look at some of your other comments too once we clear up some of these simpler ones.

@djudjuu Changed to fields, I agreed with that. I disagree with things being obvious though, we have had some feedback from people attempting to use the AST and not understanding it. Granted that was because there was _no_ documentation, but still, being overly clear doesn't hurt.

just leaving a note that the AST-output for inline assembly will change with #2419, once #7537 is merged.

Look into test suite inside `test/libsolidity/astjson/` for examples of input and output

Thanks @Marenz this is nowhere near finished, so formatting not finalised :)

OK, I've reworked this after feedback from @djudjuu a few weeks ago, and made it more like other examples in the "Using the compiler" section. A few remaining points:

- Even with a small code example, the AST output is really long, not sure what to do about that, open to ideas.
- Some of the definitions below are missing descriptions, as I wasn't sure what they represented, and couldn't find anything in the code base either.
- Another option is to move the explanations into code comments, which won't help with the length issue, but consolidates things

I feel moving it into the comments is best...
Note that I had to do some more changes based on 060 to the output..
