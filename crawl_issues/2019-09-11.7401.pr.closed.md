Having implemented this by tracking values of variables in an internal map, I actually think that it might be safer to implement it by inserting assignments in the following way:

```
if x { revert(0, 0) }
```
is transformed to
```
if x { revert(0, 0) }
x := 0
```

This has the downside that it destroys SSA form, but the benefit that we do not have to care about control flow in this PR.

I think to properly fix this, we need a "reverser" step.

This step should be combined as follows:
 - conditional simplifier
 - (other simplifiers)
 - literal rematerializer
 - conditional simplifier reverser
