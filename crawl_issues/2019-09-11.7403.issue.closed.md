We should be able to optimize
```
let a := calldataload(0)
let x := mload(a)
let z := mload(a)
sstore(0, sub(x, z))
```
into
```
sstore(0, 0)
```
but CSE cannot tell that `mload(a)` and `mload(a)` are the same (because it the expression is not movable).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
