fixes #7248 

In draft mode because I still haven't figured out how to properly link solidity against libc++ the way, oss-fuzz builder does (CC https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/2826)

I'm not sure we should be linking against libc++ though. This image is sufficient to build solidity and run tests.

Oops, I meant to make this draft mode but didn't actually do. Now I don't know how to switch this to draft :-)

This PR is ready for review. Once it is merged, I will push the new clang docker image upstream and use it here (instead of the ubuntu 19.04 base image). The main difference being the clang docker image builds all solidity deps (including z3) via clang version 8.

@ekpyron Could you please remind me why we need to build z3 statically? I guess it is better to have a common policy on how to build solidity dependencies i.e., statically or shared libraries. Right now it's a bit of a mess :-)

The general policy is *always* to build against shared libraries unless there's a good reason not to.
The "good reason" for Z3 is that debian and consequently ubuntu haven't updated their Z3 packages in over a decade or so - and thus are stuck on 4.4 whereas we hard-require at least 4.6+ and 4.8+ is even better. And we don't want to pollute end-users systems with requiring to install non-stock shared libraries that might be incompatible with other software - hence static Z3. Might not seem like it, but it's in fact the cleanest way to do things ;-). Any user who wants to build from sources can just install a newer version of shared Z3 and that's fine (i.e. we don't *require* static linking against Z3, we just require a newer version and we provide that newer version for the release build statically and thus also use it for our test runs to avoid surprises).

I.e. it would be perfectly valid to have a separate docker image for the clang build that contains a 
*shared* z3 library and link against that, since we won't use the same configuration for releases anyways, so no reason to use static linking for these builds.
