# [\#7422 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7422) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Refactor CHC.cpp a bit more

Ideally it could be refactored such that:
- `m_currentBlock` is used instead of `m_path`
- Disassociate ASTNodes from predicates, such that predicates don't depend at all on the SSA index of a `SymbolicFunctionVariable`.
- For the above to be possible we might need to keep things locally in a single function. For example, moving the content of `endVisit(FunctionDefinition)` into the end of `visit(FunctionDefinition)`, after `SMTEncoder::visit(FunctionDefinition)`.
- Unique names can be simply generated by a class counter, or still from the ASTNode ids if things are done locally.
