In 0.6.0 we implemented array slices for dynamic calldata arrays.
We should also support them at least for dynamic memory arrays and maybe even for dynamic storage arrays. This will require more involved changes, though, since while calldata array slices and dynamic calldata arrays have the exact same stack layout and type conversion is a no-op, this won't be the case for memory and storage.
We could also think about the case of static arrays combined with slicing.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Would be cool to have it for storage, can do with Solidity libs nowadays

What would you say about having new array access modifiers?
- `storage slice`
- `memory slice`

Which would have 2 variables on stack, similar to `calldata` offset and length?

Where `storage` and `memory` could have auto-cast to sliced versions.
