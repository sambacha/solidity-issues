Actually I was not even aware in the beginning about how specific this pattern is.

Note that you need ``div(x, shl(y, 1))`` where neither `x` nor `y` can be constants or variables and both have to be functions or opcodes with side-effects that conflict when swapped and this expression needs to be part of a loop condition...
