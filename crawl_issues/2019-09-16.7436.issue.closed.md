We disabled the style checker test in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7435 with 0.6.0 because it was not updated to our syntax changes.

@chriseth Are all the changes documented somewhere? I should probably also let the teams behind solhint etc know about the changes. Or make a PR to their projects.

They are more or less explained here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop_060/docs/060-breaking-changes.rst

This is blocked by https://github.com/protofire/solhint/issues/170 (solhint updating to 0.6.0)

This was only done for the docs, but it would be nice to run it on the tests too.

Can we reenable this?

Please no style enforcement on the tests. This is bad for the syntax tests and also limits us in the semantic tests.

I meant only for semantic tests, but what does it limit there?

It just takes more time to format it properly.

At this point this basically requires going through most examples and doing tediuos style fixes. I even see some crashes (e.g. `RangeError: index parameter must be between >= 0 and <= number of children.`).

I'm going to mark this as `good first issue`, with the goal being to clean up the examples first before we re-enable the job.

For anone who'd like to take it, here's a short snippet that can be executed from repo root to automatically run solhint on all docs snippets:
```bash
mkdir -p solhint/docs-examples/
cp test/.solhintignore test/.solhint.json solhint/
cd solhint/docs-examples/
../../scripts/isolate_tests.py ../../docs/
cd ..
npm install solhint
for snippet in docs-examples/*.sol; do
    npx solhint -f unix $snippet
done
```

We will accept PRs that clean up some or all of what solhint reports.

Reopening because we still have that disabled style checker job. We should either clean up the examples or remove the commented out job from CI config.
