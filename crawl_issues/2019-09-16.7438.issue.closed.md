## Description

Synthesize examples to cover the following lines of code not yet hit by the fuzzer

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/DataFlowAnalyzer.cpp#L345

never returns `false`. Why the Data flow analyzer finds no variables in function scope is beyond me.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/ExpressionJoiner.cpp#L115

`m_currentBlock` is never null (good candidate to convert into an assertion)

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/ExpressionSimplifier.cpp#L46

is never true (~~this is suspicious~~). This is because expression splitter being run before simplifier makes it impossible to satisfy the branch (see #7659)

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/FullInliner.cpp#L205-L214

is never executed

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/FunctionGrouper.cpp#L35

is never true

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/FunctionGrouper.cpp#L57-L60

never executed

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/Metrics.cpp#L38-L50

Code size of expression/statement never evaluated

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/54d936dda839c690f6acd3b7b7c61280aaeffa05/libyul/optimiser/VarDeclInitializer.cpp#L38-L52

never executed

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/31cd9d364dbe03c354a1dcd9603a4c6c2518f64c/libyul/optimiser/ConditionalSimplifier.cpp#L32-L36

is never executed

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/31cd9d364dbe03c354a1dcd9603a4c6c2518f64c/libyul/optimiser/UnusedPruner.cpp#L51

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
