# [\#7440 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7440) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Refactor CHC a bit more

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7422 #7131 

This PR refactors/simplifies how blocks are constructed/used in CHC.
Consequently, it also adds small blocks for `if`. Now SSA variables are not merged at all and each small block can start with all indices 0.
It also implements support for loop break/continue (only a few extra lines).

I think we don't need to figure out the z3 stuff for this PR

If we get the tests to just pass here for now (i.e. use old z3 expectations), then we don't, that's true.

I think you just un-rebased-it though or something - it now has Changelog conflicts in any case.

They were passing before the rebase, that's why I mentioned it should be fine
