@chriseth @mijovic isn't this solved with #10765 given it uses `reasonIfDebug`? Or is this issue more generic to strip any message supplied? If so, why don't we have specific tests for this? Would need a flag in the test format for it ðŸ˜“

I am not sure what exactly was meant by "revert string stripping", so am not really sure if it will be solved by #10765

Don't we have an option that strips revert strings even if they are user-supplied?
