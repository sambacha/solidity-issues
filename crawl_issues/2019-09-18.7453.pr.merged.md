# [\#7453 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7453) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Add "as const: function to SMTLib2Interface

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2019-09-18 20:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7453):

Forgot to add this to `SMTLib2Interface` when added to Z3 and CVC4.

This function needs to be handled separately because it actually uses 2 functions: `((as const <Sort>) <value>)`
`(as const <Sort>)` takes a sort as an argument and returns the function that actually takes the value and finally returns a const array.

Changed the logic to `ALL` because `Z3` doesn't like `QF_AUFLIA` with `(as const)` and `CVC4` issues warnings if no logic is used.

I tested this on the upcoming `solc-js` PR that runs the `smtCheckerTests` via the `SMTLib2Interface`.
