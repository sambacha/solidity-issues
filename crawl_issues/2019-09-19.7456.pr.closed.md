Removed the below line:
`This mechanism exists to avoid high gas costs when returning an entire array.`
As it contradicts with the idea of reading from blockchain causes no gas.

### Description

Reading causes no gas, however, in the documentation it states that `If you have a public state variable of array type, then you can only retrieve single elements of the array via the generated getter function. This mechanism exists to avoid high gas costs when returning an entire array.`
**Thus, there is a contradiction, hence created this PR.**

`Instead of **returns** added **public view returns** to the reading functions`

Since this hasn't been updated for a while now, I'll take it over.

Closing this now, since the broken source extraction will be fixed with #7564 and the documentation update tracked with #7565.
