Needs rebase and failing tests need fixing. ping @sifmelcara

(rebased and fixes compilation error) Still need to address the rematerializer issue mentioned in #7345 before working on this I guess

Would love to see the effect of this on "real world" code!

@sifmelcara I would really like this to get merged. Do you have time in the next days - otherwise we can finish it.

Unfortunately I don't think I have time... Sorry for that. Please take over, thank you!

No worries! Thanks a lot for your work so far!

The current rules are:
```
	// A declaration can be promoted iff
	// 1. Its LHS is a SSA variable
	// 2. Its RHS does not references variables declared in current scope
	// 3. Its RHS is movable
```

I think 2 is too weak: If the RHS references a variable that is (re-)assigned in the current loop, we cannot promote the declaration.

I think pseudo-SSA is assumed in this context so this rule is correct

@sifmelcara I think especially in loops, you cannot avoid referencing non-ssa variables even in pseudo-ssa form. I will tighten the condition such that only ssa variables can be referenced and I think this will not degrade the performance too much exactly because of pseudo-ssa.

The changes to the rematerializer are in #7801
