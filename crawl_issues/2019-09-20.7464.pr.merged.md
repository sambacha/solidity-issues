`soltest` is currently showing different test results in macOS and Linux. 

On macOS `soltest` fails because of lower-case/upper-case issues inside hexadecimal numbers, see https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/180943?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link .

I just hacked ` .circleci/soltest.sh` to show the different test results. I didn't integrated `evmone` for macOS. I also saw, that the the `soltest` cannot be executed with `--evm-version=$EVM `, because `$EVM` seem not be set with a correct `EVM` version value. I didn't investigated this problem further.

@axic what was the reason we actually didn't have tests on osx?

We don't have tests on macos because we did not want to run aleth on macos (this reason is gone now) and because the bytecode comparison tests should be enough.

This seems to because by the fact that shifting a u256 onto a stream behaves differently depending on the platform.

@chriseth I did a brief look at  bytecode comparison tests. It looks like that the output of macOS versions is never compared - because it doesn't exist... with the difference in the behaviour found here, it may be dangerous

Not that we did not want to, but that we couldn't :wink: Anyway as you say that problem is finally gone.

Hmm.. I still think that it is very important to integrate macOS tests to CI.. I can still only recommend to execute tests in as many different contexts as possible.. I would integrate the missing `evmone` stuff, if I find some time..

@chriseth @axic do you see any problem why this should not be done?

@leonardoalt there are two test-cases related to SMT that seem to behave differently in the context of macOS, see https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/191297?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link

@aarlt do you know which SMT solvers/versions are being used? The SMTChecker tests need Z3 4.8.5 to pass, otherwise they should be disabled with `--no-smt`.

I integrated the `Z3 4.8.5` and `evmone`. The only failing test is now the one related to the upper/lowercase issue within `jsoncpp`.. see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7468#issuecomment-548886743 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7568#issuecomment-547367039

@chriseth @axic @Marenz what about fixing this `jsoncpp` issue by using a case-insensitive compare?

I should have merged it into `develop` after all, but can you try to cherry-pick this commit and see if it fixes your failing test? https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/6705420325ef012d5c7ca786d040955a5e94a705

We should definitely have this test run, but I see a few issues with this PR:
- ~~it adds CI specific paths to the user-facing ``soltest.sh`` script~~ Damn, I'm blind, it's the CI specific script, so nevermind that...
- it triggers two distinct CI build runs for MacOS, instead of reusing the binaries from the build only run for the test run

I think we should rather ignore the Z3 issue and use ``--no-smt`` in a test run that reuses the binaries from the build run until we decide how to deal with Z3 4.8.6.

Another alternative would be to just make brew install Z3 4.8.5 for now... EDIT: not possible since there's no brew recipe for it apparently

> * it triggers two distinct CI build runs for MacOS, instead of reusing the binaries from the build only run for the test run

@ekpyron we could change `b_osx` to set `CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH`, `CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` and `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` appropriately.. so that the build will know where to find `z3`.. then it could be reused..

is it correct for `cirlcleci/config.yml` to define the dependency to `b_osx` like:
```
  t_osx_soltest: &t_osx_soltest
    <<: *b_osx
```
or is it needed to change `b_osx` to
```
  b_osx: &b_osx
```
so that the dependency declaration works?

I would also move `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the `config.yml` like
```
 environment:
      EVM: constantinople
      OPTIMIZE: 0
      TERM: xterm
      CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH: /Users/distiller/project/z3/bin
      CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH: /Users/distiller/project/z3/bin
      DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH: /Users/distiller/project/z3/bin
      CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH: /Users/distiller/project/z3/include
```
if this works...

@ekpyron hmm.. i just realised that `brew` is always using `/usr/local`.. i think that access issue was  not related to `/usr/local`, it was related to `/usr/lib`.. so probably we could get rid of the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` hack

@axic @chriseth some general notes about current CI:
- `LLL` tests are never executed `-DLLL=on` - tests seem to be faulty
- `run_soltest_all` seem never be executed

@aarlt ``run_soltest_all`` is the default and it is executed - but it's not easy to see that in the circleci config, since there is a label being overwritten...

Oh, that's too bad. It was turned on CI but it seems it was removed some time ago :(
