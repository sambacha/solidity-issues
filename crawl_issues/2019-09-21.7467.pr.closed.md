# [\#7467 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7467) `closed`: replace boost::optional by std::optional (C++17)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91535?v=4" width="50">[theStack](https://github.com/theStack) opened issue at [2019-09-21 19:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7467):

### Description

Fixes one of three tasks of #7259 (_Replace boost constructs with their C++17 STL equivalents._)

The replacement was done in three steps, one commit each:

1. automatic replacements through find/sed commands in all .cpp and .h files (`#include <boost/optional.hpp>` -> `#include <optional>`, `boost::optional` -> `std::optional`, `boost::make_optional` -> `std::make_optional`, `boost::none` -> `std::nullopt`)
2. manual replacements of functions to test for initialization and get value (`boost::optional::is_initialized()` -> `std::optional::has_value()`, `boost::optional::get()` -> `std::optional::value()`)

3. manual replacements for conditional `boost::make_optional()` (there is no equivalent in std::optional C++17, see commit message for further explanation)

Compilation tested with clang 6.0.0. Running tests via `./scripts/test.sh` leads to 21 SolidityTests failures:
`*** 21 failures are detected in the test module "SolidityTests"`
but the number was exactly the same as for the latest commit in branch _develop_, hence I conclude that this PR doesn't break anything.

Oh no, as the Travis run shows, this doesn't compile with g++, failing on the file `libyul/backends/wasm/WordSizeTransform.cpp`. Should have tested it with more than just clang. Unfortunately I can't make any sense of the many-pages-long template error messages, the only thing I can deduce that there seems to be some problem with `boost::variant`. Any help to resolve this is appreciated.

I think this is superseded by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7551, isn't it? Can we close this then? @christianparpart

Closing this now since all required changes are done in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7551.
