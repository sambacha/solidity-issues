# [\#7470 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7470) `merged`: Removes the optionality on `output` in ABI docs.

I _believe_ (someone more knowledgable than I should verify this claim) that Solidity will always write out an `output` member.  If there are no return parameters, then the array will be empty, but the `output` property will be present.

If this is not correct, I will withdraw this PR, but if the assertion is correct then the docs should reflect that so people can rely on the `output` property being present when writing ABI processors.

I also fixed some inconsistency in line termination character.  It was sometimes `.` and sometimes `;`.  I picked `.`, but don't really care which as long as it is consistent.

Just because Solidity will always put an empty array does not mean that all other languages should do the same. Maybe Solidity should stop using empty arrays there.

Opinions?

Does the abi spec also specify the layout of the JSON file that describes it (the ABI)?

As far as I know (I definitely may be wrong here), the Solidity docs effectively _are_ the ABI specification.  I'm a fan of strict specifications rather than loose ones, and think that an empty array is strongly preferable to "mabye an empty array, maybe undefined, maybe null, maybe an array with items".

If there is no spec beyond the Solidity docs, and no other known languages produce the ABI with an empty array, then I think there is value in narrowing the docs now (before someone starts doing something else).

Separately, these docs are for Solidity, not Vyper/other so if they do something different :shrug:, that is their problem.  ðŸ˜„ (also, they should be better and return an empty array).

I agree with @MicahZoltu
