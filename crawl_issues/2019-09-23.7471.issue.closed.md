## Description

Is there merit in enabling yul optimizer in compiler stack settings (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7446/files#diff-6705b87d569995601f337962eef489ddR97)

given that we have a standalone yul optimizer fuzzer?

This can be done via `setOptimiserSettings(OptimiserSettings _settings);` or did I misunderstand the question?

Actually, the question is should we do it rather than how to do it. I think the how essentially involves changing the configuration setting.

To rephrase, will be benefit from a fuzzer that compiles solidity via yul? If so, I can reopen https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7446

I think not yet.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
