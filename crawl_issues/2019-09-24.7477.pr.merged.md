Or a boost version issue?

Or libc++/libstdc++?

I can highly recommend to build everything with as many different compilers as possible and run all resulting tests including its sanitized versions. It may also be useful to build the stuff with different standard libraries.

I'm not sure why CI runs are still pending.

@chriseth in the clang docker image, boost version is higher but it doesn't use libc++.
