This was removed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7205, but is apparently still needed for a static build.
Not sure if we should merge this into the release branch or how to deal with this now...
I started a build to check if this works here: https://launchpad.net/~ekpyron/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-experimental/+build/17833626

I'm retargeting this to develop, since it's probably too late, resp. too hacky to merge this to release. It should be straightforward to inject this change in the release_ppa script to get a succeeding static build for 0.5.12.

Patching ``release_ppa.sh`` like this: https://gist.github.com/ekpyron/3fbf7f12bd732d8157b31b1a37c9d85a should produce a working static 0.5.12 build, if run on against the ``v0.5.12`` branch (i.e. with ``v0.5.12`` as argument).
