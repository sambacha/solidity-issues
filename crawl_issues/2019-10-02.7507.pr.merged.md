Use `jsonPrettyPrint` for printing JSON AST, so that trailing spaces are not added in JSON output.

Nice! Can you please squash the changes to the expectation files into a single commit?

Ah, sorry! I just noticed after merging that it was against the wrong branch.

Isn't `develop_060` the right branch to merge against? I thought that the issue was introduced in `develop_060` according to this comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7373#issue-490285021.

The test file that was causing the issue is not excluded in the branch `develop`, so I assumed that this issue is not happening in the `develop` branch.

"Came up in #7372" just referred to that we realized it while discussing/working on #7372.
