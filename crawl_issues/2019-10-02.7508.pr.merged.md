# [\#7508 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7508) `merged`: Prevent build path from ending up in binaries.

Where supported this change will replace the source path in ``__FILE__`` macros (implicitly used during our assertions) with ``/solidity``, whenever this is supported by the compiler.

Almost fixes, i.e. refs https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6230
In a stripped binary there's still some references to the source path remaining caused by json-cpp, which is built as an external subproject, so we'd need more involved checks for compiler support (resp. force a specific compiler for the subproject).

This is a step towards reproducible binaries and will reduce binary size.

What compiler supports this? clang on macos surely doesn't. Is it gcc only?

So I would have expected osx clang to support this - but maybe they're stuck with ancient versions again ;-). It should be there for over a year now (https://reviews.llvm.org/D49466). MSVC is a different matter, though. In any case: better to do this whereever possible than not doing it. Stuff like this is platform specific anyways.
