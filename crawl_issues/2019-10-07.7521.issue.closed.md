## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

The abi generated for the following contract is missing the `values` array for the `records` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.12;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract Contract {
    struct Record {
        address owner;
        string[] values;
    }
    
    mapping(string => Record) public records;

    function getRecord(string memory id) public returns(Record memory) {
        return records[id];
    }
}
```

ABI:

```json
[
	{
		"constant": false,
		"inputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "string",
				"name": "id",
				"type": "string"
			}
		],
		"name": "getRecord",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"components": [
					{
						"internalType": "address",
						"name": "owner",
						"type": "address"
					},
					{
						"internalType": "string[]",
						"name": "values",
						"type": "string[]"
					}
				],
				"internalType": "struct Contract.Record",
				"name": "",
				"type": "tuple"
			}
		],
		"payable": false,
		"stateMutability": "nonpayable",
		"type": "function"
	},
	{
		"constant": true,
		"inputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "string",
				"name": "",
				"type": "string"
			}
		],
		"name": "records",
		"outputs": [
			{
				"internalType": "address",
				"name": "owner",
				"type": "address"
			}
		],
		"payable": false,
		"stateMutability": "view",
		"type": "function"
	}
]
```

I would expect the `getRecord` and `records` abi definitions to be the same.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.12
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): compiler default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:
