No, I am not familiar with testing. Where should I run solc --ir? Do I have to build all project somehow, etc?

Yes, you have to build everything, then put this in a file called `x.sol`:
```
contract c {
function f() external pure returns (string memory) { return "abcabc"; }
}
```
and run `solc --ir x.sol` and check the output. Of course `solc` either has to be in your path or you specify the full path to the binary in a subdirectory of the `build` directory.

I took over this PR and finished it, but apparently not allowed to pushed to the fork. So I'll open another PR.
