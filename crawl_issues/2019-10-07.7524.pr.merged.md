# [\#7524 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7524) `merged`: Allow splitting string literals into multiple parts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8301939?u=060d490609ac976cf8c8a00765260a5ba932f53d&v=4" width="50">[ghallak](https://github.com/ghallak) opened issue at [2019-10-07 20:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7524):

This should work for both normal and hex string literals, and the splitting can be done either on the same line or on multiple lines.

Closes #7292

@erak I have modified in this commit 9eb109626a11d275cc6fcb204d4f09b3301040eb `Scanner::scanHexString` to accept a sequence of hex string literals in a way that will solve both of the problems that you've mentioned above.

I tried to do the same in `Scanner::scanString` but that caused the command line test `standard_yul_embedded_object_name` to fail, because in this line: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/5ea1d90f9814fb56870d87a80460b8d06bf73f1f/test/cmdlineTests/standard_yul_embedded_object_name/input.json#L7
`\"DataName\" \"abc\"` is being parsed as a single string `DataNameabc` which is not correct.

Now, both the scanner (to allow multipart hex string literals) and the parser (to allow multipart regular string literals) are modified. Can this be done better (probably by modifying either the scanner or the parser, not both)?

@ghallak Great, thanks. I think the implementation is fine. I've tested your changes and found out, that `hex"aa" hex"ZZ" "cc"` is still allowed, but we need to return an error here. 

Could you also please add more syntax test for hex string literals?
