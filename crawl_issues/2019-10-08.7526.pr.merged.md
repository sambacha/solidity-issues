@gnidan 
@haltman-at  can we merge this as it is into 0.6.0?

I don't see why not.  Of course, it remains to be seen to what extent this fixes all our problems!  I can certainly use it to fix the duplicate modifier problem, but I'll probably have to do some work to check that I can in fact fix the parameters problem with it.  But I'm assuming that with this information there ought to be *some* way to make it all work, regardless of the details. :)  Thanks again for this!
