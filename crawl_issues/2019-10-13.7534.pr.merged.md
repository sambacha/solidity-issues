### Description
Addresses #1141 

Adds an object similar to the one used to document `params` only if multiple named return parameters are specified. Otherwise the `return` field will contain a single string.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary(?)
- [x] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Please also add a Changelog entry since this is a user-facing change that will effect tools.

> I think we need to revisit the concept again. E.g. We should also take the first word of the line and check if this corresponds to named return parameter, if any. If return parameters don't have a name, this check should be ignored.

Would it make sense to have this method perform that check and throw an error? It might be cleaner to reuse the current logic in the doc parser for `param` adding the `return` case for `parseDocTag`.  Though this would break most contract documentation i.e. the gnosis contract examples, no?

@gh1dra Yes, I think we should use the same logic as we do for function parameters. And yes, you're right. This would break existing contracts that use named return parameters (and that probably do not use the parameter name as the first word). But since the current behaviour is broken, I'd tend to properly clean it up and include this PR in our next breaking release, which will be 0.6.0.

The failing macOS build (`b_osx`) should be gone after a rebase, which will include https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7552.

@gh1dra Great, thanks! I left a few comments that should be easy to fix. And I also changed the base branch to `develop_060` since it's breaking. Could you please rebase your changes on top of it as well?
We need an entry in `solidity_repo/docs/060-breaking-changes.rst`  as well. You can run the HTML generation with `./scripts/docs.sh`.

@erak Thanks for the feedback! Let me know if you'd like me to squash the earlier commits.

@gh1dra I've read through it again carefully and found some small issues. I think we can agree on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7534#discussion_r339732570 quickly and incorporate the outcome. Otherwise your PR looks really good and I'm looking forward to get it merged.

The branch should be rebased properly now, apologies for the confusion
