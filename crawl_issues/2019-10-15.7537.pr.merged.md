### Description
resolves #2419 

creates different kinds of Json nodes for each kind of AsmData-struct.
similar to the solidityAST, there is a "nodeType" field and a "src"-location. 

Goal: It should be possible to recreate the AsmData from the Json.

TEST added: I added a contract with a bunch of inlineAssembly (assebly.sol from the syntaxTests) to ```/test/libsolidity/ASTJSON```
Then I ran the testsuite and used its output from the error-message to create ```assembly.json``` and ```assembly_legacy.json```.

HELP NEEDED: All test that fail are related to the fuzzer testing soljson. 

I don't really know how to debug that or make sense of it. any pointers?

UPDATE: All solved

@djudjuu I didn't take a look at all failures. One failure that I spent some time on is from the `t_ubu_release_cli` that looks like so

```
Invalid error: "InternalCompilerError"
Fuzzer failed on test_254ca6c11f2f9744a828fdf899fa357a2bff321ec25630224b2ce8a4031b9a04_solidityendtoendtest_cpp.solInvalid error: "InternalCompilerError"
Fuzzer failed on test_5897c478c6ab519fb05b145b1fcbc940d8b3ebaa7e9b65b1fec7c2033e29d60b_solidityendtoendtest_cpp.solxargs: /root/project/build/test/tools/solfuzzer: terminated by signal 11
Exited with code 123
```

What I tried to do is the following
  - Located failing print to here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/302a51a58ce39b17a187113e6048c6ea380bc7ce/test/cmdlineTests.sh#L435-L446
  - Since the failing test is obfuscated by a hash string, added a print statement in the `isolate_scripts.py` script here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/302a51a58ce39b17a187113e6048c6ea380bc7ce/scripts/isolate_tests.py#L74
  - Located the failing solidity test case (corresponding to the error output test_254ca6c11f2f9744a828fdf899fa357a2bff321ec25630224b2ce8a4031b9a04_solidityendtoendtest_cpp) to be this https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/302a51a58ce39b17a187113e6048c6ea380bc7ce/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp#L9848-L9860

One option to debug this specific failure further is to copy paste the highlighted solidity test case into a standalone file and run it against solfuzzer. My guess is that the run should failure with an internal compiler error, and then you can debug the issue further. Hope this helps you :)

Please retarget to 0.6.0 - I think this might break some tools.

I retargeted it, but I can't retrigger the tests

Why does it sometimes use (*this)(...) and sometimes boost::apply_visitor(*this, ...);?: Depends on whether the argument is a variant (then you have to use apply_visitor), or a specific type (then `(*this)(...)` has to be used).
