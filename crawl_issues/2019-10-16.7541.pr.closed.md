Could you please squash it into a single commit?

@hellraiserinchief Could you please rebase? We just fixed the broken MacOS build on Circle which led to the failing test on this PR.

Yeah, help would be welcome, I am new to contributing to OSS

I have tried combined the commits into a single commit, please have a look and advice.

Sorry, I fear you have to rebase again, the macos version change should be part of a different PR.

As @chriseth already mentioned, this needs to be rebased again, such that the changes to `.circleci/config.yaml` are not part of the PR. Also, since your working on `develop` of your fork, I'd strongly recommend to create a branch in your forked repository, and then open a PR with our `develop` as the target and your branch as the source. Your current workflow might lead to issues when trying to keep your fork up to date. Please see https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork for further advice.

@erak, I will follow your advice and create a new branch to submit a new PR, instead of using the develop branch directly
