poke as this hasn't seen activity for a while @chriseth

@Marenz this was a proof-of-concept PR which is slowly being rewritten and merged into develop in multiple pull requests. Progress is tracked via the checkboxes in the PR description.

Can this be rebased to see what's left in it? Or would rebasing be painful (and not very useful)?

Rebasing is mostly impossible. I'll create new PRs soon.

@chriseth is there anything left here really?

Yes, actually running the rule list on wasm code, for example. All the unticked boxes in the description are still "to do".

Rebased this and pushed here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/wasmBinary-rebase

At least the missing changes are visible.

Nice, thanks!

Have you checked it? Likely it doesn't compile because I haven't fixed namespaces/paths. Should I push it here?

This was a quick-and-dirty-try-to-see-if-it-works-at-all thing. The optimizer changes need to be extracted with care.

Ok but should I push the rebase here?

yes, please

The only thing left over here is the changes to the rule list, but I think that can be easily recreated (and maybe should).
