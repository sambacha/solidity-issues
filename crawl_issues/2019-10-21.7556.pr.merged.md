I think it would be better to do that inside the syntax checker instead of the type checker - it is responsible for validating that certain elements of the AST are in certain places.

Repeating what I said in the chat: This is problematic as we don't have the type information at that stage

Conceptually, this is not about types but about kinds of declarations. So we do not need types but just resolved identifiers. I think we should take care not to clutter the state of TypeChecker - at best it should not have any state.

Another fix would be to just ignore the type in the code generator - it has a proper type and we might generate a "statement does not have an effect" error there.

The declaration itself is also not set at this stage.

Will merge this but also created a new issue to clean it up: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7566

Ah, this is missing a changelog entry.
