# [\#7564 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7564) `merged`: [docs] Fixes source extraction from documentation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2019-10-23 20:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7564):

### Description

The documentation contained some contracts, that we're not intended properly (2-3 whitespaces instead of 4, as needed by the extracting script) and then ignored.

This PR searches for such malformed code snippets and forces the extracting script to exit if such a snippet was found.

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7456.
