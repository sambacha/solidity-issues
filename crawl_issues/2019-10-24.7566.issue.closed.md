**Labels**: `good first issue`, `medium difficulty`

Type checker should do type checking and type checking is a local task. Its purpose is not to perform checks whether certain elements of the code are allowed at certain locations. All member variables that represent the current location in the code should be removed from the type checker and the checks that use that information should be either moved to the SyntaxChecker or to a new class that is run after the type checker (if it needs type information).
