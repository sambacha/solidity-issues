# [\#7568 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7568) `merged`: Fix failing tests on ArchLinux and potentially MacOS

fixes #7567

There is one more test that fails at Assembler.cpp:130 but I found no obvious way to fix that one yet as the output is from within jsoncpp.
The problem is again that the output on my system is lower case but the test expects upper case.

I did a very similar fix, but it seem not to work - I just defaulted to `nouppercase`. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7463/files

I also changed `libdevcore/Common.h`, `libdevcore/CommonData.h`, `libdevcore/FixedHash.h`, `libyul/AsmPrinter.cpp` and `test/tools/yulInterpreter/Interpreter.cpp` - but probably those changes are not really needed.

I used uppercase because that's what the tests originally expected.. I can't see the test results of your linked PR. How did it fail?

The one involving json is because we can't easily influence how jsoncpp outputs things, the other ones look like they should be solvable the same way we did the others, using `std::uppercase`

updated: using std:: everywhere now.
