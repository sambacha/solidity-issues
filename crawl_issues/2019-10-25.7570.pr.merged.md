## Description

This fixes #4575. For keywords such as 'super' and 'this', will be
treated as unknown identifiers.

For example, if we use `assembly { super := 1 }`, the error message will be
"Variable not found or variable not lvalue.", which is identical to the error
message of `assembly { unknown_identifier := 1 }`.
