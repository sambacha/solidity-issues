## Description

Fixes compilation failures (on `develop_060`) during external test runs on Gnosis and Colony contracts, by applying the fixed version pragma replacement after `npm install` in order to cover dependencies, and by including all directories instead of `contracts` only.

Since this change is version independent, it could be just merged into `develop`.
