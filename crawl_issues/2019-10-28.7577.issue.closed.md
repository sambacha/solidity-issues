## Description

With https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7539, we make usage of `SELFBALANCE` which will, along with `CHAINID`, be introduced by the istanbul EVM. We need to test pre-instabul VMs once evmone was updated with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7544.

## Specification

Additional test cases for the above instructions need to be added. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityExpressionCompiler.cpp#L620 for reference.
