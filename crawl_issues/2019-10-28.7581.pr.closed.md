@chriseth since this is a fuzzing related PR and we only fuzz `develop`, but the underlying fuzzed feature is available only in `0.6.0` (which is not currently fuzzed), it does not make sense to merge this PR.

If we decide to fuzz `0.6.0` as well, it makes sense to apply this PR onto `develop_060` branch

Moved to  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7607 because this PR should have been addressed to `develop_060` instead of `develop`
