## Description

The yul interpreter has no notion of gas cost because that is left to the underlying EVM implementation if I understand correctly.

However, it may be beneficial to model gas costs to flag instances where the yul optimizer increases gas consumption (one data point for consideration is #7472 )

I would not do this at the current time, since the optimizer is not taking gas costs into account at all.
Furthermore, this is really trade-off between code size and runtime cost, where it is not always clear which route to take.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
