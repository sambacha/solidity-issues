This switches the Colony repository to a fork which contains the changes needed for 0.6.0. 

I'm in contact with the people from Colony and they seem to be interested in having a separate development branch for 0.6.0. 

Here's the PR which contains mainly fixed version pragma updates and some changes needed to conform to strict inline assembly: https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork/pull/732
