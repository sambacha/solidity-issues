# [\#7611 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7611) `merged`: Yul AST cleanup (part 1)

take 2, part 1.

The second commit is necessary to work around GCC errors that seem to *only* happen on CircleCI for Ubuntu Linux. - On the other hand, I think it's better to prefer emplace() over insert/push operations where possible anyways.
