I actually think the original code was correct. If you send `2*value` to the buyer, they do not pay anything for he item after all.

I see, but why does the transaction begin with twice the sold/purchased item's `value`?

. Here's my tldr of the contract

- seller deploys contract pledging `value * 2` of their own ether
- buyer buys item by transferring `value * 2` of their ether, bringing the balance to `value * 4`
- buyer confirms purchase, thereby getting a "refund" of `value`, and the seller getting a "value * 3` i.e., actually getting `value` in revenue.

So, in the end, the buyer parted with `value` ether from their wallet, and the seller pocketed `value` as revenue which makes sense.

Why should the initial transaction cost twice the value of the item? Why not the following sequence
 - seller deploys contract without any ether
 - buyer buys item by transfering `value`
 - buyer confirms transaction and seller is transfered `value` i.e., buyer does not get any "refunds"

Ah, I found a blog post that answers my question. Ref: https://jacksonng.org/Safe-Remote-Purchase-1

TIL that's how escrow works :)
