Since this is only used for the case when someone wants to ship an incomplete library for build time (e.g. keeping code proprietary?), my opinion is to disallow it. It is easier to enable if there is a strong request for this feature, but would actually prefer to design the language better to accommodate this (perhaps using interfaces and a `using as library` statement?)

Ok, I'll disallow it.
