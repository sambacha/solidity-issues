### Description

As part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7632 I came across this line disabling SMT tests under macOS, but they mostly run for me, so I wondered why it was there. In related, I was wondering if it made sense to add a parameter to the `tests.sh` script so people can disable SMT checks at will, passing the `--no-smt` flag to `soltest.sh`?
