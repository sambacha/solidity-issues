How are stale issues and stale pull requests defined?

tl;dr we define how many days after inactivity, issue/PR becomes stale

FWIW: If the underlying script used by this github action is [this one](https://github.com/actions/stale), then we need to define the fields marked `required: true` here https://github.com/actions/stale/blob/9f69ef12ad1ae539589cc84100eacea217506838/src/main.ts#L147-L165


Edit: I'm actually not sure if all required fields should be set. `daysBeforeClose` for example, automatically closes an issue that has remained inactive for `daysBeforeClose` days. I mean, do we want that to happen?

I don't think issues should be considered stale.

The PR needs to be rebased to current develop, though (we changed the testing docker image and adjusted the tests on top of that, that's why the tests fail here now...)

Or we just ignore the tests because there is nothing to be tested.

Well, at least I can't merge (button greyed out), supposedly because of the failing tests.

Of course we changed the tests ðŸ˜†

Rebased, let's see how this fixes things.
