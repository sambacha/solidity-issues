# [\#7641 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7641) `closed`: Enum access from inline assembly.

Fixes #7622.

This works, but it's a bit hacky as it stands.

Also I think we should generally have a look into shadowing inside inline assembly - it seems a bit off for constants as well.

> Please add tests for assigning to enum value within yul.

Yep, that's currently failing an assertion, I'll add proper error messages.

Haha, also a nice case:
```
enum X { x_slot, x_offset }
```

Decision in call: we postpone this for 0.7, so I'm closing this draft.
We will take care of shadowing, though.

Is there a tracking issue for this? Should this be revived?
