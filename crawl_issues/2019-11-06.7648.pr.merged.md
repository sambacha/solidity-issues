I increased the strictness now to:

A variable name in inline assembly, or if it contains a ``.``, its prefix until the ``.``, may not conflict with any declaration visible in the current scope of the inline assembly block.

@chriseth I'd actually like to refactor all this and make ``ReferencesResolver`` inherit from a Yul AST visitor and just continue to descend into inline assembly instead of having the weird "preliminary" asm analysis pass and to maybe even make ``TypeChecker`` inherit from ``AsmAnalyzer`` and also just descend with appropriate visitor overrides there (although that'd need some more changes to the analyzer interface)... should I at least create an issue for that? I could also just go ahead and attempt to do it - at least the first part might actually be quick...

Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7656 for the refactoring.

@ekpyron please also mention this in the documentation

@axic You're right, I'll take a look and will create a follow-up PR.

In fact https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7386 was already lacking documentation updates...
