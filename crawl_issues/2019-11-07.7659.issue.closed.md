# [\#7659 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7659) `closed`: [yul] optimizer: Redundant check in expression simplifier?

## Description

I was curious why https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ed7be7b9c76c71ea1915a8f70eb42b337dc15c15/libyul/optimiser/ExpressionSimplifier.cpp#L51-L52 was never satisfied (i.e., Expression simplifier never returns early)

So, I spent some time understanding why, with the theory that perhaps some limitation of the test generator was leading to the constraint always being false.

The constraint is the following
```
  if (match->removesNonConstants && !SideEffectsCollector(m_dialect, _expression).movable())
```

which iirc means
  - the expression being visited by the expression simplifier matches a simplification rule that removes non constants (set A)
  - Side effects collector reports the same expression to be not movable (set B)

After spending some time reading optimizer code, I came to the conclusion that the intersection of sets A and B is essentially null and that is the reason for the check never being satisfied by any test generated by the fuzzer.

The way I reasoned about this is by first looking at all instructions that have a "not movable" side-effect. Most of this is documented here:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/Instruction.cpp#L179

If a "not movable" instruction contains a simplification rule pattern, we have a non-null intersection of sets A and B. In reality, there is no such instruction that is "not movable" for which we presently have a simplification rule pattern.

Did I get this right? Unless we expect to, one day, have a simplification rule for an unmovable instruction, we can do away with that if statement in the expression simplifier, since it is redundant. What do you think?

Note that the side effects collector is run on the full expression, so what we actually want to determine is if some arguments to the instructions are non-movable. Since the expression simplifier is usually run after the expression splitter, the arguments tend to be variables which are always movable. There is one exception to this: Conditions in for loops cannot be split and thus could have non-movable arguments, but nowadays, we also have the "for loop condition into body" step, which could also prevent this line from being hit.

Ah I see. I can reproduce the branch in question getting covered when ExpressionSimplifier step is run by itself. I can also reproduce the branch not getting covered when expression splitter is run before simplifier; also the case when the expression happens to be a for-loop condition and loop-condition-into-body followed by expression splitter making the branch false in expression simplifier.

Will mark this specific case as impossible to reach as the optimizer suite stands.
