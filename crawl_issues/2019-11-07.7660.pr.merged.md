Really nice, @ekpyron !

I just wanted to remark that we need to be extremely careful in making sure that stuff like this actually does what it should - and the current test failure looks extremely dangerous already - looks like some arguments were reversed somewhere without anyone noticing...

Actually, I'm wondering...
The whole rule list is actually compile time constant... if we try hard enough, we should actually be able to squeeze its entire initialization to ``constexpr`` functions and force the whole thing into a compile time static const ``std::array`` which can live in the data segment and doesn't need initialization at all (consequently getting rid of the stack height stuff once and for all)...

Adding some more output to debug the windows failure.

Now at least the error message is clear:
```
note: Element '1': no conversion from '_Ty' to '_Ty'
          with
          [
              _Ty=unsigned __int64
          ]
          and
          [
              _Ty=dev::eth::Pattern
          ]
```
...although it's weird why it would think that, given that there is a constructor... is ``unsigned __int64`` different from ``unsigned long`` on Windows?
