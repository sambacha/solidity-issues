Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7589#discussion_r344259919.
Is there a nice and easy way to have a pretty printing pass on the output? That would make those tests way easier to review.

The `commandlineTests` could `jq` the output, but not sure we want to add that dependency.

This should be very easy to do without extra dependencies now that #11583 is implemented. Just add the `--pretty-print` flag in `cmdlineTests.sh`, run it with `--update` and commit the result. I'm marking it as `good first issue`.

@matheusaaguiar let me clarify I'm moving in the right direction. There is a script `cmdlineTests.sh` that runs cmdlineTests. The script executes test with the `command_args="--standard-json "$(cat "${tdir}/args" 2>/dev/null || true)`.

The `--standard-json` arg which means I specify a test output in a json format, like here: [linking_standard_solidity/output.json](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests/linking_standard_solidity/output.json):

`{"contracts":{"A":{"C":{"evm":{"bytecode":{"linkReferences":{},"object":"<BYTECODE REMOVED>"}}}}},"sources":{"A":{"id":0}}}`

but we want to give a user opportunity to write an output in a `--pretty-json` format like that:

```
{
    "contracts":{
        "A":{
            "C":{
                "evm":{
                    "bytecode":{
                        "linkReferences":{
                            
                        },
                        "object":"<BYTECODE REMOVED>"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "sources":{
        "A":{
            "id":0
        }
    }
}
```

My questions are:
1. Am I right that it is desirable to add a cmd line arg for the whole script like `cmdlineTests.sh --pretty-json`
2. If yes how the existing test cases should be managed:
  a. if there is no `--pretty-json` in the **args** or the output is not in a json format then it should be ignored?
  b. if the output not in the prettified json format then prettify it first, and compare afterwards?

Yes, you are going in the right direction. I don't think we want to give the user the option of `pretty-print`, we actually want the json output of the relevant tests to be formatted in an easier way for humans to read. From a quick glance I think you can just add the `--pretty-print` flag to the `command_args` var and then run the script with the option `--update`. This in turn will automatically update the output of all tests and then it should be done.

Also, we then want to remove `--pretty-print` from `args` file in any test that already has it. We've been adding it only to get the formatting which will be automatic now.

Another thing, I'd recommend `--pretty-print --json-indent 4` for more readable output, matching the length we have set in our [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.editorconfig).

Finally, we actually have some command-line tests that test the `--pretty-print` functionality itself. E.g. [`pretty_json_indent_only`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests/pretty_json_indent_only). We need a way to exempt them from this. My proposal would be to detect if the test dir contains a file called `no-pretty-print` and disable automatic pretty printing if it does.

hi @matheusaaguiar @cameel before proceeding with the main subject of this issue I decided to build and run all tests including both z3 and CVC4. I founded a small suspicious place but I'm not sure whether it is a known bit. If it is I can create a PR to fix it. If not please advise.

Here we have the following:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b12b845739d7dfd540e7eef624b39052f0ab8a7d/libsmtutil/CVC4Interface.cpp#L242

but it the CVC4 [bitvector.h](https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4-archived/blob/40eac7f0529176bcc8464d6c4c8804fbde628c2b/src/util/bitvector.h) there are two constructors that make this call ambiguous:

```
  BitVector(unsigned size, uint32_t z) : d_size(size), d_value(z)
  {
    d_value = d_value.modByPow2(size);
  }

  BitVector(unsigned size, uint64_t z) : d_size(size), d_value(z)
  {
    d_value = d_value.modByPow2(size);
  }

```

I suggest to put an explicit cast for a proper call. I have already test it on my environment, works fine.

I'm not sure it really matters in this case since this seems to be used to simply represent zero. Either type should work. Does it generate a warning?

@leonardoalt Want to take a look?

@cameel it even generates an error due to an ambiguous call

Oh. Right, we definitely want to fix that. Feel free to create a PR.

I wonder why our CI does not detect this. We surely have some runs with CVC4 enabled... What platform are you on?

Thanks. I guess that's it. We don't install CVC4 on macOS. Maybe we should. What do you think @leonardoalt?

@cameel @matheusaaguiar sorry for being a nerd but why there are byte/op codes, a source map sometimes are present in tests like here:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/3ddf5db755e7ada1e26c4850764d5f7ad988333e/test/cmdlineTests/standard_yul_immutable_references/output.json#L15
but sometimes are not like here:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/3ddf5db755e7ada1e26c4850764d5f7ad988333e/test/cmdlineTests/standard_yul_object/output.json#L17

what should I do? substitute byte code (etc.) with the` <BYTECODE REMOVED>` or not?

It looks like the [regexes in `cmdlineTest.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.17/test/cmdlineTests.sh#L189-L219) are just not versatile enough to strip those from pretty-printed JSON input. We strip bytecode from output because it contains metadata, which changes between versions and would make CI fail. So you need to update these regexes.
