Were’re developing a tool to [test existing old compiler bugs in old smarts contracts where the source code and compiler version used is not known](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril/issues/1258#issuecomment-550580363).
We searched the specific issue numbers and/or commit which fixed `OptimizerClearStateOnCodePathJoin`and`OptimizerStateKnowledgeNotResetForJumpdest` but nothing was found leaving without knowing if the code works.

These two bugs are really hard to trigger, I fear I cannot provide you with example code anymore.

@chriseth : would it be possible to have at least the issue number of the specific commit which fixed them ?

This might be the issue for the first bug: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/692

Thanks, @Marenz  ! There are even examples linked in the issues!

Might still worth trying to add this into the codebase as finding specific issues proved to be hard.

@ytrezq what do you mean by "add this into the codebase" - adding in which way?

@chriseth : add it to the files detailing the compiler issue names.

Would make sense including the issue link in `bugs.json` instead?

@axic : issues themselves don’t contain the examples required to reproduce the bug most of the time.

In `bugs.json` we have links to blog posts for major issues. Perhaps it makes sense to link to the github issues where there was no blog post.

Additionally we could introduce a field for `example` which links to some file, but that can easily become a large task because then one needs to provide an example for each of the affected versions of that bug. I think we may not have enough resources to do this, but likely would be accepting such patches!
