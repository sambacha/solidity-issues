Since all the changes in solc-js are actually being merged to `master` and using version guards when applicable, we can go back to using `master` directly.

Actually I want to make some PRs to `master_060`, such as removing the backwards compatibility `compileStandard*` exports as well as requiring a callback object. That means testing against that makes sense.
