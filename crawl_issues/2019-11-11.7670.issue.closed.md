Thesis: http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/61297/1/tesi_Di_Pirro.pdf
Article: https://fc19.ifca.ai/wtsc/SoliditySolid.pdf

The thesis might be more valuable for us than the article - the article seems to be about a different language that is similar to Solidity.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
