cleanup Parser::instructions() / Parser::instructionNames() (move to EVMDialect instead).

This was done.

@chriseth I think you refer to `libyul/optimiser/SimplifcationRules.cpp` and `Pattern::toExpression` in particular. Why is this a problem btw?

It looks weird. The Builtins-semi-type should just contain the function names directly.

Besides that almost every single use in the compiler does a first conversion to lower, can't we just keep it in lowercase and uppercase it for the single case (assembly output) needing it?

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
