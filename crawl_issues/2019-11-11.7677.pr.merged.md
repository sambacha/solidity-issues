# [\#7677 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7677) `merged`: Remove overwritten tag in CI config.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-11-11 13:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7677):

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7464

If I see this correctly, the tag I now removed was unused and the label it created was overwritten, so cleaner to just remove it - let's see if I was right. Expected result: the ubuntu CI test runs should have run ``soltest_all.sh`` before this PR and should still do it after this PR.
