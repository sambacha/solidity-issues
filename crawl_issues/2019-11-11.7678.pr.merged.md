# [\#7678 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7678) `merged`: Update PPA build scripts.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-11-11 13:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7678):

Adds ubuntu "eoan" (19.10) to PPA scripts and updates Z3 to 4.8.6.

This can be pulled out of draft mode once the Z3 builds (https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps/+packages) have finished successfully.

We might also want to trigger a prerelease PPA build to check the new eoan build, but I don't expect any issues with that.

Should we update the clang built docker image as well? Essentially here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2f9779d06bf933c098d9c4979c1072179857974b/.circleci/docker/Dockerfile.clang.ubuntu1904#L65

Builds succeeded: next steps: merging this and update docker image - then update test expectations and osx build in a new PR.
