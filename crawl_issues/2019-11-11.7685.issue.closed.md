In order to not need manually build and wait and push the docker images whenever we want them to be updated, we need to enable auto-build feature of DockerHub for the docker files by also configuring specific build rules.

Can we achieve that by keeping the Dockerfiles in the main "develop" branch without producing excess to the DockerHub build pipeline?

- that's basically a little bit of a revive of #3917.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
