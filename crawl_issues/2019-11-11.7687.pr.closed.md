# [\#7687 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7687) `closed`: Upgrade evmone to 0.2.0 and remove manual install of ethash/intx in the docker image

I'm still wondering why were the ethash/intx downloads needed? Didn't evmone 0.1.0 properly download them?

So you're saying they are part of the evmone submodules?

They are downloaded by cmake via hunter.

iirc, the evmone build system uses a cmake plugin called hunter which makes it difficult to control build flags passed to deps (such as ethash and intx). At the time I wrote these lines for the docker image, I couldn't find a way to cleanly install evmone and all its deps via a single cmake command so I decided to do it manually as it is done.

@chfast I remember we had a discussion on gitter about this. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Isn't it all statically linked so that none of the deps need to be installed?

iirc, at least for 0.1.0 this is not the case. That might explain why I had to link the deps manually here

Tested this PR locally: I can confirm that neither `intx` nor `ethhash` is installed by evmone's cmake invocation (in the prefix location e.g., `/usr`) if the evmone shared library is built. Here we need to stick to the shared library build because `soltest` requires it.

What we need imo is something like this (see https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/issues/274) so that deps built by hunter are also installed in `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

This targets develop, so it should be fine even before #7694 :-).

By the way: does stock ubuntu clang really not work against stock ubuntu boost and we *have* to build it from source here?

Closing this PR because #7700 supersedes it
