Can be closed once all tests pass.

Ok - note that all tests pass for ``develop``. I'm rebasing this to ``develop_060`` now to confirm the remaining failure there.

Ok, the PR confirmed the one test failure on develop_060.
I'm updating the expectations on it to check whether that works reliably (but in the end @leonardoalt needs to decide how to deal with this)

I already deleted the problematic test and updated the other two in the other PR, so I'd say everything should be working for now

@leonardoalt Which other PR?

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7682 only fixed it for ``develop``, but actually breaks it for ``develop_060``... or have I missed a different one?

Currently ``develop`` is working and was merged to ``develop_060``, but the tests behave differently on ``develop_060`` and are consequently still broken right now (see e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7647 which is aleady rebased on top of all that)

Why does it break for `develop_060`? I assumed it would work there after merging `develop -> develop_060`.

I thought the same, but on ``develop_060`` the false positive added in the other PR vanishes again apparently :-).

What...

It's another one of the cases, where the AST IDs affect the result as well... the test in question behaves differently with and without pragma on develop_060...

Closing - decision: we remove these tests.
