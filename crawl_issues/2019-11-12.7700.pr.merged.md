Please don't forget to version the dockerfiles: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7689#issuecomment-552983946

Please let me know if the naming/versioning scheme is fine. Previously, the images were all named as `solidity-build-deps` and tagged as `<distro>[-<compiler>]`

Now they are named as `solidity-build-deps-<distro>[-<compiler>]` and versioned as 1,2,3 etc.

It looks good to me.

Hmm... I cannot push the updated images because the repo name changed from `solidity-build-deps` to `solidity-build-deps-<distro>` and the latter does not exist. I don't have permission to create a repo in the ethereum namespace on docker hub

@bshastry Should those be part of the repo names at all? Or should the "revision" rather be part of the "version", i.e. ``solidity-build-deps:ubuntu1904-1``, ``solidity-build-deps:ubuntu1904-2``, etc.?
I'm not sure how the ``LABEL`` thing interacts with that, though... (I asked @christianparpart to look into it...)

I considered this, but the problem is we need to somehow know which version to tag while manually building the docker image. Perhaps, we can mention the last version number in the README and expect the image builder to use `version number` + 1 for the next build. somehow this felt a bit hacky to me and prone to error. But may be I'm missing something.

Yeah, I had the same thought. Haven't been able to test it yet because I cannot do it locally.

@bshastry Why did you use the `LABEL=` lines? So what was your intend?

IIRC, Docker labels are simple key/value metadata maps, that can be used for introspection. I did not find a way to pull a docker image based on a label.

The problem with your above approach so far is, that it requires more docker images to co-exist on DockerHub, because you moved the topic (e.g. `ubuntu1904`) from the tag-part (right-hand-side of the `:` colon) to the left-hand-side, into the docker image's name, which must exist as a docker image repository on Dockerhub.

See: https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/solidity-buildpack-deps/tags for reference.

Our proposal is to keep the topic name as tag, but also append the version number, if necessary, so that the full name would become (for example):

    ethereum/solidity-buildpack-deps:ubuntu1904-1

Essentially, I blindly followed @axic suggestion mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7689#issuecomment-552983946

> Our proposal is to keep the topic name as tag, but also append the version number, if necessary, so that the full name would become (for example):

I'm fine with this approach. My only concern with this is that the image updater (human) needs to ensure that an update bumps up the version number by one. I guess this is not a big deal since we need to manually tag the image for separate distros anyway.

Another question: Since we keep adding more and more images (newer versions), won't we run out of space on docker hub at some point. How do we clean up old versions that are no longer needed? Perhaps we only need to keep at most X previous versions as back up
