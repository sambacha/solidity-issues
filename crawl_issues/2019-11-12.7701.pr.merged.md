Fixes #7274.

It might use some more test.

Yeah, needs to be disabled for EVM versions without ~~``delegatecall``~~ ~~whatever-is-missing-for-homestead-there~~ returndata support, that's it... in fact I think I'll also add another one using ``call`` on a view function...

Maybe this should actually be extended to allow grabbing the signature/selector of library functions using member accesses like for other external functions... but that'd be breaking in any case, so *if* we want that, we need to do it separately and target 0.6.0...

@ekpyron the extension sounds good to me. Why is it breaking?

Hm... I thought because of ``using`` with libraries, but that actually doesn't apply here - maybe it actually wouldn't be breaking after all...
[labelling "to discuss" to quickly decide if and when we want to have the extension]
