The `abi*.sol` tests added here used to ICE due to their return type not being handled correctly.
This PR then adds support to function calls where the function definition is not present. The returned values are fresh variables and therefore the precise value abstracted. For external calls this leads to *all* variables in the scope being reset.

@ekpyron Removed `setComponents` and symbolically assigned each component instead, as suggested
