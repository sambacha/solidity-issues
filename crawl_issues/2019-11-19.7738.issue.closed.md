# [\#7738 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7738) `closed`: Add pragma about open or closed source / license

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2019-11-19 11:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7738):

In the effort to increase the link between a contract's address and its ABI / source code, one stepping stone is encouraging developers to publish their source code. Some of the tool writers we have spoken to are reluctant to auto-publish the source code at the point of deployment because the tools are also used for closed-source contracts, on private chains and with testnets.

Furthermore, an interactive deployment process where users have to answer a "publish or not publish" questions is also not an option because he deployment is usually performed by Ci/CD servers.

This leaves us with the option that contract developers have to state their decision before the code is published. One way of enforcing this decision is to add a pragma to the Solidity language that is required and specifies whether or not the source code can be published. We can go so far and even allow users to specify a license, which could be a good measure anyway.

Proposal:

A `pragma license "<license>";` line is required in each source file. The compiler parses the value as a generic string. The only interpretation performed on that string is to check whether it is the string `closed` or `none`, which means that the source code is not to be published.

Example:

```
pragma license "closed";
```

```
pragma license "CC BY-SA 2.0";
```

From call: instead of making it mandatory, how about only issuing a warning if not there?

Usually every source code file (regardless of language) has a header file stating copyright, licence, and author.

When I think of this in a more generic way, I'd propose to support:
* zero or more licenses (with: no licence equals an empty string, equals "closed")
* zero or more authors

I'd propose author list (as part of the AST) here for future aggregation by (statistical) tools.

On the other hand, if we force users to add a license to each file, it forces them to think about their license they want to put this code under, which is something I'd personally prefer.

One goal of this is that the license is machine-readable. Is there any standard for names of common software licenses?

The standard is SPDX: https://spdx.org/licenses/. It also has an expression syntax.

This is the one used by NPM (https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#license) and Cargo (https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-license-and-license-file-fields) to name a few.

Tentative "accept" in discussion call, leaning towards "warning", especially since an error would make it hard to write small examples.

Open questions:
 - is there a specific "closed source" license?
 - what about custom licenses?

We can check what cargo does about that.

"Proprietary"
