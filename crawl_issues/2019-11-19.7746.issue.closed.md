# [\#7746 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7746) `closed`: [Documentation] Clarify scope extension rule for variables in for-init block
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-11-19 14:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7746):

[yul scoping rules](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.13/yul.html#scoping-rules) are documented as follows:

> Identifiers are visible in the block they are defined in (including all sub-nodes and sub-blocks). As an exception, identifiers defined in the “init” part of the for-loop (the first block) are visible in all other parts of the for-loop (but not outside of the loop)

Could we clarify that identifiers defined in the "init" part of the for-loop (the first block) only includes those in the same nesting level (or something to that effect) as the for-init block, and more importantly does not include identifiers defined inside nested blocks within the for-init block?

For example, in a vague sense, the identifier `x_0` is in the "init" part of the for loop, but not visible in other parts of the for loop because it is inside a nested block of the for-init block.

```
Error: Identifier not found.
  for {{let x_0 := 0x100}} x_0 {} {}
                           ^-^
```
