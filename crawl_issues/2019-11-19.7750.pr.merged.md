Fixes #7736

~~This is WIP as I try to find a fix for #7736 without resorting to pipeline parameters that will force us to upgrade to circle ci configuration version 2.1~~

I updated this PR to use pipeline parameters instead of a yaml anchor. Since this PR involves upgrading circle ci config version to `2.1` from `2` (in order to make use of pipeline parameters), I will wait on the CIs before marking this for review.
