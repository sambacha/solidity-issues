# [\#7761 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7761) `closed`: [Documentation] Clarify function definition inside for-init block
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-11-20 15:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7761):

With regard to the subject of this issue, the yul documentation states that

> Functions cannot be defined inside for loop init blocks.

Later on, with reference to variable definition, the documentation states that

> identifiers defined in the “init” part of the for-loop (the first block)

The latter has now been clarified to mean directly in the "init" part of the for-loop (see #7747 ) which leaves the scope of function definition inside for loop init blocks open to interpretation (since inside the for loop init block may either mean directly inside or anywhere inside). This issue tracks support for this clarification in the yul docu.
