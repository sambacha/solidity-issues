This PR adds a successful compilation of external projects (currently 3) to the list of checks in Circle.

It's mainly meant to target 0.6.0, since there it will force us to update ext. contracts as part of (breaking) feature development again.

All ext. tests are still fully run on a nightly basis. Only those nightly runs do report to Gitter.

Since we decided to not run the tests, but only compile external projects, these have now been removed from the nightly CircleCI runs. The CircleCI workflows and our scripts stay untouched fro now, such that we can them re-enable easily if needed.
