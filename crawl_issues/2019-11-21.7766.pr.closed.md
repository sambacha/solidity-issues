@rodiazet can you use rebase please and not merge commits?

@rodiazet I've created a bunch of basic tests in #7942.

Perhaps the best procedure to merge this PR is by:
1. merging #7942
2. adding some very basic tests for arithmetic, bitwise and comparison ops (see #7956)
3. rebasing this PR and checking what was implemented/broken

I did rebase this on #7942 and some things improved, but others broke.

Can you please rebase, since the basic tests were merged?

@axic  I can split polyfil string into two smaller. One with functions available for user and second with all the helper functions. Helper functions can be moved to separated file. It will fix VS build and make the string more readable. Should I do that?

@rodiazet I think you could create two PRs at least:
- one for the interpreter improvements
- one for the getter implementations (coinbase, origin, etc.) as those are simple enough and should pass already

Then we have basically the arithmetic heavy hitters left here to finish.

@rodiazet were all these changes split into a new PRs?
