## Abstract

Currently, a function call is specified by the number of output values it generates
  - none
  - single
  - multidecl
  - multiassign

This is non-intuitive and may be refactored.

## Motivation

Specialize the function call message as follows:

- `message FunctionCallNoReturn`
  - Encodes a function call with up to 4 input arguments

- `message FunctionCallSingleReturn`
  - Encodes a function call with up to 4 input arguments and exactly one output value

- `message FunctionCallMultiReturn`
  - Encodes a function call with up to 4 inputs/outputs

- `message MultiAssignment`
  - Encodes assignment of between 2-4 return values of a `FunctionCallMultiReturn` to previously defined variables

- `message MultiDecl`
  - Encodes assignment of between 2-4 return values of a `FunctionCallMultiReturn` to newly defined variables

- `FunctionCallSingleReturn` is an expression type

- `FunctionCallNoReturn`, `MultiDecl`, and `MultiAssignment` are all statement types

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
