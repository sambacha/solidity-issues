# [\#7783 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7783) `closed`: [Yul] output source locations

The AssemblyStack does not support source locations (or source mappings) even though almost all other parts of the infrastructure do. The goal of this task would be to have source mappings as defined in standard-json also if the input language is yul.

CompilerStack has a setting to either run in "Yul" mode (taking Yul code as input) or in (regular) "Solidity" mode. Both modes have their own "compile" functions, but use roughly the same input structure and produce roughly the same output structure. What is missing from the Yul mode is the source references.

The Solidity mode has code
```
			evmData["bytecode"] = collectEVMObject(
				compilerStack.object(contractName),
				compilerStack.sourceMapping(contractName)
			);
```

while in Yul mode, the source mappings are not passed to that function. This means that `CompilerStack::sourceMapping` needs to be modified to also work in Yul mode.

For this, in turn, it is required to export the AssemblyItems from AssemblyStack (but only in EVM mode, not in EVM15 or ewasm mode).

Taking into sprint2.
