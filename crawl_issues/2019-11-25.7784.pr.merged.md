Update:

- Gnosis and Colony work now.
- Zeppelin is failing because of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5424#issuecomment-530787767. The reason is, that they have an inheritance structure which would need either a solution such as the one mentioned by @ekpyron in #5424 or allowing calldata parameters in public functions and a subtle change to their contracts.
So the the structure is basically this:
```
interface IRelayRecipient {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external;
}
abstract contract GSNRecipient is IRelayRecipient {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external { ... }
}
abstract contract GSNRecipientSignature is GSNRecipient {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external {...}
}
contract GSNRecipientSignatureMock is GSNRecipient, GSNRecipientSignature {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external override(IRelayRecipient, GSNRecipientSignature) {
        /* wants to call GSNRecipient.acceptRelayedCall(), but can't */
    }
}
```

I'd be in favour merging this even without zeppelin worked. Still better than without.

@axic Please feel free to merge :-) I think @ekpyron starting working on the solution mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5424#issuecomment-530787767. I had the impression that it might be beneficial to keep this open, since it's currently the only test that triggers this behaviour. But since it's a prominent issue already, we could also just merge and fix Zeppelin later.

Well, I started looking into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5424#issuecomment-530787767, but I don't think I can finish that in time for a soonish 0.6 release. Let's discuss that part on Monday - but I agree that we can go ahead and merge this as is for now.

Actually the structure is:
```
abstract contract IRelayRecipient {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external;
}
abstract contract GSNRecipient is IRelayRecipient {
}
abstract contract GSNRecipientSignature is GSNRecipient {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external override {...}
}
contract GSNRecipientSignatureMock is GSNRecipient, GSNRecipientSignature {
    function acceptRelayedCall() external override(IRelayRecipient, GSNRecipientSignature) {
        /* wants to call GSNRecipient.acceptRelayedCall(), but can't */
    }
}
```

Which is interesting in two ways:
1. This should actually work and be exactly the same if ``GSNRecipientSignatureMock`` inherited only from ``GSNRecipientSignature``, but not needlessly again from ``GSNRecipient`` (which is a base of ``GSNRecipientSignature`` anyways...
2. We could consider this a bug in our override logic - we could redefine ``override`` to only require to explicitly mention every contract in which there is a base function *implementation*, but not if the base contract only contains it without implementation... If there is no implementation in any base class, we'd still need to require a plain ``override`` though.

I just rebased this to retrigger the tests - they should all go through now.
