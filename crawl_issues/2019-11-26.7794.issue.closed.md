**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

We only have implicit tests for `FixedHash`, the closest is `test/libdevcore/Keccak256`.

Before adding tests it would make sense figuring out which features of `FixedHash` are needed, because it seems a lot of them wouldn't be used in Solidity.

From #10448:
> I have various branches removing features from FixedHash, tried to merge them here, but I think it will be easier to progress if we argue about them in separate PRs. Examples:
> 
> remove support for FixedHash<0>
> removing the bytesConstRef constructor
> removing indexing operator (and changing the ostream to use hex() simply) -- if we keep it, it should do a runtime error on out of bounds
> change what happens when input is too short / too large (currently it just sets the hash to zeroes)

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
