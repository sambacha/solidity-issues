The only change in `test/libsolidity/gasTests/abiv2_optimised.sol` is that in the new logic, a variable is introduced for `add(_1, _2)`, while the expression is inlined (but only used once) in the old logic.

The interesting fact is that this happens fully inside the loop body. So maybe the better condition would be: Remat everything if it is used only once unless the definition of the variable is at a different loop depth than the reference.

Tests are failing. Perhaps a rebase issue?
