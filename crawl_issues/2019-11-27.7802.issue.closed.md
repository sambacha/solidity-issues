# [\#7802 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7802) `closed`: Consider removing the unique_ptr in EVMHost

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2019-11-27 10:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7802):

@chfast mentioned that `evmc::VM` is a unique_ptr itself so wrapping it into one should not be needed here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/EVMHost.cpp#L38

However we still need to be able to tell if it contains null:
```
	/// Tries to dynamically load libevmone. @returns nullptr on failure.
	/// The path has to be provided for the first successful run and will be ignored
	/// afterwards.
	static evmc::VM* getVM(std::string const& _path = {});
```
