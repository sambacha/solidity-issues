Instead of keeping global static singleton that has to be reset during compilations (considering you compile more than once within the same process, for example in the LSP), it is cleaner to not rely on a global context but to pass it (which we do in many cases already anyway).

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
