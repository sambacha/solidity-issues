Boost.Test is a huge dependency, and [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) is a "thin" header-only replacement that should support of of what we are currently using from Boost.Test.

``DYNAMIC_SESSION`` can probably be used for "injecting" the extracted test cases.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
