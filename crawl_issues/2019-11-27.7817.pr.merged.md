# [\#7817 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7817) `merged`: Report error on shadowing state variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-11-27 16:31](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7817):

## Goal:

* [x] State variables shadowing state variables from base contracts must raise an error (Closes #2563.)
* [x] new test added.
* [x] existing tests adapted.
* [x] ChangeLog added
* [x] documentation adapted
* [x] Entry to "0.6.0" change list

## Notes

I still feel it kind of conflicts with the work with @Marenz. So maybe you can have a look too (that's why some tests (of yours) are failing).

Maybe we should clarify here a bit. I see perfect reasoning in the way shadowed variables are reported (in this PR), and I *thought* that the variable override logic were about to override a base function with a state var in the child contract, but apparently some tests fail with some interesting new syntax that I don't understand yet.

Please add changelog entry, documentation and entry to "0.6.0" change list"

I just found this https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/NameAndTypeResolver.cpp#L349
this would probably then be a better place to do this no?

Rebased, updated docs, tests and comments

Do we have a test that shows a clash between a variable and a function?
