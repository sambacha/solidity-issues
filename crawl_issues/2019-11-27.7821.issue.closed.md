Relates to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7799

Currently, LoopInvariantCodeMotion only deals with assignments to SSA variables from expressions only containing SSA variables and movable function calls.

We should extend it to any statement that
 - only contains movable code
 - only assigns to variables that are defined inside that statement (if it is a complex block)
 - if variables defined outside that statement are referenced, the have to be ssa variables defined outside the for loop.

In light of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7867 this can also be extended to turn
```
for {} c { P... } { B... }
```
into
```
if c {
  movedCode
  for {} c { P'... } { B'... }
}
```
if part of the moved code is not always guaranteed to return (like it contains a potentially infinite loop).

Hi, did anybody work on this improvement? Is this still valid?
If so, I'd like to work on this as a contribution to Solidity's open source code (i.e. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13058)
Could somebody give me more context on this? Or any additional starting point other than the issue description? If not, I might be able to work with only what's in the comments above.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
