# [\#7827 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7827) `merged`: Update to jsoncpp 1.9.2

Attempt to solve #5869, but couldn't find any reproducible test case with any compiler version. Any ideas @bshastry? The test case in the fuzzer issue is not reproducing it.

I could reproduce the test failure with clang-6, UBSan enabled, jsoncpp v1.8.4, latest solidity develop commit but not with this PR.

Hm, so no way to add a test case into our repo which would reproduce this without ubsan?

Sadly, yes. Unless we add a UBSan build and test CIs. I feel adding a UBSan may be an overkill for this though because as far as I remember this is the only bug that was found (in a dependency and not solidity) by UBSan.

Is it with the test case from the issue? I can't fathom how that could lead into this. Is it due to some gas estimation field?
