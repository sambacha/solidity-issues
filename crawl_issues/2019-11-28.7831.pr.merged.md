# [\#7831 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7831) `merged`: Use evmc::MockedHost moar

This reuses some data structs and features already defined in `evmc::MockedHost` in `EVMHost` implementation. It is up to discussion if this should be continued and if the direction is right in general.

Depends on #7848.

If these things are part of EVMC anyway, then we should use them!

Some older clang fails on this: https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity/jobs/618167425

Rebased on develop and fixed my original commit message. Before merging, we should update to EVMC master which:
- drops the second commit ("add nonce")
- and introduces const specifiers on some of the host

@chfast @chriseth @ekpyron this is ready for a round of review and hopefully merging

Note: easier to review commit-by-commit

Compared to #7854, which ran `release_soltest` as 12m10s, this PR (together with the other EVMC changes) reduces time to 11m20s.

It is a 7% time reduction.
