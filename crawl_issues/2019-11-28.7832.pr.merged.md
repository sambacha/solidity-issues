Ok - the boost-related build failure I had locally apparently doesn't reproduce on CI, so it's only the solc-js change causing problems here... I'll try building to WASM to see what happens...

This seems to reduce binary size:
- last build on develop (4 hrs ago): 14346146 Nov 28 11:08 soljson.js
- this build: 12295262 Nov 28 17:13 soljson.js

Marked it as 0.5.14, because it would be nice to get it in.

@axic not sure about the Travis test failure.

The docker image for travis wasn't updated.

Yeah, first I didn't care about travis, because it's somewhat in limbo anyways, and then I forgot about it, I'll look into it!

(In case @axic's change didn't already fix it)

CI was almost finished. And it restarts with reopening. Just saying.
