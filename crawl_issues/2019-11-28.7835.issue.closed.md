# [\#7835 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7835) `closed`: Generate proper parser errors for NatSpec documentation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2019-11-28 13:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7835):

## Abstract

With https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7534, we introduced a (partially) breaking change: the developer documentation of a function must contain a `@return` tag for every named return parameter and define the parameter name as the first word after the tag. Compiling without `--devdoc` is still fine, but requesting it, leads to an Internal Compiler Error.

We should generate proper parser errors in the analyzation phase of a NatSpec string.

This will require some changes to the AST, since documentation needs to become an ASTNode such that it can provide source locations and, in a subsequent step, even every tag as an individual ASTNode which we can pinpoint to in case of an error.

## Motivation

Consider the following contract in a file called `Test.sol`
```
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

abstract contract C {
    /// @dev Some nice documentation
    /// @return A value
    function test() public returns (uint value);
}
```
Compiling it with `solc Test.sol` will succeed. Requesting the developer documentation using `solc --devdoc` will result in an Internal Compiler Error because `/// @return A value` does not contain the name of the return parameter as the first word after the tag.

Also, our source upgrade tool (`solidity-upgrade`), that is currently in development, will profit from source locations, because it would be also able to upgrade documentation then.

## Specification

- [x] A minimal solution for the 0.6.0 release could be the generation of a `DocStringError` without source location. That would at least make the change a consistently breaking one  --> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7837

- [x] The next step could be the introduction of a `DocString` node to the AST, and the `Documented` class having a pointer to it (instead of `ASTString`) --> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7834

- [ ] After the AST node was introduced, report source locations at least for every single or multiline comment, spanning over the whole documentation string -> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8221

- [ ] In order to report errors and their source location correctly, an additional AST node for every tag is needed.

I see a PR from you @erak so it seems you're working on this. Assigning you

I think we need to discuss the last point: "In order to report errors and their source location correctly, an additional AST node for every tag is needed."

I did some hacking on that and realized a few things that might need more work than initially thought:
- The `DocStringParser` would need to create nodes, but doesn't have the full documentation string.
Comment literals `///`, `/* */` etc. are filtered by the scanner before and thus the `DocStringParser` cannot properly compute the offset from the actual tag to the beginning of the documentation string.
-  The above would probably require proper tokenization of documentation strings in order to report the correct, "inner" source location of tags.
- Both would need a solution which needs a good chunk of code to be rewritten (enhance scanner and parser and throw away `DocStringParser`)

So I would propose to post-pone the last step and at least report the location of the full documentation string in which the error occured. This will be done with: #8221.

Does anyone have further thoughts or opinions?

You are right, this sounds rather difficult with the current architecture.
