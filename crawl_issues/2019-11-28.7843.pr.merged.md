Closes #2090
Depends on #7832

Should build soljson.js and soljson.wasm for synchronous loading.

External tests of course fail, because we'd need to copy ``soljson.wasm`` around for them.

I'd say before we go ahead with this at all we should test the wasm version in remix.

@ekpyron I think we should actually postpone this after 0.6.0 and leave enough time to experiment/figure this one out

We made great progress and know this is possible at least.

Yep, I agree - this is mainly opened as PR to have CI build it and not with the intention to merge it anytime soon :-).

@axic You want to see something funny :-)? Then look at the last commit - if we in fact base64 encode the wasm file and prepend it to the auxiliary ``soljson.js`` with some decoding logic, we end up with a 7MB drop in replacement for regular ``soljson.js``, which can be loaded into remix-alpha.

I just played around with it a bit... it seems to work perfectly and seems magnitudes faster on (artificially) larger contracts...
The integrated loading logic is not very good, though, apparently... it tries to deduce an URL for ``soljson.wasm``, but doesn't manage (if I add logging to it it still tries to load plain ``soljson.wasm``, which raises an "Invalid URL" error).
Manually providing ``Module["locateFile"]`` would probably work as well, though, but I haven't properly tested it so far.

Yeah, apparently when loaded from a remix worker soljson.js will end up getting a "scriptDirectory" of ``blob:http://remix-alpha.ethereum.org/<SOME-UUID>`` only and can't deduce the location of soljson.wasm based on that... but manually providing ``Module["locateFile"]`` for it should indeed work.

Also: it required quite a bit of tinkering, but I managed to build a drop-in replacement for 0.4.25's soljson.js (containing base64 encoded wasm) and checked in remix that it indeed loads and works as expected and doesn't exhibit the stack height problem.
It'll be quite some work to do this cleanly and in a well-documented way, but I think this will make for a nice solution for the browser problems.

Cool idea! I was worried the base64 encoding would increase it a lot and/or slow down loading too much (due to decoding).

How about [ascii85 / encoding85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85)? That uses more symbols (e.g. more compact), but has still a "JSON compatible" character set, e.g. no escaping needed in Javascript (the RFC-1924 version, specifically).

Also @ekpyron I think this feature of merging wasm into it could be an upstream patch, at somem point.

I thought about it and we can try, but I don't think ascii85 is worth it - in fact we might do the opposite and also try hex - I think simple and fast conversion might be more important than data density - the whole thing is likely to be zipped for https resp. http/2 transfer anyways (so we should also check what's most compact when compressed, not only uncompressed).

Given the stack height problems in the asm.js version and the vastly increased compilatiion speed, plus still smaller file size than asm.js, plus pretty ubiquitous wasm support in browsers these days, maybe even rather soon...

Good point. I was concerned about binary sizes given we put so many into `solc-bin` (which btw was over a 1 GB a year ago, probably over 2 GB now), but perhaps I shouldn't be and be more worried on loading speed.

I'm surprised that github hasn't complained about that repo yet :-)... We should in fact consider building them in github actions and publishing them in github packages in the solidity repo instead - that would also remove the need for travis (or anyone) having push permissions anywhere... but that's a whole different thing, independent of the wasm build itself - I don't think where and how it's going to be hosted should be the prime concern when building it.

So actually it seems the asm.js is well compressible so the entire repo in git packs is only 400 Mb.

However unpacked it is 7.6 Gb.

At least for zip-compressing an individual release I get the following:

I just rebased and switched this to only building one soljson.js with base64-encoded wasm embedded in it - let's see if it still passes all tests.

If that works, the following remains to be done:
- changelog entry and documentation of the change and the new requirement for running soljson.js
- verify the travis build, etc., works (I think that's not all done yet)
- consider using uglifyjs to minify the base64 decoding code and to automatically remove the redundant loading logic from soljson.js (as @axic suggested)
- make sure the license for the base64 decoding code is fine, or replace, or switch to hex after all

I just checked: ``uglifyjs`` won't help and the way the loading code is embedded in the js part makes it a bit tricky to remove it... I'm checking if there is an option for emscripten to not even generate it, but it doesn't look like it - so in the end I think it's easiest to just ignore those few lines of dead code.

Haha, ok, the PR just shrunk to a fraction of its size and should still work - in fact emscripten had an option ``SINGLE_FILE=1`` that does the whole base64-encoded embedding for us. I remembered something like that last time, but hadn't found it for some reason - but yeah, no need to do any of it manually on our end.
