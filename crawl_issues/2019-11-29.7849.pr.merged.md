@ekpyron even with so many tests in the SMT constructors PR we missed this case that was actually broken ;)

The second part of the `if` looks similar to the `else`, but I don't think it's worth it to get it out because of `unique_ptr` etc.

No Changelog entry because the broken code hasn't been released yet
