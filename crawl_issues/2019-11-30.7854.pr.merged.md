> Why the clang one in particular? We could enable it everywhere for the time being, if we remove it again soonish anyways - and as long as we keep it we should probably test it on all platforms to be safe...

I don't mind. Can turn on by default, it shouldn't matter too much speed wise.

@ekpyron do you want to take this over given you know the circleci config better?

Labelling this as "to discuss" for Monday to decide for which CI runs to enable it - once decided I can take it over and do it, sure!

Agreed on today's meeting to just enabled it for all soltest runs.

@ekpyron also make sure to rebase this as the actual fix was merged by #7853.

@ekpyron need to disable for the asan task given it leaks memory (it is a known issue, see #2932)

@axic Ah, right - I was curious to see, if it finds errors, but didn't know that it's a known issue - I'm disabling.

Note that the LLL tests occur in the XML artifacts of the CI runs, so they are in fact run as intended.

@ekpyron Confirmed in `t_osx_soltest` and `t_ubu_soltest`, but not in `t_ubu_release_soltest`.

Weird.. I admit I didn't check that one - apparently it doesn't import the environment variable from the normal build - I'm enabling it explicitly for that one as well - this time it should be there.

Now I see it in the ``t_ubu_release_soltest`` artifact as well.
