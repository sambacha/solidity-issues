This is the first step into what I think will become a series of override/virtual cleanup PRs...
I tried to make a lot of the test-cases non-abstract where appropriate (although not all of them for which it was possible).
Someone should have a careful look to check, if I got the intention of all tests right.

No changelog needed, it is part of the virtual/override feature.
I will take over and merge.

Updated docs. solcjs tests still need fixing.
