# [\#7871 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7871) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix ICE in array of structs type

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2019-12-02 23:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7871):

Found via and fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7466

The problem was that `s` was correctly seen as an identifier, but it is not a variable.
If the expression type is `TypeType` we might as well exit earlier than any processing, since nothing happens anyway and it already has a symbolic expression from `createExpr`.

The newly added test used to ICE.
