Please add a test:
```
A { f }
B is A { f }
C is A, B {} // might have to use C is B, A - whatever works with C3
```

Will rebase.

Rebased and added the mentioned test - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7878#issuecomment-562046964 - is that what we want or not?

Latest spec:
Always override with the following exception:
You don't have to override, whenever there is a base, that is part of all override paths for the signature, and (1) that base implements the function and no paths from the base to the current contract mentions a function with that signature or (2) that base doesn't implement the function and there is at most one mention of the function in all paths from that base to the current contract and that mention (if available) implements it.

Define override path as a path through the inheritance graph that starts at the contract currently being considered, ends at a contract mentioning the function signature being considered and is not the prefix of another override path.

Or equivalently as a path through the inheritance graph that ends at a contract with a function of that signature that doesn't override any other function.

@chriseth @ekpyron So the current spec also considers that functions without implementation must be overriden?

It's fine not to have an implementation - that just forces your contract to be ``abstract``.
