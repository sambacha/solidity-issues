That's what triggered the builds currently running at https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps/+packages

Are the PPA fails correct or old?

Which ones do you mean? The "8" failures are old - the current build is still running.
EDIT: Now it's 10, but that was still old ones :-).

There are 10 failures now though

Yep, still old ones... I pushed three versions or so in the last hour and only the last one is expected to actually go through...

Builds are at ~80%

Note, by the way, that the PPA version isn't ``4.8.7``, but ``4.8.7-1``, since I had change it for launchpad to accept the patched sources - that might affect how we need to update the docker files.

Ah damn - they re-named their cmake options... I need to trigger new builds...

Ok... triggered yet another build - see the changes in the second commit.

@ekpyron Can we merge this and have someone update the docker image?

Maybe I'll update the docker files here?

Yea makes sense

Hm... maybe makes even more sense in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7872, in which we can actually test the docker files...
