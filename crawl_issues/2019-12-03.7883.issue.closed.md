## Abstract

Since writing protobuf programs that generate specific yul test cases by hand is quite a pain, it would be nice to have a tool that accepts a valid yul program as input and translates it to a protobuf message, potentially printing it to an output file.

## Motivation

- main.cpp
  - yul parser parses input into an AST
  - write AST visitor that does the protobuf conversion

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
