# [\#7893 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7893) `merged`: yul proto fuzzer: Target upcoming evm version

Targets berlin

~~Now that #7890 has been merged, the work around to fuzz istanbul done in #7730 is no longer needed.~~

~~This PR reverts to making the differential proto fuzzer target the default evm version (which is istanbul on upstream develop)~~

Is it worth keeping the fuzzer running at constantinople till the 7th when istanbul goes live?

Since #7730 was merged (a little over 2 weeks ago), we've only been fuzzing Istanbul but of course, we can change that.

However, do we want to? I was of the impression that the main goal at the moment is to find potential bugs in the istanbul target prior to release.

Its fine then, lets merge this.

Actually, why not just keep it at istanbul explicitly?

Since istanbul is the default evm version since #7890 got merged earlier today, we can simply rely on the default evm version object being istanbul.

I understand that, but at the next hard fork we'll keep changing these back and forth again. Don't see much benefit matching this to "default" when it has a specific purpose :)

Okay, I guess your suggestion is to keep it explicitly to the latest hard fork and update it from time to time. I sorta assumed that before a hard fork, the default will change to the later hard fork before the actual hard fork anyway.

I think it's just a matter of how long we want to fuzz the latest target. In this instance, we decided to start about 2 weeks in advance but the default was changed only today (probably two days before release, if the release happens later this week?).

I'm fine with closing this PR if you think keeping it as is (explicitly targeting istanbul) is the right way to do it.

Maybe we should change it to "berlin" already?

Yeah, perhaps changing to berlin already is a good thing. Let me push an update

Is changing to `berlin` a consensus?
