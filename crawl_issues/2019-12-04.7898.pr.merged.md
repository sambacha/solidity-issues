I think you pushed over my fixes to the testing arch.

oh. That is quite possible. I was wondering why the tests work on my other machine just now

Tests are failing because of a peculiar feature of [stringToUTF8](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/preamble.js.html#stringToUTF8):
> maxBytesToWrite â€“ A limit on the number of bytes that this function can at most write out. If the string is longer than this, the output is truncated. The outputted string will always be null terminated, even if truncation occurred, as long as maxBytesToWrite > 0.

The issue is that `solidity_alloc` internally considers data as a `std::string`, therefore whatever written with Emscripten will have a "visible" trailing zero.

I see some quick options:
- introduce `resize`/`realloc`, which expands (zero pads) or shrinks (e.g. solc-js would shrink allocation by 1 byte...)
- change internal representation from string
- change back to `c_str()` from `data()`
- drop trailing zeroes in `wrapReadCallback`

I'm sure the C++ mages have better ideas.

> drop trailing zeroes in wrapReadCallback

I'm more and more convinced this it the right choice. Implemented it in 
34a0d4d.

@christianparpart @ekpyron @chriseth @leonardoalt @Marenz @erak any opinions?

``solidity_resize`` is a *very* bad idea.
It is likely to allocate new memory internally, changing what ``data()`` returns, which makes it impossible to free it and will result in a pretty much guaranteed abort.

If implemented at all, then ``solidity_resize`` would need to return ``.data()`` as well and the caller would have to discard the old pointer and only use the new one (especially ``solidity_free`` would have to be called on that new pointer). But I think that's extremely messy. (The only reason why it doesn't abort as it stands, is because the resize is only called to truncate and it's unlikely that it will actually reallocate for a single byte - but nothing prevents it from doing so, making this rely entirely on undefined behaviour - let alone that nothing prevents people from calling this to actually increase the string, which is highly unlikely to work).

Since ``C++11``, ``data()`` is guaranteed to return a (writable) zero-terminated string (i.e. do the exact same thing as ``c_str()`` only writable). So you can just pass one byte more than the allocated size to ``maxBytesToWrite`` in ``stringToUTF8`` and it will be fine (whether that's nice and clean is a different question, but I'd say it's fine, if properly documented, as in ``solidity_alloc(size)`` will allocate ``size+1`` bytes of memory: ``size`` bytes for data plus a zero byte for termination, which is guaranteed to be pre-filled with zero and may be written to, but only with another zero - that's exactly what the C++17 spec says to the termination byte of ``std::string::data()`` as well).

So IMO we should really not have ``solidity_resize`` under any circumstances.

So two options:
- Remove any trailing zero *after* ``takeOverAllocation`` on our end, while calling ``solidity_alloc(size+1)`` on the javascript side.
- Allow the caller to write one zero byte past the allocated memory. (if properly documented that's my preferred choice).

Note that the return of ``solidity_compile`` is fine, since ``data()`` is guaranteed to be zero-terminated in >C++11, so that part's fine either way.

My argument for "drop trailing zeroes in wrapReadCallback" (please check the implementation in  34a0d4d) is the following:
- From the perspective of the caller (solc-js), `solidity_alloc` is only supposed to allocate some memory with the given size, but the caller should have no need to care how that memory is represented by Solidity.
- Again from the perspective of the caller, when returning data from the callback, all it should care is that it wrote a zero-terminated string into the memory area. Therefore it is the compiler's responsibility to resize the internal representation.

As a result I don't think we should go with allowing to write +1 bytes as that is `strcpy` level madness.

Are you sure you actually want to link to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/34a0d4df3f31c2b41cf5f9d49cfdb1e6b17b9ddf ? That's the commit adding ``solidity_resize`` and that's (as I argued above) really bad, especially as it's written in that commit.

Resizing in ``wrapReadCallback`` after ``takeOverAllocation`` on the other hand is indeed a viable alternative and I'd be fine with that. (However, since ``std::string`` and ``std::string::data()`` in particular is specified like that anyways, I really see no harm in going the other way and allowing to write a zero (and *only* a zero) to ``*(solidity_alloc(size) + size)``. Arguably we could even do both - allow writing a zero to ``solidty_alloc(size) + size`` *and* truncate the string after the first zero byte in ``wrapReadCallback`` anyways, if there is one).

But yeah, basically I'm fine with anything that doesn't require to expose ``resize`` :-). I mainly got a mail with that particular commit message in the subject and thought I need to prevent that ;-).

You are right. In both cases I wanted to link 3ba9871.

How do you enforce the "only" part?

Ah yes, that looks much better. The only downside is that we actually need to look through the entire string for this. But yeah, it's a valid solution and I'd not oppose it.

In the same way in which you enforce not writing beyond the allowed range in general - by specifying and documenting it... that's also what ``std::string::data()`` does for C++ - it's valid to write a zero there (i.e. to ``*(str.data() + str.size())``), but if you write anything but a zero there, then it's undefined behaviour. We don't "enforce" not writing to ``*(solidity_alloc(size) + 10*size)`` in any way either, so this would be similar.

This is ready from my side. Need to remove the "[REMOVE PRIOR TO MERGING]" commit prior to merging.
