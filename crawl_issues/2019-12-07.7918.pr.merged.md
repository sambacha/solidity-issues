# [\#7918 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7918) `merged`: Add assertion for contract name clash in the resolver in CompilerStack

Oops it seems this was never created as a PR:

Tests pass so we likely catch this already. But if we want to be safe, perhaps only merge for 0.6.0 as that could have other bugs (as all new breaking releases do).

LGTM, but needs rebasing & squashing

Rebased and actually changed it back to "do not overwrite". What was the reason for overwriting the contract in the original PR?

Not sure I understand but the original version added an assertion that the fqdn wasn't used yet.

@chriseth anyway your version looks good. If you want to merge it.
