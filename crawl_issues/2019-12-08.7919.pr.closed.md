@Marenz I have updated as many errors as I could find. Some tests fail due to the changes I have made to some of the error messages:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/52ef581763c2a50b8cfb42953c702b7a033e7898/libsolidity/analysis/ViewPureChecker.cpp#L182
I have tried to update the tests accordingly:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/52ef581763c2a50b8cfb42953c702b7a033e7898/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/010_type_conversion_for_comparison.sol#L6

Please, let me know if there is anything that should update in my PR?

@Marenz Looking through the error messages, I'd propose the following rule of thumb for quotes:
- all keywords
- all types
- all user-defined types
- all opcodes
- all magic members
- (not sure yet) operators (like unary +)

@birtony There's a way to semi-automatically update the (at least .sol-file-based) tests. You just have to build and run `./build/test/tools/isoltest`, which compares the error messages stated by the file with the actual output from the compiler, and helps you overwrite the old error messages in the file via command line input.

Your proposal sounds good to me @erak

Needs rebase and test updates. IIUC, there seems to be consensus on writing a helper function to quote a string (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7578#issuecomment-563168826). IIUC, the helper function may look like so.

```
string quotedString(string s)
{
   return "\"" + s + "\"";
}
```

TBD: Placement of said function. My guess: somewhere in libdevcore.

I'll take over this PR/feature

@erak we often have types like `int_const` etc.. should we quote those as well? Or take this example:
```
Type int_const 5221...(1225 digits omitted)...5168 is not implicitly convertible to expected type int256.
```

@Marenz I think it makes sense to also quote `int_const` since it's a type as well (even though an internal one). What's you take on this?

I tend to go with quoting it as well
