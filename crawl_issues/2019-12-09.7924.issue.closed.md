## Checklist for making a release:

### Requirements
 - [x] Lauchpad (Ubuntu One) account
 - [x] gnupg key (has to be version 1, gpg2 won't work) for `your-name@ethereum.org` created and uploaded
 - [x] Readthedocs account, access to the Solidity project
 - [x] Write access to https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum

### Pre-release
 - [x] Ensure that a Github project exists for the release.
 - [x] Check that all issues and pull requests from the Github project to be released are merged to ``develop``.

### Changelog
 - [x] Sort the changelog entries alphabetically and correct any errors you notice.
 - [x] Create a commit on a new branch that updates the ``Changelog`` to include a release date.
 - [x] Run ``./scripts/tests.sh`` to update the bug list.
 - [x] Create a pull request and wait for the tests, merge it.

### Create the Release
 - [x] Create Github release page: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/new
 - [x] On the release page, select the ``release`` branch as new target and set tag to the new version (e.g. `v0.5.4`) (make sure you only `SAVE DRAFT` instead of `PUBLISH RELEASE` before the actual release)
 - [x] Thank voluntary contributors in the Github release page (use ``git shortlog -s -n -e origin/release..origin/develop``).
 - [x] Create a pull request from ``develop`` to ``release``, wait for the tests, then merge it.
 - [x] Make a final check that there are no platform-dependency issues in the ``solidity-test-bytecode`` repository.
 - [x] Wait for the tests for the commit on ``release``, create a release in Github, creating the tag (click the `PUBLISH RELEASE` button on the release page.)
 - [x] Wait for the CI runs on the tag itself (travis and appveyor should push artifacts onto the Github release page).
 - [x] Run ``scripts/create_source_tarball.sh`` while being on the tag to create the source tarball. Make sure to create ``prerelease.txt`` before: (``echo -n > prerelease.txt``). This will create the tarball in a directory called ``upload``.
 - [x] Take the tarball from the upload directory (its name should be ``solidity_x.x.x.tar.gz``, otherwise ``prerelease.txt`` was missing in the step before) and upload the source tarball to the release page.

### PPA
 - [x] Change ``scripts/release_ppa.sh`` to match your key's email and key id.
 - [x] Run ``scripts/release_ppa.sh release`` to create the PPA release (you need the relevant openssl key).
 - [ ] Wait for the ``~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum-static`` PPA build to be finished and published for *all platforms*. SERIOUSLY: DO NOT PROCEED EARLIER!!! *After* the static builds are *published*, copy the static package to the ``~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum`` PPA for the destination series ``Trusty`` and ``Xenial`` while selecting ``Copy existing binaries``.
 - [x] Check that the Docker release was pushed to Docker Hub (this still seems to have problems, run ``./scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh v0.x.x``).

### Homebrew
 - [x] Update the version and the hash (``sha256sum solidity_x.x.x.tar.gz``) in https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/blob/master/solidity.rb

### Documentation
 - [x] Build the new version on https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/ (select `latest` on the bottom of the page and click `BUILD`)
 - [x] In the admin panel, select `Versions` in the menu and set the default version to the released one.

### Release solc-js
 - [x] Increment the version number, create a pull request for that, merge it after tests succeeded.
 - [x] Run ``npm publish`` in the updated ``solc-js`` repository.
 - [x] Make sure to push the tag ``npm publish`` created with ``git push --tags``.

### Post-release
 - [x] Create a commit to increase the version number on ``develop`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and add a new skeleton changelog entry.
 - [x] Merge ``release`` back into ``develop``.
 - [x] Announce on Twitter and Reddit.
 - [ ] Lean back, wait for bug reports and repeat from step 1 :)

The ppa build will be fixed with 0.6.0
