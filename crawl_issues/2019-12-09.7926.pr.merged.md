I checked against npm's semver module and it turns out that the original implementation was identical to npm's.

It turns out that `^0` should in fact match `0.5.1-pre`, but it does not in the current implementation. This we need to fix, but I kind of remember that `^0` is special and different from `^1`.

OK, it turns out that `^0` should not match `0.5.1-pre`, but it should match `0.5.1`. I think I fixed it now.
