We're using an external tool [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint), so new features break our CI.
For reference I'm linking the tracking issue from the other side: https://github.com/protofire/solhint/issues/170.

@axic Looks like it's not done yet.

PR #7962 was just closed, not merged and the check seems to be still disabled on `develop`: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/804bd8f6dd117b7dec62e179cde663d29a31fc85/.circleci/config.yml#L981

I think this is actually a duplicate of #7436.
