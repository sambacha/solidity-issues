# [\#7955 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7955) `closed`: Reserve from and unsafe as keywords

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2019-12-10 16:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7955):

And also update documentation/chanelog with all the new keywords.

- `from` is #1687 
- `unsafe` is from #796
- `copy` #6040

I would like to actually revive #6040 and reserve `copy` too.

Will move the keyword fixes (and not the new additions) from here to #7954.

Didn't we say `unchecked` instead of `unsafe`?

Do we really want to reserve them? Reserving them would only make sense if we intend to make kind-of-breaking changes as non-breaking.

Yes, we ended up with `unchecked`, but for a while thought `unsafe` could be useful.

I hope we can implement #1687 before the next breaking release, that's the motivation for `from`.

Should also consider `ascii` from #5167.

- `from` is not needed, because it too common of a word, and the `import` parser already implements it as parsing a literal
- `unsafe` has no clear use yet compared to `unchecked`
- `copy` is part of a very early discussion (and not the factory syntax I thought it was)
- `ascii`/`unicode` is planned for 0.7.0
