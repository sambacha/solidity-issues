## Abstract

Currently, we invoke the `protoc` compiler on the command line to generate C++ protobuf bindings. I just realized that there is a cleaner way to do it via a cmake macro. Adding the following line should do the trick, where ${PROTO_SRCS} and ${PROTO_HDRS} are the C++ source/header files generated by the protoc compiler.

```
protobuf_generate_cpp(PROTO_SRCS PROTO_HDRS foo.proto)
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
