Nitpick: `with` is usually shortened to `w/` (where it makes sense, and not `/w` :wink:)

Something that's been in the back of my mind that's related to this is that there should be an option to do extended error recover _without_ ast generation. 

This would allow future bugs of this sort not to block use of use of extended error recovery. And there may be cases where you want extended error recovery without the AST generation.

@rocky What do you mean by _extended_ error recovery? In which aspects is that different to what's currently implemented?

@erak it has been a while since I looked at this. When a programmer uses the `--error-recovery` switch, two things happen:

1. the Steve C Johnson-style error recovery kicks in. This is a parser thing.
2. (partial) AST generation can happen when there are errors

However 2 may SEGV, while 1 never has. 

Suppose I have a front-end tool that makes use of the additional error message. If the program SEGVs then the tool doesn't get those additional messages because solc dies first.

A developer is then tempted to turn off getting the additional error messages to avoid the solc SEGVs, even though the tool can benefit in having those additional error messages.

In doing the experimental VSCode extension I ran into this and even mentioned it. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhQ0gO9Jzx8&t=9s.  

The SEGV that this addresses been in there for 3 months (and a couple of releases). 
Who knows if this will be the last SEGV problem as a result of partial AST generation? Separating additional parser error recovery from parital AST generation is therefore, I think, beneficial.
