# [\#7965 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7965) `closed`: Remove `pc` from Yul
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

Since Yul offers no option for direct jumps, there doesn't seem to be a good reason to expose the `PC` opcode.

Decision in call: Warning in 0.6.x, erorr starting from 0.7.x.

Please note that code like this produces different results with and without optimization. Perhaps another reason to remove `pc()`

```
pragma solidity >= 0.0.0;
contract C {
        function test() public returns (int)
        {
                int8 v0 = int8(0xdc4c7fbf8ec49ab53bc225a482aad76de9d21c98cbf2a163c351192dfaec2e05);
                assembly {
                        v0 := pc()
                }
                return int(v0);
        }
}
```

Here's a weird side-effect of `pc()` being a certain value on optimization and overwriting memory range `0x40-0x60` in a specific manner that triggers an out-of-gas error *only* on optimized version of the code :-)

```
pragma solidity >= 0.0.0;
contract C {
        function test() public pure returns (int r)
        {       
                assembly {
                        // pc() + 16 overwrites a more significant byte
                        // in the optimized version than the unoptimized one
                        // making the location pointed to by free memory
                        // pointer too large. This cause out-of-gas selectively
                        // for optimized code at the time a value needs to be
                        // written at the location pointed to by the free memory
                        // pointer.
                        mstore8(add(pc(), 16), 0x1)
                        r := pc()
                }
        }
}
```
