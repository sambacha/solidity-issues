## Description

We are getting linking error while trying to build `solc` (`v0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05`) with clang-6:
```

clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
solc/CMakeFiles/solc.dir/build.make:129: recipe for target 'solc/solc' failed
```

But when we try to build with `gcc` it builds fine.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

## Environment

- Compiler version: clang-6
- Boost version: 1.65.1
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS

## Steps to Reproduce

Use clang-6.0, boost 1_65_1 and try to build `solc` (`v0.4.19+commit.c4cbbb05`)

This looks like mismatched versions of boost or the standard library. Does this also happen with other versions of Solidity?

Sorry for the late answer, I will try ASAP and get back to you here. 
Thanks!

@degrigis Did you manage to solve this in the end?

Hey there, I completely forgot about this issue, sorry!
We eventually moved from this particular project, but iirc @chriseth answer was on point, there was a mismatching between boost libraries :)

Thanks for the update!

I'm closing it in that case.
