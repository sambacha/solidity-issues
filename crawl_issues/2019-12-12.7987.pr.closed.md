# [\#7987 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7987) `closed`: Fix ICE when calling unimplemented base/super function

fixes #7314

I need to use the `resolveDirectBaseContracts` function from the override checker. I am currently not sure what the best way to do that is. I could pull it out into a different or extra file.. I could move my check into the override checker.. or something else?

I see this is in the 0.6.0 project.. but it doesn't need to be, nothing here is breaking. So if this is blocking feel free to move it to 0.6.1

Please do not change the behaviour of `super`, I think the two should be considered independent of each other.

I was doing that in response to

> The way we solved it with super in #5130 is sub-optimal because it just removes non-implemented functions from the member list. Instead, a specific error should be thrown.

updated to exclude super

Updated. The check happens now as soon as we access the member.
I am not too happy with the deep if nesting. I could make it more linear by putting it in an extra function. Let me know if you prefer that.

This (valid?) test case throws a different ICE? Perhaps unrelated but documenting it here in any case.

```
abstract contract a {
    function f() virtual public;
}
contract b is a {
    function f() public override {}
    function g() public { a.f(); }
}
```

throws this

Good finds! Not sure about that extra test case you found. We certainly shouldn't get an ICE, but I want to hear what @chriseth has to say before changing my code

I think we have to discuss that at a more basic level. Do we want `A.f.signature` to work? Do we want `A.f` itself to generate an error? Or do we want `A.f` to result in a function type that is not callable?

I would say ``A.f.signature`` should work and thereby merely accessing ``A.f`` alone is fine, but ``A.f`` is only callable or convertible to an actual function pointer, if ``A.f`` is implemented, so both ``A.f();`` or ``some_function_pointer = A.f;`` are errors.

Part of my reasoning would be that ``A.f.signature`` should even work in general, i.e. in a contract that does not even inherit from ``A``. So stuff like this should work:
```
interface I {
  function f() external;
}
contract C {
  function g() public returns (bytes4) { return I.f.selector; }
}
```

And for that we'd need to have a specific type for ``I.f`` anyways... which is a special kind of function type that is not callable and not convertible to function pointers... and that's the very same type I'd use for unimplemented base functions as well.

Ah, yes: for reference: access to selectors via contract names in general is tracked as https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3506 and staged for 0.6.2 as well.

@Marenz We now merged https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8105 , which introduces a new kind of ``FunctionType::Kind::Declaration`` which can be used for a nicer solution to this - there will still be some subtleties involved, though - if you reference unimplemented public or external base functions by the name of the base, they will just get a function type of kind ``FunctionType::Kind::Declaration``. Probably internal ones as well, but they won't get the ``selector`` native member. For implemented public base functions we have to check, if it's nicer to keep them as internal function type kinds, or whether we let the declaration kind be callable in this case (I suspect the former will be less work).

So: do you want to continue with this based on that, or should I take over this PR as well?

As discussed with @Marenz in chat: I'm taking this over now.
