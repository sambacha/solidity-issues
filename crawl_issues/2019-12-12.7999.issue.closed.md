When I talked to @gnidan at Devcon he mentioned this would probably be more useful than the solc-js callback

Is our preference clearly for z3 or cvc4?

z3 because it has a Horn solver as well which we use for the CHC engine

Careful: The docker image is also used to build the static binary - we have to see if that is still possible and how large it gets.

Since it's a docker image anyway I would guess the size increase won't be meaningful.

The binary is exported to the release page as `solc-static-linux` to be used without docker.

@chriseth, for your reference, a docker image with solc v0.5.15 and z3 on alpine has a compressed image size of 62.78 MB. 
 
https://hub.docker.com/r/yuetloo/solc_z3

The downloaded image size is 167MB.

Is this done? Is this more important now that we have dynamic z3 loading?

I think not done, but not really affected by dynamic z3 loading either.

Ah, this is the "release solc image".

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
