# [\#8004 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8004) `merged`: abiv2 proto converter: Resize dynamic storage arrays via push

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-12-12 17:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8004):

Fixes #7960 and #8018 

Earlier we resized dynamic storage arrays by writing to the length field, but now don't do that since the length field of an array is read-only.

~~Note that this is still a draft pull request because I want to make sure that a different crash (see https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/pull/227) is not related to the issue this PR addresses.~~
