Weird, my macos clang wasn't as pedantic as CI's :wink:

I'm not proud of the renaming for avoiding shadowing, but it did spot one mistake.

Shadowing is super annoying as it depends on compiler version, none of these failures are shown on macos.

Do we *really* want to disallow shadowing :-)? If we really want to, I'd manage to cope, but to me personally that feels much more annoying than helpful... what mistake did that reveal?

@ekpyron I can't fully remember, but it did find this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8013#discussion_r359476670

That's not *really* an error, though :-)... I mean it's nicer after the change, but it wasn't wrong before...

This commit 3ecbcbb001  works. I'd prefer merging that and deal with shadowing separately. Any comments?

@ekpyron btw if shadowing is annoying, don't even dare to look at implicit conversion warnings ðŸ˜¨

Haha, yeah, I can imagine, but warnings on narrowing conversions I'd much rather have than on shadowing :-). So I'd go ahead without that commit, but yeah - feel free to vote me down on the shadowing stuff, if you think it's worthwhile :-) - I could live with it.

Decision from call: do not enable shadowing warning.

The travis failure is the bytecode uploader.
