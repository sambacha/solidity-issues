I've started reviewing this, but seems easier after merging #8015, because then we know which ones supposed to work and which don't.

Sorry I think you need to refill this also (please make sure to squash all of that).

Sorry to bug you again, but can rebase (or enable edits from maintainers)? I think tests will work again after a rebase.
