It would be nice to have some well defined rules and a linter for it. I think the "Yul printer" practically achieves that.

Yes, a linter would be good.

You can actually just use solc for that, it will pretty-print the yul code after parsing.

Yes, I've mentioned that in the opening comment. This is mostly about defining the rules.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
