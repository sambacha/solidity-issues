Yeah, I'd also suggest linking to the explanation as well

From @bshastry : explain what happens inside
```
uint8 y;
uint16 z;
// Is y + z implicitly converted to uint16 which is then implicitly converted to uint256?
uint x = y + z;
```

(also say that each sub-expression has its own inferred type)
