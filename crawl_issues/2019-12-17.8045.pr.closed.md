# [\#8045 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8045) `closed`: WIP: Debug information for local variable->stack slot

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25710654?u=ed58383d44cf7ca2dd5926cbdf3501c2831f725c&v=4" width="50">[thomasbernardi](https://github.com/thomasbernardi) opened issue at [2019-12-17 21:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8045):

### Description

This PR adds a combined-json option to output a per-instruction map from solidity variable names to EVM stack offsets. This information helps downstream static analysis tools translate high level program annotations to the bytecode level. The output format is similar to the format used for source mappings.

### Discussion

This PR is intended as a proof-of-concept. As implemented, this feature has already been useful for Certora's verification tool. However, it is probably not ready to be merged as-is. We would like to start a design discussion around supporting this kind of debugging information in Solidity. Once we have converged on a design, we'll be happy to polish up this PR per the contribution guidelines.

### Unresolved Design Issues

- is it better to use --combined-json or --standard-json?
- is there some way to unify this with `storageLayout`s?
- what would the best output format be?

Hello @thomasbernardi! 

Thank you for your contribution!
Would you like to join our [Monday meeting](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#team-calls) next week to discuss this?

We can discuss this any time, but I do not think it is useful to keep this half-completed here.
