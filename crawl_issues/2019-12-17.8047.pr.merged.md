Supposedly the version bytes in the metadata changed from `0x000600` to `0x000601` which was enough to move it over the threshold ðŸ˜‰ 

(For others reading: zero bytes are charged less, than non-zero bytes at deploy time)

I though this is factored in, but maybe just the metadata hash and not the version number.

Well the tests have a range but likely we were increasing costs with Istanbul and they were never retuned. This just happened to spill them over?
