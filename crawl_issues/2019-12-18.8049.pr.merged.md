```

It is still failing on MSVC. @chriseth what do you think about pulling the long polyfill string out into `EVMPolyfill.yul` and including it in the file somehow?

How about just using their hint? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2026?view=vs-2019
