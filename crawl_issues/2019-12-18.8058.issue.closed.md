Code for e.g. a very long string constant consisting of the same letter should be turned into a loop. In general, we might be able to detect a linear relation between variables and turn that into a loop. Linear relations, in turn, should be useful to replace multiplications inside a loop by additions to a loop variable.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
