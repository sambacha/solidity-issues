I am not sure if that is what @ekpyron had in mind. This complicates things because we use a different mechanism in the reference resolver than in the type checker.

Ok, then I need to defend this :-).

First of all: it indeed doesn't strictly speaking implement scoping correctly for for-loops, but we could actually remove any tracking of scoping anyways, since we disallow shadowing, so if anything, this would indicate to me that we can further simplify this [to be honest I wasn't paying enough attention to the discussion between @Marenz and @axic above that triggered the introduction of scopes here] and move further *away* from the yul analyzer.

Secondly: the "ignore all errors"-hack with the fake error reporter was just horrible ;-). I'm not sure why we'd want to defend obvious abuse of one construct for purposes it was obviously never meant to, against splitting it up into the two (resp. several) different and separate things that they actually are ;-). We even had bugs because of this abuse already...

Thirdly: as I mentioned above: this is only meant as the first step, we plan to remove the remaining occurrences of this construct later as well - but I don't see a need to force all of that into one single PR.

And lastly: Actually @Marenz initially put all of this into its own subclass - it was I who suggested to make it part of the resolver itself, since I'd think of resolving solidity references into yul as part of the same process of resolving references within solidity alone (a.k.a. resolving references to solidity variables) and I prefer the idea of one class just descending further into yul. Also since we don't actually need the scopes anyways, I'd say we can just put the remaining members directly inside ``ReferencesResolver``. But I'd also be fine with a separate class for this and passing the needed members from ``ReferencesResolver`` down to it (only poor @Marenz would need to move stuff back and forth again :-)).

Another thing: moving further forward I would actually propose to have a generic (probably even type-erased) annotation for external references in ``yul::Identifier`` itself (we need a generic mechanism for that in the long-term, if we want other languages to compile to yul and have us compile further from there), which would eliminate the need for annotating the inline assembly block with a map from identifiers only so that we later need to look up stuff from that map again - which would further reduce the yul-specific state required in the references resolver.

If we wanted to, we could actually also replace the last theoretically remaining yul-specific member ``insideFunction`` in the references resolver by setting the scope of ``m_resolver`` to ``nullptr``. And we'll in fact probably need to do something like that once we have globally scoped yul functions, but I would have postponed that to that respective PR. But in the long run I'd expect the yul specific state to actually disappear entirely...

If this is only about discovering shadowing, then it's indeed different. The ast json test can of course change if it leads to an error later, so we do not need scoping. If we remove the scopes, the yul state degrades to "inside function" and "annotation", which can just stay in the resolver class as you say, Daniel.
