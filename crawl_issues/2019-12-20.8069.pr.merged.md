# [\#8069 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8069) `merged`: Move scope of Scopable into new ScopableAnnotation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2019-12-20 02:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8069):

### Description

Move scope field from Scopable to annotation. This makes `Scopable` a truly constant class and follows the practice of having mutable state of ASTNodes in the annotations.

This should not change any semantics for consumers that only use `Scopable::scope`.
