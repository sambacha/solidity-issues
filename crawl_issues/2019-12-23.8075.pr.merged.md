# [\#8075 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8075) `merged`: Refactor namespaces

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2019-12-23 15:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8075):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7644

Implements the namespace changes as discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7644#issuecomment-555020282

i.e.:

```
solidity            - root namespace
solidity::util      - language-independant utility functions (old devcore)
solidity::langutil  - language-dependant utility API (such as old langutil)
solidity::evmasm    - EVM Assembly
solidity::yul       - yul API
solidity::frontend  - language frontend (including analysis and codegen)
```

### Status

so far it builds and links from scratch up to linking and successfully running soltest. There shouldn't be too much left (e.g. fuzzer), which I'll be doing next, but I wanted to create the PR already.

NB: It'll be squashed once everything builds.

### NOTE

This is going to be a **huge** PR, so once it's building and hopefully not too many reviewers change requests coming, I'd suggest to merge this one as early as possible to avoid ending up in rebase-merge-conflict-fixing-loop next year. :)

Why don't you do this one library at a time to reduce the size? Perhaps starting with libdevcore would be a good idea.

I started like this but very soon realized that it would have taken me 10 times longer to actually do that. I did not want to touch almost every file 4 times for different commits/PRs just to change 1-4 namespace lines in each. I hope that is okay, I consider the namespace changes now complete. and I do not need to touch them any further (I hope) :-D

> Some minor random comments that I noticed... The main question is whether there should be a policy about always importing `util` or never importing `util`, since that's rather inconsistent in the current PR.

@ekpyron as mentioned IRL already (just for the records), I prefer to fully qualify, but as soon as it becomes a mess (i.e. too many of them causing the code to be unreadable, exhausting to write) I prefer to import in order to keep the code more concise.

Yeah, that's what I meant - the question is whether that's ok or whether we want to stick to the previous policy that prefers to generally import. Or at least choose some general policy, since deciding on a case-by-case basis quickly becomes a mess in itself. I myself don't mind too much, but it feels like something that might be worth some discussion.

EDIT: and for the sake of the argument: think long-term: add a function to a file that uses a lot of stuff from a previously unimported namespace - do you then import it and change everything else? Then you move the function to a different file - do you even think about it again at that point? Do you un-import it then? I think over time lack of a general policy is bound to result in quite an inconsistent coding style. The question is whether in this detail that matters too much or not (especially since due to cases with conflicts this can't be handled entirely uniformly anyways).

With today's IDE's (even VIM) that's quickly done, and yes, I'd do that (I've to cross my fingers here probably as rules are there to be occasionally broken)

@ekpyron I've left some of your reviews ignored (intentionally, all of the *same* type, with the first one being commented). I probably can't work on this PR for the next 48-96 hours, so I'd be more then pleased if you'd take this one over with whatever follows and I'll grab the diff later to see what has changed on top (don't forget to squash the very last commit then).

Take care,
Chris.

Yeah, but that's not the point - the point is (1) the resulting noise in PR diffs and related stuff and (2) in the long term we're bound to end up with more and more cases where the same thing is referred to in different ways in different files for no apparent reason... but yeah, I'm not that motivated to argue for this too much, since it's not that important to me, but I'll ask for more opinions tomorrow and we'll see :-).

Alright, I'll try to get it merged before it becomes a rebase-menace then :-).

I rebased and squashed (at least the fixup commit - we could squash everything into one commit).

Rebased again, luckily without problems so far.
