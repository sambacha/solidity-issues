Changed the bug list entry only to say "introduced: 0.6.0", because that is when the yul optimizer was activated. There is another PR that fixes it and adds another bug list entry which states "low" severity before 0.6.0.

Code and tests look good to me. Fuzzing overnight did not find anything. I'm trying to check if the bug may be introduced by var decl/assignments  created by function inliner as you mentioned.

`osx` build seems to fail because of a compiler warning -> error (unused variable in SolidityEndToEndTests.cpp). Seems unrelated to this PR.
