We should really implement ``copyof`` ;-).

> @ekpyron ? Sorry, don't understand the comment…

Sorry, basically spam. ``copyof`` is a potential 0.7.0 feature (which I'd already have liked to be in 0.6.0), which will make this whole thing much easier - basically nothing will ever be copied, except if you use ``copyof`` - then everything will be copied. That would make this job here much easier :-).

@leonardoalt @bshastry @chriseth I had a chat with @ekpyron  here and had a sudden memory of were work around this was done before, and it's here - https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#data-location-and-assignment-behaviour

Reading through this, we did some comparison and kind of realised that it's much clearer than this section we're trying to polish, and uses much better terminology anyway. As far as we could tell, it contained pretty much all of the information needed. Unless we missed something, is a better solution actually just to cut this "Complications for Arrays and Structs" section? And maybe link to the section above from relevant parts of the remaining content?

Didn't hear anything so tried replacing text with a partial shared between multiple places, this might be brittle, not sure.

Ping @ChrisChinchilla - can you change this to a link as mentioned in the comment?

Can you squash?

Also, this looks a bit weird:
