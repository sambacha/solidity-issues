# [\#8098 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8098) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Replace some shared_ptr by unique_ptr/raw

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-01-04 20:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8098):

Because `EncodingContext` kept a `shared_ptr` to the `Z3Interface` used by `Z3CHCInterface`, there was a confusion later when destructing the `z3::context` used by BMC's `Z3Interface` which caused a double free.
As previously instructed by @christianparpart , I'm replacing some `shared_ptr` by unique or raw, which fixes this issue.

I'm also not sure whether it'd actually be better to have the ownership of the interface be in ``EncodingContext`` plus ditching the ``setSolver`` thing entirely :-D... But that may not work or be less nice in the end, so fine with me to keep the ownership reversed (i.e. as it is in this PR).

`EncodingContext` doesn't know which solver to use, which depends on the engine. BMC uses `SMTPortfolio` which derives from `SolverInterface`, and CHC uses something that derives from `CHCSolverInterface`, and those are unrelated.
We can of course make `EncodingContext` aware of it, but that'd sound odd to me.

Ah yeah, my idea would have been to pass it to ``EncodingContext`` as constructor argument, but since ``CHCSolverInterface`` doesn't derive from ``SolverInterface`` it probably makes little sense and changing it is not worth the effort...

Yea, I wanted to do it like that, and in the first implementation `CHCSolverInterface` did derive from `SolverInterface`, but it quickly got messed up so I split them.
