# [\#8105 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8105) `merged`: Add a new Function Type referring to FunctionDefinition's without calling context and use it to allow selector lookup.

This is probably easiest to review commit by commit.
I first remove the defaulted ``_isInternal`` bool used to construct function types and replace it by an explicit ``kind`` argument, while reproducing the exact same behaviour as before.

Then I add the new ``Definition`` Kind and make it the default instead. So far if function types were needed without an actual calling context, the kind was "Internal" - now it is "Definition", which I'd say makes more sense.

Then finally I added all externally visible functions with kind "definition" as members to the contract TypeType and added appropriate assertions and type checks. Those members themselves for now can only be used for selector lookup with their "selector" members.

This partly fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3506 and is related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7987.
What is missing is proper handling of base contracts, which is what https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7987 tried to do, but which will be easier on top of this (as discussed with @Marenz).

Should have made this a draft... there's a few questions remaining, e.g. how to name those new kinds of function types - and generally, I need feedback about whether this seems like a reasonable direction to go.

@ekpyron did one pass, looks good at a first glance. There are a lot of changes though, I would like to look at it again.
Does it work to call `A.f()` is it is pure? Can you add tests for those?

Nope, calling ``A.f()`` for pure functions is something we could consider implementing in the future, but I don't plan to include it for this PR. It would only work, if we actually have an implementation for ``A.f`` and can inline, though... in any case: I'd consider that out of scope for this PR.

However, this is the main reason, why I think it's good to make the type of these things actually a ``FunctionType`` at all, instead of defining an entirely new kind of type for them :-).

(So calling ``A.f()`` isn't allowed in general and there's a test for that for a non-pure ``f``, but pureness doesn't make a difference for now - I can explicitly add a copy of that test with ``A.f`` being pure, though)

Yes that's what I meant

But yeah, I'm still not entirely sure whether distinguishing these things using a new ``FunctionType::Kind`` is the best way to go... we could also have a boolean flag instead... but the default of having a lot of stuff having ``m_kind`` being ``Internal``, e.g. for a type solely used to compute an *external* signature, didn't seem very clean either...

Added some explicit tests for pure functions.

Squashed it!
