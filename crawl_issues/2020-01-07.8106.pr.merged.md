### Description

The enum is very simple, so there should be little to no impact on compile times, and unlikely to change much, so there should be no impact on incremental builds.

This allows using `ContractKind` in more places. This need was found during #8091.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
