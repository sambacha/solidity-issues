What name?

The name of the compiler implementation, i.e. "official solc" or "soll".

Although I don't think any of the other compilers use metadata.

thought vyper must also support this - but seems it is not the case. Anyway it would make it more robust in the future when other compilers start supporting it. But has low priority - was just noting in the chat that I felt it is missing when writing a parser for the metadata and saw there is a version - but no explicit "version of what"? Only an implicit - "yea it *should* be solc"

There is the `language` field, isn't it?

We do not have a real use for this now. We can look at this again when other compilers implement metadata and / or standard io.
