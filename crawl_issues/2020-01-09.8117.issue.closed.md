In particular ``array elements are padded, but still encoded in-place`` and ``The encoding of an array is the concatenation of the encoding of its elements with padding.`` IMO aren't clear about what kind of padding it's going to be - apparently it's not always just padded to the right, but we'll need to check.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
