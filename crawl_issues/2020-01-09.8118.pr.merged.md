I'm not sure, if we want to add these to the repo, but in case anyone is interested, I'm parking them in this PR until we decide.

I created wasm soljson.js builds for all versions >0.4.4 <= 0.6.1 this way. The solc-js tests are passing entirely for >= 0.5.0 and there is a few failures I need to investigate for the 0.4 series, but it doesn't seem too critical.

Not sure where to put the soljson.js's and/or the build and test logs I have locally for others to have a look...

So what do we do with these scripts? I'm not sure about merging them as they are, but I also don't want to throw them away...

Added a readme to the script folder.
