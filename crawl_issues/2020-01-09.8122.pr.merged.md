# [\#8122 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8122) `merged`: Ignore empty options to (i)soltest

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-01-09 13:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8122):

Follow-up for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8100/

``scripts/tests.sh`` passes ``"$optimize"`` to ``soltest``, which ends up being an empty positional argument in ``boost::program_options`` - and all unrecognized positional arguments were turned into errors in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8100/.
This PR makes an exception for empty ones.

[still thinking ``boost::program_options`` is weird ;-)]
