**Labels**: `language server`

## Dependencies

- [x] PR: #10833 (commitS currently included here, too, for easier development)
- [x] PR: #10880

## Status
- [x] basic client/server communication working (tested in vim/neovim and its [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)) LSP plugin.
* [x] compilation errors are published to the client
* [x] Goto definition
* [x] Semantic highlighting
* [x] Find all references
* [x] REFACTOR: remove some of the abstractions in liblsp/solls in order to simplify the code / reduce the SLoC's
* [x] Merge into`solc` executable with CLI argument `--lsp` to enable LSP mode.
* [x] properly handle remapping
* [x] add some sort of configurability via JSON settings object (EVM version, ...)

### Thoughts

I think basicaly all standard LSP features that a user would expect look implementable except auto completion. Here I would suggest having a look at what clangd is doing.

My current take on this is:
1. parse as usual (fatal parser errors should be okay); if the parser has to parse an expression, such as `expression.` without the right hand side filled, a placeholder could be added to the AST node, denoting that there is an expression that looks incomplete (in case it is allowed to be filled)
2. the analyzer can take this into account and if auto completion position matches that, it'll fill the response with all the members of `expression`.

Also, I'd distinguish here between general error recovery that was once attempted an this kind of artificially generated syntax errors. The scope of auto completion generated syntax errors should limit the cases the parser has to deal with.

It may also be worth considering using a json-rpc library like https://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp resp https://github.com/jsonrpcx/json-rpc-cxx

We did use libjson-rpc-cpp in the past. It re-generates some wrappers upon "cmake ..", if I remember correctly and forced the use of a specific json library. In general, the experience was not without friction.

What is the plan here?

We want this, but with way fewer lines of code.

As (some time ago) discussed with @chriseth, I can reduce the amount of noise in this branch. But as far as I understood, it's a low prio feature, so that's why I didn't touch it since then. I'd wish to resume on this subject before Christmas though.

I can close the PR (but keep the branch), if the PR itself is polluting the PR-list.

Given the shared FileReader, I wonder if we should not just make this part of `solc`, e.g. `solc --lsp` runs it in LSP mode?

We should aim to modularize/cleanup solc anyhow, and this would be a good incentive to do so.

I agree, that way we also don't have to distribute another binary. - Is it OK to require a parameter to launch the LSP?

I think we can do this, but I also think that (almost) every other parameter would be mutually exclusive, as conficuration is passed from the connecting client (IDE) via a JSON settings object in the initialization.

For now, I think... maybe

1. continue as is in this branch to get the LSP functionality working
2. clean up solc interface
3. integrate lsp mode into solc

I am not so sure about wasm binaries how we could make use of the lsp mode natively there (by default lsp speaks stdio), too, so that ideally @ethereum/remix and VScode could make use of this, too.

Shows the sad state of affairs of C++ that small reusable libraries are not a thing. For example why do we need to reimplement a generic JSON-RPC library here?

I rarely say this, but I think we would be better off closing this PR and opening a new one with the same branch. The 260 comments here makes it impossible to see what has been addressed and what hasn't been.

(Deleted all the messages from @stackenbotten but it is still 225 comments.)

Closing PR and creating a new one (soon) based on same branch for easier code review.
