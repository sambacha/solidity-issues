## Description

It seems that in the docs, in the [blind auction example contract](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#id2), that there is a possible DoS vulnerability. In the `reveal()` function, we loop through the bids in this array: `bids[msg.sender].length`, which doesn't seem to have a limited amount of bids. If the current highest bid is low enough, a griefer with enough funds could make so many bids that the loop costs too much gas to fit in the block, resulting in unexpected effects.

I propose that instead of allowing users to have multiple bids, we accept only one bid per person, and simply replace user's old bid with newly submitted ones.

Thanks for noticing!
Note that these are only the bids set by a specific sender. Still, it could lead to the bid not being revealable. We could loop from the end and require to reveal one bid at a time, but that would make it more expensive and maybe also more complicated.

Other opinions?

Is there any benefit to users having multiple bids? As mentioned, I think users should only be able to have one bid, and if they'd like to change it, they could submit a new one, leading to the old one being deleted and the previous deposit being refunded.

The reason for multiple bids is disguising a real bid among fake bids - I hope this is explained in the text.

If the bid values aren't known then why do real bids have to be disguised? The only benefit I see to that is that you can make an auction look more popular than it actually is. Am I missing something here?

The ether transfer makes the bid values not totally invisible.

I think the solution here is to reveal one bid at a time - especially for an example contract this could be easier.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
