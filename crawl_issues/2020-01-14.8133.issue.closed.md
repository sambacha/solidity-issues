## Description

I'm working w/in a lerna monorepo & I'm trying to consolidate a couple related contract sub-repos into one module. Compiling the consolidated contracts gives me the following error:

}
```

I reported this via [waffle issue 178](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/issues/179) but upon further investigations it looks like it's not a problem w waffle itself but w the compiler inside the `ethereum/solc:0.5.15-alpine` image.

Compiling via truffle gives the same error when using compiler option: `version: "native"`:

```
Error: Error: spawnSync /bin/sh ENOBUFS
    at Object.compile (/root/node_modules/truffle/build/webpack:/packages/workflow-compile/legacy/index.js:80:1)
Truffle v5.1.6 (core: 5.1.6)
Node v12.13.0
```

I'm suspicious that I'm trying to compile too many contracts all at once and I'm getting some kind of out-of-memory issue.

I'm confident there aren't any circular dependencies lurking. Compilation works fine using solcjs, it's just the native compiler in alpine that's causing errors.

At the moment, a semi-working hack-around is to create two waffle.json files that each compile half the the contracts. The build succeeded when done in two steps like this before I integrated another chunk of contracts & now this third chunk always fails even if compiled separately (maybe bc it's importing contracts from the first two chunks?)

## Environment

- Compiler version: image `ethereum/solc:0.5.15-alpine` (also reproduced this issue in `ethereum/solc:0.5.11-alpine`)
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): constantinople
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Waffle & Truffle
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Haven't deployed contracts yet
- Operating system: Docker alpine

waffle.json

```
{
  "compiler": "native",
  "npmPath": "../../node_modules",
  "legacyOutput": true,
  "compilerOptions": {
    "evmVersion": "constantinople"
  },
  "sourcesPath": "./contracts"
}
```

## Steps to Reproduce

 - `git clone https://github.com/ConnextProject/indra.git`
 - `cd indra && git checkout b3856cf4`
 - `make contracts-native`

Sorry, no single solidity file seems to be to blame. Problem arises when compiling lots of contracts & the above project will repro the error reliably. First run will take a while since it needs to download lots of dependencies but subsequent runs of `make contracts-native` will go much more quickly.

Thanks for reporting! Unfortunately, there is not much to read from the error messages. How much memory does the machine have you are running this on? What happens if you run the compiler directly without truffle or waffle?

ENOBUFS does not sound like a problem with the memory used by the compiler, but rather with the buffers used to send input and output back and forth. Maybe you selected too much output from the compiler and nodejs cannot handle it?

I am trying to compile smart contracts but it has resulted in below mentioned buffer space related error:

```
> Compiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol
> Compiling openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol
Error: spawnSync /bin/sh ENOBUFS
    at Object.spawnSync (internal/child_process.js:1045:20)
    at spawnSync (child_process.js:597:24)
    at execSync (child_process.js:642:15)

```

Is anyone able to solve this issue?

This issue is indeed an issue w the buffer size between a node process & it's solc child process being too small.
For those using waffle, the buffer size limit will be increased once [PR 205](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/pull/205) is merged/published.

Worked around the error by setting `docker:false` int the `truffle-config.js`.
- node v14.3.0
- Truffle v5.1.26
- solc v0.6.1

`docker:false` in `truffle-config.js` works!

defined [here](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#solc). 
```
docker: <boolean>, // Use a version obtained through docker
```
