Merges the Option class into the CommonOption class.
Most stuff here is just renaming, the relevant files to look at are:

* isoltest.cpp
* boostTest.cpp
* Common.[h.cpp]

fixes #7112

> Why do you merge classes?

Well, initially because @chriseth [said so](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7112#issuecomment-518228025): 
> The (boost) options class should be merged into the common options class and the options should be explicitly created. 

And if you think about it, we want `isoltest` and `soltest` to be able to do the same thing and have the same options as much as possible..

The options found in the now removed file were also used for isoltest tests but couldn't actually be changed using the commandline..

Regarding leaking memory.. it is a singleton.. it's created once and kept till the end of life of the program... 

But I kinda expected that someone would yell at me for this :P anyway, I pushed [an alternative](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/compare/035eeddcadb44da2daadee6f88890e8600b54388..2b10e4709cb2c0db75d38a97e04e1b6816993f7e) for you.

You don't intentionally leak memory. Not once, not ever :-).

I think your alternative is subject to type slicing, but I'd need to recheck...

Fixed a wrong fix of mine. Everything should be fine now.
