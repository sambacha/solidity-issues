When compiling a contract that has a 0.5.x-style fallback function using 0.6.1, the following error message is displayed:

```
ParserError: Expected a state variable declaration. If you intended this as a fallback function or a function to handle plain ether transactions, use the "fallback" keyword or the "ether" keyword instead.
```

The suggestion should tell the developer to use the `receive` keyword, not `ether` (which as far as I know doesn't exist).

(updated test expectations)
