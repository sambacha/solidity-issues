Discussion: Introducing curly braces would make this the only curly braces that do not contain a list of statements. Also, with simple indentation rules, this would cause double indentation. Finally, it currently "works".

We can revisit the issue when they annoy us.

my argument *for* curly braces is that it not just improves visual readability, but also helps alot in jumping forth and back in your editor via shortcuts. I personally do that a lot in VIM to jump based on braces.

Not having such a syntactic sugar would just make moving around less convenient.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
