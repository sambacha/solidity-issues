I think it is worth it, but it initially generates tons of errors (maybe we want to tweak the pylintrc some more).

@christianparpart it fails on CI:
> /usr/bin/python3: No module named pip

Maybe I am missing something, but that python script feels like overkill to me... wouldn't a simple bash script suffice?

```
find test scripts doc -iname '*.py' -exec pylint --rcfile="pylintrc" \{\} \;
```

@Marenz I think it's right on the edge of being overkill. But it comes with a nice reporting, which you wouldn't get with a simple bash one-liner. I think we would profit from this in the future, when migrating scripts from bash to python, which I would prefer. Don't know if that's wanted at all, but could be a reason to keep this PR as it is.

@christianparpart I'm reading https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/251823?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link. Shouldn't the error being printed red? At least this would make it easy to find. And also would justify the effort put into the reporting.

Thanks a lot for noticing! I thought this was a fresh-checkout but somehow it wasn't should be fixed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8239
