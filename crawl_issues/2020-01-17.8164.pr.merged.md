# [\#8164 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8164) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Minimal application

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-01-17 08:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8164):

### Description
This is the initial part of the implementation of #7806.

It provides a command-line application (`tools/yul-phaser`) which can already load `.yul` source code, apply optimizations and rank the resulting programs by their size. It runs a trivial (completely randomized) genetic algorithm and prints the result of each round to the console. ~The pull request includes a few unit tests but the coverage is still minimal.~

~This is still work in progress.~ The PR is ready.

#### Structure
- `Program` class encapsulates all the details of source code parsing, analysis and application of optimizations. An instance represents a syntax tree after a few hard-coded transformations (disambiguation, grouping, hoisting, etc.) and ready for arbitrary optimizations.
- `Chromosome` class defines a sequence of optimization steps. Provides methods for generating, changing and accessing its sequence. It does not know about `Program` and does not interact with it directly.
- `Population` class runs the genetic algorithm. It stores a set of chromosomes and refines it in subsequent algorithm rounds. It's mostly concerned with controlling the flow of the algorithm and does not itself do anything complicated. It uses `Chromosome` and `Program` to evaluate fitness of sequences.

#### Not yet implemented
1. No mutation or crossover yet. The algorithm just drops the worse half of the population in each round and refills it with randomized chromosomes.
2. No way to specify the seed for the random number generator yet.
3. ~Needs more unit tests. For now I have tests only for `Chromosome`.~
4. No saving and reloading of algorithm state. When interrupted, the state is lost.
5. A sequence is applied to the program only once. It's supposed to be applied a few times in a loop.
6. `Program` is loaded from file and parsed each time it's being evaluated. I should keep one initialized instance and make a copy when I need to apply optimizations to it.
7. Lots of stuff is still hard-coded. The program is not flexible enough for experimenting yet.

EDIT: All of the above will be implemented in subsequent PRs.

#### Known issues
1. ~`VarNameCleaner` is disabled for now because it throws `Source needs to be disambiguated` even though it is already disambiguated. `FullInliner` used to fail for me in the same way. `SSATransform` too but on `yulAssert()` instead. Both went away when I changed how I pass AST and other objects around (by value vs smart pointers/references). It's likely that I'm using it wrong or copying something that should not really be copied. I need to take a closer look at this.~

#### Questions
1. Should I worry about moving vectors of `std::string`s around? I realized that I could make almost all of them `char const*` and save some dynamic allocations because step names are just `constexpr`s but I'm not sure it's worth the time. It won't be a bottleneck anyway.
2. Is it OK to use plain `assert()` for sanity checks? `solAssert()` looks more like a normal check to me. It throws exceptions and does not get removed in release builds so I'm a bit reluctant to use it for heavier checks for invariants, preconditions and generally stuff that should not happen unless there is actually a bug in the code.
3. Since `yul-phaser` is not a library, I had to list all the necessary `.cpp` files again in `test/CMakeLists.txt` to have `soltest` link properly. This does not seem like a very good solution. Should I store those paths in some cmake variable? Or maybe try to create a library out of the classes I want to test?
4. Tests for `tools/yul_phaser/` seem like they should go into a subdirectory in `test/tools/` but that directory already exists and contains extra tools for testing so. It did not seem right to me to mix them with test cases so I put them in `tests/yul_phaser/` instead. Is that OK?

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Have you thought about using the string of abbreviated step names for the chromosome instead of the vector of strings of full names?

> Have you thought about using the string of abbreviated step names for the chromosome instead of the vector of strings of full names?

I thought about storing pointers to strings or `std::reference_wrapper`s (since they strings are static). But a vector of strings looked like it was meant to be the a canonical way to refer to optimisation steps and I didn't want to unnecessarily invent anything new here so I went with it. Now that you mention it, storing chars would be more efficient and still elegant enough with regards to the class API. I'll consider changing it but not in this PR.

I just pushed all my changes for this PR. It's now ready for another round of review. It adds a full set of tests, fixes all current review issues and adds a lot of small improvements.

All the modifications are in fixups and new commits so in theory you only need to look at them but there are a lot of fixups so it might be better to just review the whole thing again.

Here's a summary of changes not already mentioned in review comments above to make it easier to notice the differences:
1. New stuff
    - Tests for `Population`, `Program`, `Random` and `Chromosome`.
        - Some tests that deal with random stuff are probabilistic, but they're constructed in such a way that a false positive is not likely to happen within this lifetime of the universe :)
    - Added docstrings for classes.
2. Changes outside of `yul-phaser`
    - Changed `yul::Parser::parse()` factory method to return `unique_ptr` rather than `shared_ptr`. This way the caller can decide which one to use instead of being forced to use `shared_ptr`.
3. Changes to make stuff more testable
    - `Population.run()` takes a stream parameter instead of having `cout` hard-coded.
    - `ast()`, `operator<<` and `toJson()` in `Program` class.
    - `operator==` and `!=` in `Chromosome` class.
    - `individuals()`, `operator<<` in `Population` class. `measureFitness()` made `public`.
4. Small improvements and optimisations
    - A few more forward declarations instead of including header.
    - Always use references when declaring loop variables with `auto`.
5. Refactoring
    - Refactored `Population` constructors.
    - `protected` stuff in `Population` is now `private`.
    - Separate function for argument parsing in `main.cpp`.
    - `Program` is not supposed share its pointers so it now uses `unique_ptr` for everything. This required the change to `yul::Parser::parse()` mentioned above.
    - Removed the redundant `test_` prefix from my test case names. Wrapped all test suites in another one called `Phaser` to make it possible to run all phaser tests with `--run_test=Phaser`.
    - `BOOST_TEST` instead of `BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL` in tests.
    - `Population::MeanChromosomeLength` should have been called `Population::MaxChromosomeLength` since it's used as the number of trials in binomial distribution.

It might be a good idea to extract the changes to yulopti into its own PR. Also could you rebase and squash the rest?

Sure. I'll put it in a separate one.

> Also could you rebase and squash the rest?

Done.

Waiting for you to extract the changes to isoltest to its own PR before reviewing this a final time.

All review fixes done. In places where I think a change is not required or does not make sense because of the design changes in the upcoming PR I left a reply explaining why. I also resolved the comments where the issue was trivial or stuff has been moved to a different PR and will be reviewed there anyway.

 I have extracted the commits changing stuff outside of `yul-phaser` into three small PRs: #8213, #8214, #8215. I see that the first one has already been merged (thanks :)). The PRs are independent but since this one depends on all of them, I put them on top of each other. This unfortunately means that the changes from all of them will show also here. I could normally avoid that by changing the base branch of the PR but it looks like I can't do it if the base branch exists only in a fork.

Thanks a lot! Let's now get the small ones merged and then this one so you can finally continue your already ongoing work:)

Sure. I'm unfortunately starting late today (sorry that I was not available to make changes in #8214) but I'll try to get the remaining two sorted out now.

I just pushed a few minor cleanup commits extracted from my new branch (as fixups). This is trivial stuff that should not require re-reviewing:
- `Program`'s move constructor made public (was protected by mistake).
- Removed unnecessary `std::` from two `.cpp` files.
- Removed `assert()` that's now always true after a change to `size_t` from `Population::run()`.
- Moved the definition of `Population::measureFitness()` to a better spot in the `.cpp` file.
- Removed a temporary comment left by mistake in `Population::randomizeWorstChromosomes()`.

Done. All fixups squashed.

Yes, this one is next in line. After it comes a small one - #8223. And after that one a new, bigger pull request with the actual genetic algorithm that I'm aiming to have ready some time tomorrow.

Sure.

BTW, I found the option to enable it ([Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)) but it's unavailable on my PRs for some reason and I can't do it here. It's available when I'm submitting a PR from my private fork but not when doing so from `imapp-pl`.

Ok. I'll check it. All the checks were passing before so it's possible it's from something below. I see a comment saying that the build was failing here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7914#issuecomment-582474231. Has that problem been actually resolved before it was merged?
