# [\#8165 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8165) `merged`: yulopti: Add missing ConditionalUnsimplifier step

### Description
While working on #8164 I noticed two minor issues in `yulopti`:
- `ConditionalUnsimplifier` step was not available in the tool but present in `OptimiserSuite::allSteps()`. I suspect it might have been added later and nobody remembered to add it to the tool.
- A typo: repeated `f` in `(f)flatten`.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

I'm not sure it this change requires anything in README or Changelog. As for tests, the tool is just a single `.cpp` file and therefore does not have any as far as I can tell. Please let me know if any of these should be added after all.

@chriseth Was the ConditionalUnsimplifier left out by accident or removed for any particular reason? I can vaguely remember some discussions about it...

I see that `continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr` in CI is failing. It runs `scripts/bytecodecompare/storebytecode.sh` which returns an error. This is actually not caused by my PR. It's broken on `develop` too.

I investigated this and the direct cause is that that the `prepare_report.py` script it runs passes a `str` to `Popen.communicate()` when starting a child process but that function expects `bytes`. The fix is pretty simple and I'm going to submit a separate PR to patch it in a moment.
