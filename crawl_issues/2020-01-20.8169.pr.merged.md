# [\#8169 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8169) `merged`: Fix str/bytes mismatch crashing prepare_report.py when running storebytecode.sh

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-01-20 10:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8169):

### Description
I found a bug in `prepare_report.py` while investigating CI failures in #8165. The script uses unicode strings when raw byte arrays are expected and vice versa, which results in exceptions:
1) `Popen.communicate()` expects `bytes` (a raw, binary string) if `stdout`/`stderr` are open in binary mode but is given output from `json.loads()` which is str (an abstract unicode string). Encoding the `str` object into `bytes` using UTF-8 encoding fixes that.
2) `REPORT_FILE` gets opened in binary mode which means that functions like `write()` expect `bytes`. We're giving them `str` which results in an error. Changed mode to text solves the problem.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8156

I think this must have been caused by transition to Python 3. It would have worked fine on Python 2 as evidenced by the fact that there were no problems with it for almost a year after it was introduced in 19761a08fae727dfb0c4af1115fc8fb8d42ad1f4.

Oh, I did not see that issue. Well, should have been obvious that there would be one when stuff is failing on `develop` :)

It looks like `loads` also needs fixing:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.py", line 31, in <module>

    result = json.loads(out.strip())

  File "/usr/lib/python3.4/json/__init__.py", line 312, in loads

    s.__class__.__name__))

TypeError: the JSON object must be str, not 'bytes'
```

Yeah. Weird because it does not fail any more on my machine. But I'm not running the same Python version (3.8 instead of 3.4) so that might be the reason.

It's obviously right, since `communicate()` eats `bytes` so naturally it returns `bytes` in `out` too. `out` now needs a `decode()` before it can be passed to `loads()`. I'm pushing a commit that adds it.

I'll need to check why it does not fail for me because it should have.

Done. Should work now.

Looks like it's indeed a difference between interpreter versions. `json.loads()` should have been working with both `bytes` and `str` according to the docs but there was a bug and the function did not actually accept the former. The bug was fixed in Python 3.6 ([Issue 10976: accept bytes in json.loads()](https://bugs.python.org/issue10976)).

BTW, @chriseth my update is a separate `fixup!` commit so that reviewers can see what I changed but it should really end up as a part of the original commit. I'd like it to be squashed before it gets merged. Could you do that for me? Since it's an external PR, I won't be the one doing the merge. It's just a simple `git rebase -i --autsquash` but squashing it by myself before the PR gets reviewed kinda defeats the point.

Please rebase and squash
