### Description
Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7672#event-2930841870

I think this is the right section, and as the other `call*` functions listed beneath say they are "identical but", I think this enough.

- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)

@chriseth OK, I took another pass. I don't have a lot of information to work with here, so made a lot of assumptions, which I hope were correct. Especially with the gas cost error, as I think that's related, but maybe I'm wrong.

I am yet to add the "see below" message, and want to change the formatting a bit too.

Also, to clarify, is this all functions that begin with `call*`, or just `call`, `callcode`, `delegatecall`, `staticcall`?

There was an error when running `chk_coding_style` for commit `25b63fb0357c494864cca5ce0dde535b7c15e261`:
```
Error: Trailing whitespace found:
 docs/yul.rst:890:The ``call*`` instructions use the ``out`` and ``outsize`` parameters to define an area in memory where 
 docs/yul.rst:891:the return data is placed. This area is written to depending on how many bytes the called contract returns. 
 docs/yul.rst:892:If it returns more data, only the first ``outsize`` bytes are written. You can access the rest of the data 
 docs/yul.rst:893:using the ``returndatacopy`` opcode. If it returns less data, then the remaining bytes are not touched at all. 
 docs/yul.rst:894:You need to use the ``returndatasize`` opcode to check which part of this memory area contains the return data. 
 docs/yul.rst:895:The remaining bytes will retain their values as of before the call. If the call fails (it returns ``0``),

Please check that your changes are working as intended.
