# [\#8177 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8177) `merged`: Implement `new` with CREATE2 and function call options

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424752?u=2d50de05ec528b9b84f8b905a56e90669b0f8927&v=4" width="50">[Marenz](https://github.com/Marenz) opened issue at [2020-01-22 15:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8177):

Missing:
* [x] Proper tests for the generated CREATE2 code
* [x] CodeGen for calling functions using the new `fn{value:123, gas:43}()` syntax or an "not yet implemented" error
* [x] tests for the type checks on the options (i.e. salt has to be bytes32, etc)
* [x] tests and implementation in type checker that options cannot be given twice (neither in same options set (``f{value: 0, value: 0}``), nor by applying the options set twice (``f{value: 0}{value: 0}``))
* [x] tests and implementation that salt can only be used starting from the EVM version where create2 was introduced (@marenz)
* [x] ast json import (@erak)
* [x] documentation (@chriseth)
* [x] test for options with overloaded functions (@chriseth) https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/526#issuecomment-577702525

Problems:

We want to parse
```
callableexpression{value:123, gas:53}(params);
```

but this also matches
```
try this.ext() { r = s; } catch (bytes memory) { r = s; }
```

i was able to work around this, checkout the last commit (parser hack).
However this hack still has a weakness. It can't parse

```
try this.fn(){value:3, salt:2}(){value:5}() {  } catch (bytes memory) {  }
```

that is, if fn returns a function and we want to call that function with call options again, it will error (but only in the try/catch case)

I can maybe hack-fix that as well, but it will be even uglier.

I am open to alternative solutions.

Are there any plans to add support for calculating contract addresses?

There was a discussion https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2136#issuecomment-559196297, but I think we forgot to follow up on it.
