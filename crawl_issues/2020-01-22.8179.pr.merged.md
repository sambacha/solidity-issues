### Description
 
Use calldatacopy to cheaply zero memory instead of codecopy.

Motiviation:
  Zero'ing memory is commonplace in contracts, but with the upcoming
  Layer-2 EVM translation layers and other on-chain verification
  mechanisms, using `codecopy` becomes a `costly` operation in those
  sandboxes. Using `calldatacopy` achieves the same thing, gas costs
  are also the same as codecopy, and is significantly cheaper in the `sandbox` situation.

So `calldatacopy` and `codecopy` can be used interchangably?

This should deserve a changelog entry.

@pinkiebell can you explain why is it cheaper in sandbox situations?

In sandbox applications or on-chain verification procedures, it is usually the case that the original contract code is only available via `extcodecopy` or otherwise via validating merkle-proofs of the contract code. If the original contract bytecode is `transformed` - modified or translated into another bytecode representation, it becomes much more expensive to serve `codecopy` operations at runtime.

Call-data is usually part of a transaction (input) for a computation and already validated before we run the bytecode and therefore is cheaper to access/validate in all those sandbox solutions - as far my knowledge goes.
