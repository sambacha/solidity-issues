Running `scripts/ASTImportTest.sh` does not display potential errors because they are being sent to `/dev/null`. Having a variable that can be set by a human (in contrast to CI) which prevents this would be beneficial.

@aarlt Since you're refactoring this script, you could take care of this while doing it.
