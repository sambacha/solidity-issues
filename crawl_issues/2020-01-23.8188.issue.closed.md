Today I stumbled with a strange scenario that I did not expect to work, yet it does: contracts that inherit from parents with a `using` statement can also use the same library in that manner.

Consider the following contracts:
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

library Lib {
    function foo(uint256 value) internal returns (uint256) {
        return value + 42;
    }
}

contract A {
    using Lib for uint256;
}

contract B is A {
    function bar(uint256 value) public returns (uint256) {
        return value.foo(); // Usage of Lib
    }
}
```

Note that `B` could even exist on a separate source file, which would make the code all that more cryptic - it's probably not very hard to introduce a backdoor using this mechanism.

Is this behavior intended, or a bug?

From the [documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.1/contracts.html#using-for):

>The `using A for B;` directive is active only within the current contract, including within all of its functions, and has no effect outside of the contract in which it is used. The directive may only be used inside a contract, not inside any of its functions.

The code explicitly traverses all contracts in the inheritance hierarchy, so it is probably not a bug. "within the current contract" does not explicitly rule out derived contracts for me, although this should certainly be clarified in the documentation.

As a regular user, I was _very_ surprised by that behavior. I'd suggest emitting a warning on such cases, and disallowing it entirely on 0.7.x.

The community feedback form showed a preference for removing inheritance for "using for", so we could include that in the 0.7.0 release.

Accepted in design call.
