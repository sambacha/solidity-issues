### Description

I noticed two small errors while reading [Solidity v0.5.0 Breaking Changes](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/050-breaking-changes.html). One can misleading the reader so I propose here a tiny fix.

### Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles correctly
- [ ] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [ ] Used meaningful commit messages
