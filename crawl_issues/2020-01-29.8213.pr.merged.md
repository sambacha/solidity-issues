### Description
Extracted from #8164.

From C++ guidelines: [C.50: Use a factory function if you need "virtual behavior" during initialization](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rc-factory)
> The return type of the factory should normally be `unique_ptr` by default; if some uses are shared, the caller can `move` the `unique_ptr` into a `shared_ptr`. However, if the factory author knows that all uses of the returned object will be shared uses, return `shared_ptr` and use `make_shared` in the body to save an allocation.

I changed `yul::Parser.parse()` to return `unique_ptr<Block>`. This way it can be converted to `shared_ptr` if necessary but the caller is not forced to do it.

The reason for this change is that `unique_ptr` is more appropriate in my `Program` class implementaion in #8164 and I don't think the reason for originally choosing `shared_ptr` for this was motivated by any special considerations. If I'm wrong, well, I could just change my implementation.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
