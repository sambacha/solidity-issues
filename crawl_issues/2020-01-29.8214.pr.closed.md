# [\#8214 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8214) `closed`: Remove VarNameCleaner from OptimiserSuite step list

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-01-29 23:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8214):

### Description
Extracted from #8164. See also discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8164#discussion_r370912339 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8164#discussion_r371360480.

`VarNameCleaner` has the same interface as the other optimisation steps but can't be arbitrarily mixed with them. This pull request removes it from the list of all steps in `OptimiserSuite` and makes it apply it manually instead.

It also makes `yulopti` rerun disambiguator afterwards to make it safe to use.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

It seems I don't have push permission to the branch :(

Yeah, looks like that's how it is with external PRs :(

Actually it's a setting: People with write-access to the target repo can push to the remote branch of the PR - somewhere either in the user or repo options :)

Oh. That's good to know. We can change it in that case.

@rodiazet you have admin rights to `imapp-pl` repos. Would you enable this option?
