# [\#8215 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8215) `merged`: Yul optimiser step abbreviations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-01-29 23:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8215):

### Description
Extracted from #8164.

This pull request adds an official list of one-letter abbreviations for all optimiser step. The list is meant for use in utilities like `yulopti` or `yul-phaser` (#7806).

It also adds a small utility function (`invertMap()`) to `CommonData.h` and updates `yulopti` to use the new abbreviations and construct its help banner automatically.

**Note**: This PR is based on #8214 for convenience because I need #8164 on top of both of them. The side effect is that the diff shows changes from both of them.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Looks like clang does not like this one. Working on it.

I give up. I'm getting get the following error in the [job output from the `continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr` check](https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity/jobs/643619992):

```
/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/libsolutil/CommonData.h:167:19: error: unused variable '' [-Werror,-Wunused-variable]

        for (auto const& [key, value]: originalMap)

                         ^
/home/travis/build/ethereum/solidity/libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp:419:47: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'solidity::util::invertMap<std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >, char>' requested here

        static map<char, string> lookupTable = util::invertMap(stepNameToAbbreviationMap());
```
But both values are in fact in use.

It does not happen with my local GCC 9.2.0 or clang 9.0.1. Neither in Debug nor Release. I can't reproduce it with [clang 5.0 on godbolt.org either](https://godbolt.org/z/uvsbSs). I tried to run the compilation in one of the docker images from the `.circleci` directory but after building it I realized that there's a separate one for clang but it's Ubuntu 19 while Travis CI seems to be running Ubuntu 14 (Trusty).

I might be able to figure this out eventually if I dug deeper and managed to reproduce it locally but I think I already spent more time on it than it's worth. I'm giving up and going back to the old version of `invertMap()` without structured bindings.

I just pushed an updated version (with fixups already squashed).

Weirdly, `soltest` is crashing for me now:
```
*********unknown location(0): fatal error: in "StandardCompiler/basic_compilation": memory access violation at address: 0x00000020: no mapping at fault address
/solidity/test/libsolidity/StandardCompiler.cpp(326): last checkpoint: "basic_compilation" test entry
*******************************************************
*** 1 failure is detected in the test module "SolidityTests"
```

I'm rebuilding clean `develop` to see if it's caused by my code.

Looks like the crash is not caused by stuff introduced in this PR. I'm investigating it but there's no reason to hold the PR back.

It crashes on clean `develop` too. Moreover no one else has confirmed experiencing it and all CI checks have passed so far (except one that's still pending). Very possible that it's just something on my system.

I found the issue and it was indeed unrelated to the PR.

> The problem disappeared after a clean rebuild from scratch so it was a false alarm.
> The stack trace was leading me down to `solidity::evmasm::GasMeter::GasConsumption::operator+=` and then internals of `boost::multiprecision::number`. Rebuilding specifically `GasMeter.cpp` made it go away. I think it was caused by stale objects being provided by `ccache` after I installed the latest Boost 1.72.0 from Arch repos during the weekend. Must remember to clear the cache after Boost updates...
