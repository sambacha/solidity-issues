Please don't remove the job itself, just remove it from the workflow.

Away from keyboard

Just wanted to say that perhaps disabling the ossfuzz build is an Overkill

Afaik, disabling the nightly circle ci job `t_ubu_ossfuzz`

Disabling `b_ubu_ossfuzz` will make potential fuzzer build failures go undetected

I agree with the lack of documentation to build fuzzer binaries locally. Afaik, there is an open issue to populate this docu
