## Abstract

Support a more readable and consistent error reporting. Whiskers came up as a reference.

Came out of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8103.

## Specification

E.g. `"Cannot use <to_string(operator)> on <type.string()>."`

I really like the idea of streamlining error reports. But if Whiskers is the right way to do that, I am not too sure.

My initial motivation was to improve readability of error messages by using semantic colouring, something that would be a convenient argument for using fmtlib (part of C++20's std::format), so that passing custom types to the error formatter could be auto-colorized & pretty-printed without additional effort on the caller side.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
