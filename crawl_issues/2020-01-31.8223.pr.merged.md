### Description
The second pull request implementing #7806.

As discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8164#discussion_r371363136 this PR makes `yul-phaser` not parse the source code from scratch every time it needs to calculate fitness of a particular optimisation step sequence. Instead it now keeps a parsed and disambiguated but still unoptimised `Program` instance make copies each time optimisations need to be applied.

The PR also contains a small, unrelated style tweak to `Program::applyOptimisationSteps()`. Now the function gets and returns a `unique_ptr` instead of passing data in and out via an argument.

Note: this PR is based on #8164 and the changes from it show through in the diff. If you want to review only the modifications from this PR, look at the top 3 commits.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Appveyor fails but the only error I can see is
```
C:\projects\solidity\tools\solidityUpgrade\SourceUpgrade.cpp(153): error C3861: 'isatty': identifier not found 
```
I see that it fails in a few other PRs too. I suspect this is broken in `develop`.
