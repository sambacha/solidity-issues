# [\#8224 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8224) `merged`: Replaced SourceLocation::isEmpty() with isValid() and hasText().

@chriseth 

The function `SourceLocation::isEmpty(`) had somewhat dual role.
Sometimes it indicates that the `SourceLocation` is invalid.
Sometimes it means that there is no corresponding source text.

Hence the proposal is to replace it with two functions, `isValid()` and `hasText()`.

I also removed `Scanner::sourceAt()`. (Do we have a rule of thumb to remove unused code?)

Since `hasText()` checks that start and end are valid indices for source, I adjusted a couple of tests to avoid empty source strings.

Ah, it turns out the json import tests are failing :(

I did not see json import failing. (I ran `soltest.exe -- --no-smt`, it succeeded.)
The issue likely is that during importing, we create `SourceLocation` with an empty source string, so `hasText()` returned `false`.

I changed `SourceLocation::hasText()` to allow an empty source. It is not ideal, now `SourceLocation::hasText()` and `SourceLocation::text()` handle an empty source differently.
Maybe `hasText()` needs to be renamed.

Maybe it would be better to make the import assertion less strict instead? Just see what makes sense for the source location struct.

Done. Both relaxing `assert` and allowing empty source string make certain sense (and both are not perfect).

A difficulty we face, IMO, is that `SourceLocation` has two distinct reincarnations:

[a] a fully-constructed object, which should be a read-only/immutable and have all the members set consistently (or perhaps may stay in an invalid null-state);

[b] a raw object under construction, where we can set `start`, `end`, `source` independently,
and where consistency checks do not necessarily apply.
