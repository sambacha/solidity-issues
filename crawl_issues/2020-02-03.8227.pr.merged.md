Unfortunately, I'm not sure there's a good way to actually test this... we might just have to keep in mind having an eye on this for the next release.

I also partially addressed https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8127 in a separate commit here, since I was touching the file anyways, but I can move that to a separate PR, if you prefer. We still need to decide how we want to deal with the leading zeros in commit hashes of past releases in any case.

> This is interesting: We publish the first commit on the release branch instead of publishing the tagged commit. This is a remnant of the time where we did not have github releases. We should change this at some point.

Wanna create an issue for that?
