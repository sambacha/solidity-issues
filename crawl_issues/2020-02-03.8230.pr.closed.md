Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8099.

Adds `scripts/docs_version_pragma_check.sh `, which aims to extract the minimal version from the pragma in documentation examples. This extracted version is then used to download that specific static linux binary from the release page and to compile the example.

Could be run as part of our nightly pipeline.

It shares some code with example extraction in place, and these changes are also included.

#### TODO
- [x] Change script, such that it extracts the minimal compiler version from each example
- [ ] Change all documentation examples which do not compile. These will be at least the ones mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8099

I've found a solution that worked with most of the examples and also changed them accordingly. I'd say, that I've managed to change 90% of all examples (so just some left). Unfortunately, I forgot to push them and now they're sitting on another laptop that I can only get back to next weekend.

Conclusion: after I've pushed my changes, someone else could easily pick this up.
