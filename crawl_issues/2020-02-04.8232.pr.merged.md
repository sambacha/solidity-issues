# [\#8232 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8232) `merged`: Add support for reading standard-json from file

Currently `--standard-json` only supports reading input from `stdin`, reading input from a specified file may simplify debugging.

In which circumstance couldn't you use `solc --standard-json < inputfile.json`?

Sure, but I wanted to use an IDE for debugging. I'm using right now CLion and there it is only possible to supply `Program arguments`. Probably there are other ways, but `solc --standard-json < inputfile.json` did not work. For me it was just easier to just enable the definition of input files. From my point of view it just simplifies debugging.

I was now also wondering how this may work with e.g. `gdb`. I just did a very superficial look, but it seem to be a bit ugly. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13104206/how-to-debug-a-program-that-takes-user-input-from-stdin-with-gdb#13131964

Added it to the discussion queue.

Discussion: Allow input via file and stdin, but output only to stdout.
