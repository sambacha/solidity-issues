Closes #8128 
Am I missing something? This is basically it, isn't it? I'm not sure why this was assigned 5 points...

Please also implement getter functions.

I also added a last commit with some Yul IR code generation for mapping getters, but I'm not sure about it and we might want to postpone that part and remove it from this PR...

Does it make sense to squash?
