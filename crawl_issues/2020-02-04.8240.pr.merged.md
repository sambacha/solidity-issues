Rebased and it is still not working. Maybe we overlooked some optimizer step?

@chriseth It seems to be working now. Was anything fixed in the optimizer that could have "fixed" it here?

@leonardoalt no, it's not. It generates code `(call $eth.storageStore (i64.const 0) (i64.const 32))`, but `$eth.storageStore` requires `i32` arguments.

Or did you rebase and check?

Rebasing did not help.

Just for reference, some context for this PR I got from @chriseth 
> the type system for yul was only implemented recently. Becuse wasm is typed, I added a hack that injected the necessary type conversion functions at a very late stage. After the type system has been implemented, I hoped I could remove that type injection code again, but the example shows that the types are wrong somehow.

This appears to be the commit that adds the hack: 8337de51893871de7a7868c29d7d3c8219bd6f23 (#7600).

I dug into this and as explained in the [comment above](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8240#discussion_r374964041) the immediate problem is that literals are hard-coded to 64 bits. But that's not all. Variables don't have types either:

``` c++
struct VariableDeclaration { std::string variableName; };
struct GlobalVariableDeclaration { std::string variableName; };
```

I pushed an experimental commit with support for `i32` literals. This fixes the particular problem @chriseth pointed out but variables are still a problem. Lack of `i32` variables means that parameters and results are `i64` too. So this is broken too:

``` wasm
(call $eth.revert (call $to_internal_i32ptr ...
```

because `$to_internal_i32ptr` still translates to a function that actually returns `i64`:
``` wasm
(func $to_internal_i32ptr
    (param $x1 i64)
    (param $x2 i64)
    (param $x3 i64)
    (param $x4 i64)
    (result i64)
    ...
```
The `i32`/`i64` parameter types in Yul AST are simply ignored during translation to wasm AST because they cannot be represented in it.

Adding types to variables seemed straightforward so I started working on it as well but I ran into some problems. E.g. Yul `switch` translates to a variable and a bunch of `if`s in wasm but the expression associated with the switch has no type in Yul AST so we don't know which type to choose for the variable.

In the end I decided to stop at literals for now and wait for feedback.

You can use `TypeInfo` for keeping track of types of expressions. See how it is used in `ExpressionSplitter`.

OK. I'll check it out.

Can you bring the literals part into a mergeable state (I think you cannot remove the "inject conversion" part yet)?

I can but this won't really work without removing the conversion hack. You'll get stuff like `i32.wrap_i64 (i32.const 0)`.

@chriseth Oh, and if you meant the `[EXPERIMENTAL]` in the commit description, it's mostly because I haven't tested it except for visually inspecting the generated code in existing tests.

And because I wasn't sure if I need an overload of `lebEncodeSigned()` for 32-bit ints. The 64-bit version looks at a glance like it should handle both but I didn't analyze it too deeply yet.

I'll take care of these two things now.

OK, nice! I think you can skip tests for now, we don't really have tests in this area of the code and will later add tests via hera #8016 - they should do it then.

`lebEncodeSigned()` seems fine for `i32` since it skips all higher bytes that are zero anyway. So that's all for literals then.

Still, I don't think it makes sense to merge this yet because the code being generated is broken:
```wasm
(call $eth.revert (call $to_internal_i32ptr ...
```
`$eth.revert()` accepts `i32` but `$to_internal_i32ptr()` returns `i64`. We need to be able to have `i32` for parameters and return values to be able to remove the hack safely.

I just rebased on `develop` and pushed a commit that adds support for `i32` vars and params. I think everything is implemented and what's left is basically cleanup and making sure I did not break anything in the process but I still consider it a draft:
- Types in the AST are still stored as `YulString` because that's what I started out with. I need to change that.
- I can extract some bits into smaller refactoring PRs.
- I need to take another look at my changes and see if anything can be simplified to save you time in review.
- I need to review the commandline test output to make sure types match.
- Would be nice to somehow make sure that binary output is valid too. The way locals are defined is now a bit more complex.

This is now ready for review. I extracted some of my changes into #9142 to make reviewing easier.

I tested generated wasm (both text and binary) by passing it through wabt (`wasm2wat`/`wat2wasm`). Initially I found some problems (I was actually using `lebEncodeSigned()` incorrectly for `i32`; also #9140 and #9141) but now it all passes their validations without problems.

I updated the PR to match changes in PRs below it and it's now ready for another round of review. Those changes were just refactors so they did not affect generated Wasm code included in tests.
