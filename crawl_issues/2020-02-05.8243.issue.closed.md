If the dialect has a bool type, convert `if c { ... }` to `if c { c := true ... }` in the conditional simplifier and similar for `for` loops and maybe other things.

This might be obsolete when we use z3 in the optimizer.

@chriseth Is this still worth implementing?

Currently, this is not too helpful anyway, because we do not use bools in our code generator. I'm moving it to the icebox.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
