# [\#8246 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8246) `merged`: Sol-to-Yul codegen for try-catch statement

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2020-02-05 12:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8246):

~~I *think* I'm done.~~

## Checklist:
* [x] simple try/catch statements
* [x] return data handling
* [x] `nested.sol` FIX
* [x] `structured.sol`: FIX internal compiler error "Invalid variable kind"
* [x] `structuredAndLowLevel.sol`: same as `structured.sol`
* [x] `returns_function.sol`
* [x] `assert.sol`
* [x] `trivial.sol`

## Tests that cannot be enabled:
* [ ] `create.sol`: requires constructors with parameters (Ticket: #8350)
* [ ] `invalid_error_encoding.sol`: some other bug?

## Tasks that can possibly be factored out into own PRs:
* [x] Move `IRGeneratorForStatements::verifyTrySuccessClause` logic into TypeChecker (so old codegen benefits from it, too)

Did you implement all the ways to catch and decode return variables or just the simple "catch"?

@chriseth As far as I understand, the following procedure had to be implemented

* `<call>(...)` the function whose result on the stack is indicating whether or not a throw(/revert) has happened.
* if `iszero(result) == 0` then nothing was thrown and the success case is executed
* otherwise an exception was thrown:
  * the message is being decoded (code copy'n'pasted from old code, and adapted a little)
  * if `iszero(decodedData) != 0` -> decoding succeed, and the structured catch clause is invoked (basically also copy'n'paste)
  * otherwise, if fallback is present, this one will be called
  * otherwise, message is being re-thrown.

So I guess the most interesting functions are
* handleCatch in line 1696, and
* handleCatchFallback in line 1769.

I *think* this is all the cases to care for.

Tests are failing.

What's actually the current state of this? Does it still depend on any other PR? It needs a rebase in any case.

Please rebase properly.

@chriseth I've applied your change requests and rebased on top of latest develop branch.

Actually I'm wondering now if we could pack the whole `appendExternalFunctionCall` into a yul funciton...

Removed the initializers, rebased and squashed.
