**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`, `natspec`

Follow-up of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7835

The goal is that docstring elements can have their own source locations.

I think this is a good idea. Currently, the `docStringParser` is too complicated I think. One problem I see is how `\n` is used as a line break and also to indicate end of a tag. For example, for the following contract.

```solidity
contract C {
	/// @notice this is a function that has a long notice tag so that we have to
	/// wrap the line.
	/// @param x integer
	function f(int x) public {

	}
}
```

The "StructuredDocumentation", "text" attribute is `text": "@notice this is a function that has a long notice tag so that we have to\n wrap the line.\n @param x integer"`. We could simplify the `docStringParser` if the main parser can separate the text at the beginning.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
