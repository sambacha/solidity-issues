# [\#8251 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8251) `merged`: Refactor currentlocation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-02-05 23:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8251):

Replaced `ParserBase::position()` and `ParserBase::endPosition()` with `ParserBase::currentLocation()`.

It might be simpler to pass `SourceLocation` object instead of splitting it into `start` and `end`, and creating another SourceLocation object using the same `start` and `end` later.

Hmm, `bcca09f` fixes **continuous-integration/appveyor/pr**, but now **continuous-integration/travis-ci/pr** is failing.

Is it really related?

To fix **appveyor**, I just copy-pasted

```
#ifdef _WIN32 // windows
	#include <io.h>
	#define isatty _isatty
	#define fileno _fileno
#else // unix
	#include <unistd.h>
#endif
```

from `CommandLineInterface.cpp`. Is it the right way?

Removed the last commit because the failure is unrelated to this PR.
