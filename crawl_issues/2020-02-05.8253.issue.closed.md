From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8178/, many reverts added to the code are never triggered by our tests. We should try to reach all of them.
They can be found via `// TODO add test` in `codegen/*`.

There are still plenty of such TODOs:
```
./CompilerUtils.cpp:					// TODO add test
./CompilerUtils.cpp:					// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:			// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:					// TODO add revert test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:		// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:		// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:		// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:		// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:			// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:				// TODO add test
./ABIFunctions.cpp:				// TODO add test
```

Not sure if there are tests for them, but we should add them so we can see difference in behaviour for the IR.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
