# [\#8256 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8256) `closed`: [WIP][yul-phaser] Genetic algorithm

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-02-06 09:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8256):

### Description
The third pull request implementing #7806. This PR depends on #8223.

#### Algorithm
This pull request adds an actual genetic algorithm to `yul-phaser`. It's the algorithm proposed in the initial e-mails with only slight differences:
> - initialize the pool with 20 chromosomes of random length between 12 and 30, their contents fully random from the set of operations (including repetitions).
> - evaluate them by running them in a loop of maybe 5 iterations on the example input set (we should talk about that, too, but probably those in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite are fine for now)
> - sort by fitness, discard the lower half
> - re-fill one fourth by randomly selecting some chromosomes and exchanging random genes by other genes (mutation)
> - re-fill the last fourth by randomly selecting pairs of chromosomes and exchanging their genes at random cut points (cross-over)

The only difference is that the mutations performed by the current implementation include also random deletion and addition of genes, not just replacement. For each chromosome that undergoes mutation there's a 90% chance that the mutation is a gene replacement, 5% chance that it's a deletion and 5% chance that it's an addition. In each case every gene in the chromosome has a 10% chance of being affected by the mutation.

#### Implementation details
1. `GeneticAlgorithm` is a base class for concrete algorithm implementations. There are currently two: 
    - `RandomAlgorithm` (the same random algorithm that was used until now)
    - `GenerationalElitistWithExclusivePools` (the new algorithm).
    
    They can be selected on the command line using the `--algorithm` option. Valid values are: `random` and `GEWEP` (default).
2. There are a few new building blocks meant to make it easy to put together custom algorithms:
    - **Fitness metrics** - classes derived from `FitnessMetric`. For example `ProgramSize` metric stores a `Program` instance and computes the final size given a chromosome.
    - **Mutation and crossover operators** - functors that accept and return, a chromosome or a pair of chromosomes. They can be applied to a selection of chromosomes from a given population. Multiple simpler operators can be joined into more complex mutations using `alternativeMutations()` and in the future probably other combining operators.
    - **Selections and pair selections**: classes derived from `Selection` and `PairSelection`. They generate a set of indices (or pairs of indices) of population members according to specific rules. 
        - `RandomSelection` can choose a specific proportion of individuals at random. 
        - `RandomPairSelection` selects pairs of different chromosomes at random.
        - `RangeSelection` can select a sequence of individuals from a sorted population (e.g. invididuals classified between top 10% and bottom 20% of the population).
    - **Populations**: instances of the `Population` class. The class is now an immutable container for chromosomes associated with a particular fitness metrics. It no longer provides methods for running rounds of the algorithm (it's now `GeneticAlgorithm`'s job). Instead it has methods for generating new populations matching a selection and (optionally) modified by a mutation or crossover operator.
        - Populations are now always kept ordered by fitness. Fitness is no longer an optional part of `Individual` and is computed as soon as a chromosome is inserted.
    - **Chromosomes**: instances of `Chromosome` representing sequences of optimisation steps. This one did not change much in this PR.

#### Additional features
- `ProgramSize` metric can apply an optimisation sequence repeatedly specified number of times. The number is hard-coded to 5 right now.
- The random algorithm now preserves only the single best chromosome in each round.

#### Running the program
``` bash
cd build/
make yul-phaser
tools/yul-phaser ../test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/abi_example1.yul --algorithm GEWEP
```

### PR status
This PR still needs some polishing but is ready for an initial round of review. Please just keep in mind that some stuff might not yet be as polished as it should be and can still change a bit. The algorithm is already functional and just needs some tweaking.

Stuff remaining before I can change it from draft to a final PR:
- [ ] Add tests for all the new code (for now I just updated the existing ones).
- [ ] Add/update class docstrings.
- [ ] Clean up the `[TMP]` commits.
- [ ] Some small tweaks here and there.

Stuff that'll probably be done in separate PRs:
- [ ] Make mutations more aggressive or tweak some other parameters to prevent a bunch of duplicates ending up at the top. Right now there are often multiple copies of the same chromosome because the set of candidates for crossover is pretty small.
- [ ] Selections that can be iterated to generate numbers on the fly instead of storing them in a vector.
- [ ] Make selections work as `Population` iterators. Currently they only know population size and generate indices based on that. Having them associated with a specific population would allow doing stuff like skipping duplicates.
- [ ] Add command-line options for some of the algorithm parameters that are currently hard-coded in `main.cpp`.
- [ ] Change internal representation of `Chromosome` from a vector of strings to a string of step abbreviations.
- [ ] Templated metrics that could return values other than `size_t`. For example returning a tuple containing program size and size of the chromosome would allow us prioritize shorter chromosomes that give the same results.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Some comments on the general algorithm:
 - I feel that replacing 10% of the genes on average in mutation is too much.
 - crossover: I think a single-point crossover is too simple, but we can keep it for now. Is it essential that the operation returns a pair of chromosomes? Would it be simpler to just return a single one instead?

> - I feel that replacing 10% of the genes on average in mutation is too much.

Yeah, it does change pretty fast, but it eventually converges to a set of identical chromosomes when I run it long enough. But that's because it's too easy to get duplicates with the current crossover on a small population. I'm going to experiment with a few crossover methods later anyway. But for now I'll just change this (and other things you point out if you find anything else).

> crossover: I think a single-point crossover is too simple, but we can keep it for now.

It probably is. For now I just wanted to try the method you suggested in your initial e-mail. Later I'll try other methods. I found two papers that compare various operators. Maybe they'll be helpful in choosing a better operator. If not, I'll just find out empirically.
- [A Comparative Study of Adaptive Crossover Operators for Genetic Algorithms to Resolve the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3097)
- [CROSSOVER OPERATORS IN GENETIC ALGORITHMS: A REVIEW](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288749263_CROSSOVER_OPERATORS_IN_GENETIC_ALGORITHMS_A_REVIEW)

> Is it essential that the operation returns a pair of chromosomes? Would it be simpler to just return a single one instead?

Not essential at all. Actually I initially wanted to do the simpler one but changed it. It's one of those details you don't think about until you have to actually implement it :) When I skimmed through those papers above I realized that they treat crossover as returning a pair so I decided to do it "by the book". But yeah, it would be simpler if it just generated a new chromosome from two inputs. I'll change it to work that way. I don't think it will have any negative consequences and it's not hard to change back anyway.

I have the final version of this PR ready but it grew so much after the addition of tests, docs and some tweaks that I decided to split it into a few smaller ones. This should make review easier as the smaller PRs are self-contained and gradually introduce new features:
- #8324
- #8325
- #8326
- #8327
- #8328

So I'm closing this one. The two remarks above have been addressed in the last one of those smaller PRs.
