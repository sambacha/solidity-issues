# [\#8257 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8257) `merged`: Introduce IRVariable's for full IR tuple support.

I think this is done now - it's some major refactoring, but it should be straightforward to review step by step and I think it's worth it.

For reference: at the time of writing this is Yul IR for ERC20 generated on develop:
https://gist.github.com/ekpyron/5365a2381f669a1952dab5d7a24cb4e3

And this is Yul IR generated by this PR (rebased on top of the same commit on develop):
https://gist.github.com/ekpyron/4e4972007765beddabdcb49685b2e3e6

This is the diff between the two:
https://gist.github.com/ekpyron/0e9ccd93c1976d1b35e13f4fd732e737

The version generated from this PR tends to create a few more local variables, but I would have expected that, that's the price for a little bit less headache regarding conversions when writing IR generation code... and I checked the optimized IR output and it remains identical.
