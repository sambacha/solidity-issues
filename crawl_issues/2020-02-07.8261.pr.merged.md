# [\#8261 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8261) `merged`: Fix printing source for missing pragma.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-02-07 01:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8261):

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8020

To prevent displaying source, we could:

[a] check if `[start, end)` spans over the entire file;
[b] mark `SourceLocation` to indicating that the location is the file itself, not any of its fragment.

### [a]
The option [a] does not look ideal. Consider a file containing a (misformatted) pragma only:

```
pragma solidity <;
```

`[start, end)` spans over the entire file, but perhaps we still want to print the source.

### [b]
For [b], IMO, it might be better to associate the whole-file-location with concrete warning rather than with a node (`SourceUnit`). (It is what this PR suggests.)

A disadvantage here is that we cannot really use `start` and `end` anymore, directly or indirectly (e.g with `SourceLocation::contains()` or `..::intersects()`).

Another pragmatic approach would be just to include the file name to the error message in `SyntaxChecker::endVisit(SourceUnit)` and omit the location all together. But it does not look elegant either.
