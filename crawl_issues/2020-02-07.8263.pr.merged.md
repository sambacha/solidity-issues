One thing you could also fix here is the following:
```
interface Banana {
    function transfer(address,uint256) external returns(bool);
}

contract Apple {
    function f() public {
        Banana.transfer;
    }
}
```

It results in an internal error with "unsupported member function" in ExpressionCompiler.

Fixed that one as well here. Do you think this needs a changelog entry?

Does this close https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8262 ?

Yeah... I think this makes more sense now.
I was wondering whether there's any functions accessed via contract name that *shouldn't* be pure, but even base functions should be fine - function calls to them should still derive their pureness from their mutability, which should be fine...

It would be great if we could take some time and see if we can use `using x for y` to trick this mechanism. We should also check if something like `super.f` or `C.f` where `f` is a state variable of function type could be used here.

And finally, `f.selector` where `f` is a local variable of function type.

You're right, state variables in base contracts can in fact sneak around the current mechanism, I'll try to fix.

I wonder whether this can generally be done in a better way... I think the latest version kind of works, but it still won't allow ``(this).f.selector`` without reason... let alone ``(true ? this : this).f.selector``...

Argh, this is also missing a changelog entry :(

I'll also add a changelog entry.

Damn, too late :-).
