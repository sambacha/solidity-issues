Let's see what happens...

Travis pushed everything correctly to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-test-bytecode/tree/master/2020-02-07-73bc433b8c46c56bd46b193ae481ceac7a597897 now with a matching sha512 hash of the report, but https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ethereum-free/solidity/builds/30647484 remains queued at the time of writing. If that ends up pushing to the same directory and - given the python script change for the line endings - produces the same hash, then this PR should be fine.

EDIT: yes all seems fine!

Still WIP?

Nope, this works and is theoretically done - but @chriseth doesn't want it and wants to instead have the bytecode comparisons *also* disabled for the appveyor runs on PRs :-).

I want this to run all on circleci only at some point in the future.

I repurposed this for disabling the bytecode upload on appveyor runs on PRs.
I'm rather blindly editing the appveyor script, though, so we should verify that it does in fact *not* push bytecode in https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ethereum-free/solidity/builds/30789276 and - if we merge - that it *does* upload bytecode on the merge to develop.

Ok the test run in this PR looks good, so as far as I'm concerned we can merge this and then check the runs on develop.
