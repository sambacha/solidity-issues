# [\#8267 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8267) `merged`: [Yul] Prune functions that call each other but are otherwise unreferenced

Fixes #7352

I was not completely sure about when to run this optimization stage in `Suite.cpp` so I tried add it to the sequences where `UnusedPruner` is run.

I also couldn't find a way to test the case of a function that is called from other externally called functions.
```
{
    function f() -> x { x := g() }
    function g() -> x { x := f() }
}
```
In the above example, if the function `f` is externally referenced, the functions `f` and `g` should not be pruned, otherwise they should be. Is it possible to add such a test?

Looks good! Please add a changelog entry and squash.
