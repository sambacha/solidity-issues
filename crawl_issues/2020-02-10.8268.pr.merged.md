# [\#8268 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8268) `merged`: Avoided trailing '\r' in CharStream::lineAtPosition().

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-02-10 00:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8268):

While making **cmdlineTests.sh** work on Wndows, I noticed that a couple of tests produce slightly different results.


#### test/cmdlineTests/too_long_line_multiline/err
Expected:
```
2 |     function f() returns (byte _b, byte ... _b7, bytes22 _b22, bytes32 _b32)  {
```
Got (missing `_` in front of `b7`):
```
2 |     function f() returns (byte _b, byte ... b7, bytes22 _b22, bytes32 _b32)  {
```

#### test/cmdlineTests/too_long_line_edge_in/err
Expected:
```
2 |    function ffffffffffffffffffffff(announcementTypeTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT Ty, string A) onlyOwner external {
```
Got (`...` at the end):
```
2 |    function ffffffffffffffffffffff(announcementTypeTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT Ty, string A) onlyOwner external { ...
```

The cause seems to be that `CharStream::lineAtPosition` did not remove trailing `\r` (from `\r\n` line ending).
