Unfortunately, this is impossible to review :(
As you mentioned, you wrote a tool to help you in this process. Can you publish that tool, so we can verify the tool instead?

@chriseth Yes, I have the same opinion. It is quite difficult to review. The tool that I wrote is really hacky and manual changes are needed for the most resulting test-files. However, the tool can be found here https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/tree/end2end-test-extraction/test/tools/end2end-extractor but I think because of the needed manual changes it make probably no sense to verify this tool - at least in the current state. I'm not sure whether it is really possible to extracts those tests automatically in a way that no additional manual changes are needed.

What I was thinking right now, probably it may help a lot to just put the original source of the different boost test-cases as comments on top of the resulting test-files. With this we can easily compare the test itself with the original boost test-case. What do you think?

I also needed to do some changes to `test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` to allow the extractor to work. Basically there is a define ` END_TO_END_EXTRACTOR` that prevents the inclusion of the normal headers. And I needed to add an additional `};` at the end of each test-case, because those `BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE` defintions will become lambda functions. The normal boost-test macros are redefined inside the extractor.
