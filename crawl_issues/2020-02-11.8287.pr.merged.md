To be honest, mingw looks like a very broken system to me and I'm not sure we should introduce these complications especially given the fact that we have no CI run on mingw.

mingw-w64 is actually quite nice (I've been using it for windows development myself in the past) and I think some support might actually be nice - but I'm not too happy about adding workarounds like semicolons in remapping paths for it either... maybe there's a better way, though.
