# [\#8289 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8289) `merged`: Switch nightly fuzzer build from ASan (slow) to UBSan (fast)

Fixes #8219 

Notes:

- Main reason for timeout was run time overhead of Address sanitizer (ASan)
- Since we have ASan CIs already (t_ubu_asan*), this PR switches to undefined sanitizer (UBSan)
- UBSan detects type errors such as integer overflow
- UBSan is a smaller run time overhead than ASan, the hope is that nightly runs complete sooner
- With this switch, we won't detect memory errors in nightly runs but the following error classes
  - Type errors
  - ICE
  - Any uncaught exception in solidity
- Corpus has not been altered, this means each nightly run will run nightly UBSan build against existing fuzzer corpus

@chriseth This PR is still WIP. How do I test it in a nightly environment? Afaiu, only develop builds are picked up for fuzzer nightly?

Merging so it can be tested.
