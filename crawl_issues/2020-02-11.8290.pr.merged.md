### Description

I made a tiny change to the solidity docs. I added a note about limiting gas stipends in `staticcalls` (`staticcall.gas(gasLimit)`). I think the docs should mention "gas counting" here and how it can affect reading state from `view functions` that make use of `staticcall.gas(gasLimit)`, even if you only call that read-only function from a Javascript API.

I myself was not fully aware of this until I found this to be the case when testing my own code. Some other solidity developers I talked to also were not aware of the importance of `gas counting` when reading state from Ethereum from a Javascript API. The more common misconceived oversimplification seems to be that gas does not matter for state reads because they do not cost gas.
