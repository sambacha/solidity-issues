Only for the types int, uint and bytes. More can easily be added.

I think we should rather test that the contract has the signature or not. We can allow a specific keyword for the 1-2 tests that call non-existing functions.

I am not against testing against the contract, but that requires a lot more work while this is very little work but already has a huge pay off, so I wouldn't see it as "either or"
