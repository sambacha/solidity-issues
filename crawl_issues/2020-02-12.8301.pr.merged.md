@Marenz @chriseth Was there any reason to build this like this that I'm not aware of? The design made it impossible for the individual checkers to control visiting their subnodes...

There was no specific reason, I just kind of accepted that draw-back and apparently the reviewer did as well ;) 

Your code looks smaller and after reading it, I guess I just didn't completely use/understand the visitor pattern as you applied it here

@chriseth was sceptical about having full visits for the separate checkers and indeed it would kind of defeat the gain in having a compound ``PostTypeChecker``... I added a second commit that reverts the same one and just moves the assertion in the check to account for function type state variables - for the purpose of fixing the bug, that works just as well...
