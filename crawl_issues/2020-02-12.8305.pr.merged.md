Would it make sense to first have a PR that introduces the skeleton of the new mutator, and then another PR with the large chunk?

Not really necessary I guess, can review the files separately, will just take a bit longer.

@bshastry looks like this is still missing some adjustments?

Sorry @leonardoalt got a bit side tracked with the other fuzzer. Will do one final pass over your unresolved review comments once again and post an update.

No worries, just wanted to ping ;)

Just wondering: is this actually meant to be reviewed like this :-)? 110 comments, 16 commits and 2,662 added lines is kind of intimidating ;-)...

Indeed, and having commit titles like "WIP" doesn't add more trust in "this is review ready" ;)

Fully agree with the observations in this thread. When I started working on this PR, I realised certain mutations were better than others (in that they found bugs that would otherwise not be found). However, I quickly realised that I had prioritised bug finding ability over reviewability.

Now, I am in the process of isolating mutations that are meaningful and removing those that are not. I think it is better that make this PR (framework for adding custom mutations only) and postpone the actual mutations to another PR once I've had time to actually measure the effectiveness of mutations.

tl;dr: Made PR shorter and hopefully more reviewer friendly

Will update PR shortly

Updated PR: Please note that this PR contains a single mutation routine that make use of helper functions. More mutations will be added in separate PRs.

> Much better to review it now :)

Agree. I should have done it when you first suggested it! Will keep my future PRs leaner :)
