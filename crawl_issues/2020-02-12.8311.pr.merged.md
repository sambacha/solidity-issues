**tl;dr**
This PR changes the encoding in a way that is necessary for function calls, without implementing function calls just yet.
This PR is the longest in this chain, as implementing internal function calls after this one is easy.
I tried to keep at least some commits separated, but let me know if it's still too hard to review.

**Details:**

The current encoding is very similar to a contract's CFG, with the extra interface and error blocks.
As a small example, the following program would roughly have the presented encoding:
```
contract C {
    uint a;
    function f(uint x) public { assert(x > a); }
    function g(uint y) public { assert(y > a); }
}
```

```
true -> constructor
constructor -> interface(a)
interface(a) -> f_entry(a, x)
f_entry(a, x) -> f_assert(a, x)
f_assert(a, x) && !condition -> error_f
f_assert(a, x) && condition -> f_exit(a, x)
f_exit(a, x) -> interface
interface(a) -> g_entry(a, y)
... similar to f
```
We then query `error_f` and `error_g`.

However, this doesn't work for function calls, since we would either need to inline the whole CFG of the called function for every call, or we can't have more than one call to the same function, since we wouldn't know where to go back to.

The new encoding uses function summaries and nonlinear Horn clauses for that, where the function is encoded separately and "called" by the interface. Assertions do not create a new error block, they simply exit the current function with error. For that, a new error flag present in all predicates is added, where `error = 0` means no error, and `error > 0` means error where the value of `error` is the id of the failed assertion.

Besides the error flag, the main difference is the function summary predicate: It tells how a function behaves with respect to the contract state variables and function output variables in a summarized way:
`h_summary(error, s_0, s_1, in_0, in_1, out_0)`
This means that function `h` starts with state `s_0` and input `in_0`, and at the end of its execution state is `s_1` and it returns `out_1`.
`s_0` and `in_0` are simply passed from predicate to predicate unchanged so we know at any time how the execution started.

The program above would be roughly encoded as:

```
1. true -> genesis
2. genesis -> constructor_C(0)
3. constructor_C(error) && error == 0 -> interface(a)
4. genesis && a_0 == a_1 && x_0 == x_1 -> f_entry(0, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1)
5. f_entry(error, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1) && !(x_1 > a_1)  -> f_summary(1, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1)
6. f_entry(error, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1) -> f_exit(error, a_1, x_1)
7. f_exit(error, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1) -> f_summary(error, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1)
8. interface(a_0) && f_summary(error, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1) && error == 0 -> interface(a_1)
9. interface(a_0) && f_summary(error, a_0, a_1, x_0, x_1) && error == 1 -> error_assertion_1
...similar for g...
```

We then query `error_assertion_1` and `error_assertion_2` (from `g`) separately.

Note that internal functions do not generate interface rules 8 and 9.
Also note that in rule 6, we do **not** add the assertion condition as a constraint in the function's path forward, so that we can still catch further assertion failures.

The changes made here should not change the results or support, but nonlinear Horn clauses make the system harder to solve, so we get some new false positives.

Hm, this *looks* good now, but unfortunately we have to figure out where these memory corruptions are coming from...

I don't have anything in mind re function pointers. I tend to give it very low priority since the easy way for us is not possible since Z3 doesn't allow functions as arguments (well, first order), and I don't think a lot of people use it. But if you have a proposal that works we should implement it.

Do you have an issue for it (re function pointers)? I didn't see one... I think it should work to just have an additional "internal dispatch" predicate for each function signature, which just takes an additional integer as argument which selects the particular internal function of that signature to be called (or the selector for external calls) - then you can just treat internal function pointers as integers (and external ones probably as pair of address and selector) and don't need actual functions as arguments and it should be fine even with Z3. If we have an issue for it, I can elaborate a bit more.
