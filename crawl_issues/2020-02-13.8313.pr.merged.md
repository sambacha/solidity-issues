But maybe (independently of this PR) we should have a general discussion about whether to generally *always* make type errors fatal, whenever you cannot reasonably assign types to all expressions and document that somewhere...

Especially, since in the long term and considering stuff like error recovery we might want to deal with all these cases more gracefully...

Alternatively we could adopt something like an "ErrorType" used in places where the code was supposed to assign a type but errored (and similar dummy constructs)

Yeah... the problem with that is that we'd probably need special cases for the error type all over... at least that *could* happen and wouldn't be nice...

This is missing a changelog entry.

Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8316 so that we do not forget it.
