I saw the following in recent appveyor runs on develop:
```
scripts\bytecodecompare\storebytecode.bat : warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in 2020-02-14-2917cf4bbccad116463e94b5b7ba7e7099af4386/windows.txt.
At line:1 char:71

+                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (warning: CRLF w...86/windows.txt.:String) [], RemoteException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError
 
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory
```
That should be fixed by forcing the python script to generate LF line endings for the bytecode reports.

(This was part of my old PR that created hashes of the report, but I removed it, since I didn't think it was still necessary, but apparently it still helps)
