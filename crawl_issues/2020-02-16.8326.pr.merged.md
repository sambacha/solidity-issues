# [\#8326 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8326) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Fitness metrics

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-02-16 00:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8326):

### Description
The fifth pull request implementing #7806. Originally a part of #8256 which is now closed. Depends on #8325.

This PR introduces the `FitnessMetric` class and makes `Population` independent of the `Program` (it can now work with any metric). A specific metric called `ProgramSize` now takes over the task of calculating the resulting program size.

`Population` now evaluates chromosomes as soon as they are added/produced and keeps them sorted at all times.

`ProgramSize` metric can apply the optimisations from a `Chromosome` multiple times. The application now applies them 5 times.

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8325. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

I just pushed a new version rebased on `develop`. The only change is a small fix for the failing CI checks (`t_osx_soltest` and `t_ubu_clang_soltest`). I had a bug in `Population` constructor that was causing a test failure but only when compiled with clang:
```
memory access violation at address: 0x00000000: no mapping at fault address
```
This was due to undefined behavior: I was moving `_fitnessMetric` into a parameter but at the same time passing `*_fitnessMetric` into another parameter. This could work or not depending on the order in which the parameters were evaluated.
``` c++
... : Population(
	std::move(_fitnessMetric),
	chromosomesToIndividuals(*_fitnessMetric, std::move(_chromosomes))
) {}
```
The simplest way to solve this was to postpone initialization of `m_individuals` until we can be certain that the metric has already been moved:
``` c++
... : Population(std::move(_fitnessMetric), std::vector<Individual>{})
{
	m_individuals = sortIndividuals(chromosomesToIndividuals(*m_fitnessMetric, std::move(_chromosomes)));
}
```

Looks good apart from the two comments!
