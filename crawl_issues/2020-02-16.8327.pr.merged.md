# [\#8327 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8327) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Random algorithm

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-02-16 00:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8327):

### Description
The sixth pull request implementing #7806. Originally a part of #8256 which is now closed. Depends on #8326.

This PR introduces the `GeneticAlgorithm` class which is the mechanism that replaces the `doSelection()` and `doMutation()` methods in `Population`. The randomized algorithm has been reimplemented as `RandomAlgorithm` and has gained a few configurable parameters.

`Population` is now just an immutable container for `Chromosome`s.

Another feature is the `Selection` class and its specializations (`RangeSelection`, `MosaicSelection` and `RandomSelection`). These are meant to be used with `Population::select()` (and in the next PR (#8328) also `mutate()` and `crossover()`) to choose subsets of individuals for specific parts of the algorithm to work with.

Finally the application now runs `RandomAlgorithm` with the size of the `Population` increased to 20 and only one individual being preserved in each round.

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8326. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
