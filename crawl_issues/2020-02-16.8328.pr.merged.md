### Description
The seventh pull request implementing #7806. Originally a part of #8256 which is now closed. Depends on #8327.

This PR introduces mutations and crossover and adds a real genetic algorithm that uses them. The algorithm isn't anything special and I don't think it has any specific name in the literature so I gave it a descriptive name based on its properties: `GenerationalElitistWithExclusivePools` or just GEWEP in short.

Mutations and crossover are implemented as functions that take one or two chromosomes, respectively, as input and produce a new chromosome (this has been changed from two, as requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8256#issuecomment-582887820). I implemented a few simple ones as needed by the new algorithm. More will come later when I'm experimenting with algorithm tweaks.

Mutations and crossover operators can be used with the new methods added to `Population`: `mutate()` and `crossover()`. To make the crossover work this way I needed to extend the selection mechanism to pairs and so `PairSelection` and its specializations were born.

The application has gained `--algorithm` option which can be used to select between GEWEP and the random algorithm. GEWEP is now the default.

As requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8256#issuecomment-582909159 I lowered the mutation chance (to 1 / 30). This does seem to make the algorithm converge faster to better sequences. Probably because it has the chance to consider more variations of the best chromosomes.

#### Algorithm
`yul-phaser` now has the algorithm proposed in the initial e-mails with only slight differences:
> - initialize the pool with 20 chromosomes of random length between 12 and 30, their contents fully random from the set of operations (including repetitions).
> - evaluate them by running them in a loop of maybe 5 iterations on the example input set (we should talk about that, too, but probably those in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite are fine for now)
> - sort by fitness, discard the lower half
> - re-fill one fourth by randomly selecting some chromosomes and exchanging random genes by other genes (mutation)
> - re-fill the last fourth by randomly selecting pairs of chromosomes and exchanging their genes at random cut points (cross-over)

The only difference is that the mutations performed by the current implementation include also random deletion and addition of genes, not just replacement. For each chromosome that undergoes mutation there's a 90% chance that the mutation is a gene replacement, 5% chance that it's a deletion and 5% chance that it's an addition. In each case every gene in the chromosome has a 3.33% chance of being affected by the mutation.

#### Running the program
``` bash
cd build/
make yul-phaser
tools/yul-phaser ../test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/abi_example1.yul --algorithm GEWEP
```

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8327. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

Rebased and added two fixes:
- Same thing that was causing MSVC failures in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8325#issuecomment-586966863
- Several spelling corrections in names. Changed from American `-ize` to British `-ise`. I still can't get used to this rule. The American spelling is so ingrained in my mind that usually don't even consciously reali~z~se I'm switching to it :)
