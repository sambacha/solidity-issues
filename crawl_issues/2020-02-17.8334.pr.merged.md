# [\#8334 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8334) `merged`: Use only conforming identifiers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2020-02-17 17:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8334):

# Description

According to the [C++ Standard](http://eel.is/c++draft/lex.name#3.1), identifiers that begin with an undercase followed by an uppercase letter are reserved to the implementation. Using them in program code makes the program ill-formed, no diagnostic required (which is effectively undefined behavior).
