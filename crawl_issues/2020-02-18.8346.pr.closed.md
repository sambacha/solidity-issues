# [\#8346 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8346) `closed`: [WIP] Extract solidity end-to-end tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5008794?u=aa5f725afdad81154a79cd5ab6be9340b08da4a9&v=4" width="50">[aarlt](https://github.com/aarlt) opened issue at [2020-02-18 21:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8346):

To generate the given solidity files a generator was used that can be found here https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/tree/62c1515bc45c4bcc587dfd52458ca783c5ff9cd1/test/tools/end2end-extractor.

The generator is checking for the used features per test-case. Currently, the generator detects that 180 test-cases are not extractable. Tests that are not extractable use 
`m_evmHost`, `m_output`, `m_contractAddress`, `m_compiler`, try to send value or need to pass arguments to the constructor. Tests using `testContractAgainstCppOnRange`, `testContractAgainstCpp` are excluded from the extraction, because these kind of tests are tested against C++ functions and are better readable compared to resulting semantic tests. Tests that call 
`compileAndRun` multiple times while defining different source-codes within a single test will also get excluded for now. 

However, 364 test-cases seem to be extractable. As for now I was not able to write a generic encoder that allows the generation of all these test-cases without any manual change.

- [X]  extraction of simple test-cases - no changes to the generated files are needed. `259 test-cases` are simple.
- [ ] extraction of test-cases that where checking for exceptions - `FAILURE` need to be added to the test-cases either manually or with the help of `isoltest`. 
- [ ] complex test-cases need to be manually rewritten. These test-cases use complex encoding and the current encoder within the generator is not able to deal with ambiguity. 
- [ ] run a solidity formatter to format the resulting tests nicely.
- [ ] removing extracted tests from `solidity/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`

As for now `259 / 364` test-cases where extracted.

@chriseth I'm still not sure whether this will be better reviewable :-(

Fixes #8197. Old PR #8284.

As I said, I do not want to review the result, I want to review the generator. If that is fine, spot-checks to the result should be all that is needed.

Run a solidity formatter: Maybe it's fine to just remove the leading tabs.

> Can you add the tool to the repository?

Sure. I just thought that it may not be very useful once we extracted all the extractable tests. However, I will add the generator to this PR.

> As I said, I do not want to review the result, I want to review the generator. If that is fine, spot-checks to the result should be all that is needed.

Yes, I agree. That would be perfect.

> Also please do not use numbers to abbreviate actual words :)

That's really a pity :D

> Run a solidity formatter: Maybe it's fine to just remove the leading tabs.

Yes, I will do that.

Can you explain the purpose of the individual files? Why did you need to add a fake compiler stack?

- `EndToEndTests.h/.cpp` defines the `End2EndExtractor` class that is derived from `ExtractorExecutionFramework`. The `.cpp` file defines needed macros and includes `SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` to "inject" the different test-cases into the `End2EndExtractor`. This is mainly done within the constructor of `End2EndExtractor`, where every `BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE` defines an `ExtractionTask`. 
```cpp
#define BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(X) m_tests[#X] = ExtractionTask(#X, [this]() { \
	    prepareTest(#X, m_tests);
```

- `ExtractionTask.h/.cpp` `prepareTest(..)` is used to set the currently running `ExtractionTask`. The original boost-test-cases became lambdas that will be bound to different `ExtractionTask` instances in `std::function<void(void)> m_task`. The class is mainly used to collect "expectations" and stores information about the extractability.

- `ExtractionExecutionFramework.h/.cpp` defines basically the context of the running boost-test-cases. For example here where methods defined like `ABI_CHECK`. Some tests access some members like `m_contractAddress`, `m_compiler`, `m_output` or `m_evmHost`. These where original member variables, but I replaced them with function calls. Like e.g.
```cpp
#define m_compiler extractor_m_compiler()
```
If those "members" where used by a specific test-case, the test-casee will be marked as not extractable.

- `FakeCompilerStack.hpp` and `FakeEvmHost.hpp` are just defining the concept of the `CompilerStack` or the `EvmHost`. These classes don't do anything. Some tests access some members of those classes. The main-reason for those classes is mainly performance. E.g. if the real compiler stack instance would have been used here, each test-case need to be actually compiled during the analysis and slows down the extraction.

Why can you avoid compiling if you actually need to run? Or do you run two passes?

I use one analysis pass that is mainly executing the bounded `m_task` function of the original `BOOST_TEST_CASE`. Here all information will be collected into the different `ExtractionTask`s. The second step is just the extraction, where the collected information are just written somewhere.

With compiling I meant the compilation of the solidity test-cases. But we already know that they are compilable. We only want to use its source-code.

@chriseth I think that the cpp based test-extractor is probably a bit too complex. So I wrote more simple test-extractor in python (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/58651e7ebd977288afa1404648395a2a4ab46fa5/test/tools/extractor.py/extractor.py). But this extractor is only able to extract the very simple test-cases. It looks like that there are 260 very simple test-cases. The python extractor is also able to preserve the comments given in the original test-cases. However, some test-cases seem to have compilation problems. I didn't investigated these problems so far.
