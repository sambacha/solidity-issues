Ethereum plans to remove support to GAS opcode, therefore this should be deprecated from Solidity, so developers get correctly advised to stop using it. 

Contracts should be advised to externalize the parameters, having the msg.sender specifying the gasused in calldata, or whatever is the logic.

Caused by https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2489

I think it is too early to make this decision based on a draft EIP.

what! I need gasleft() in my life man! Even better would be a way to help me figure out how to get tx.gasprice to work so I can get the actual gasprice in a contract one day! :)

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
