# [\#8376 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8376) `closed`: Smart contract always return TransactionReceipt

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23472881?v=4" width="50">[NicolaGessa](https://github.com/NicolaGessa) opened issue at [2020-02-24 15:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8376):

Hello all, I try to write a very simple smart contract, to call from a java program.

The contract is:
 
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Hello {

  function read() public view returns (string memory) {   
    return "Hello";
  }	

}


the java code to call the smart contract function is
Contract.read().send();

I tried in many ways, using pure , view or external, but I always receive this as result:
TransactionReceipt{transactionHash='.....

and never the string "Hello".

where is the problem? may someone show me a simple example to receive a value in return.
How to write a simple Smart contract to receive from a java program a value , like "Hello". 

thank you so much  
I use 
SOLC: Version: 0.6.3+commit.8dda9521.Linux.g++
Web3J: Version: 4.5.14

This looks like a problem with web3j. It might be due to the fact that we removed the `constant` field after having deprecated it a long time ago. Can you report the issue there? Thanks!

thank you chriseth, 
I see there is  already the same issue in web3j/web3j (without response up to now).
In any case, I tried this code (without constant):

pragma solidity ^0.5.1;

contract Hello {

  function read() public pure returns (string memory) {
    return "Hello";
  }
}

with 
SOLC: Version: 0.5.16+commit.9c3226ce.Linux.g++
Web3J: Version: 4.5.14

and it works.

So really I don't understand if it is a problem of solc or of web3j, since changing the compiler  version I get the correct value with no problem.

The deprecated field was removed in 0.6.0, this explains why it works with 0.5.16.

I'm experiencing the same issue (web3j 4.5.16 and solc 0.6.3) with view methods.

@dfsantamaria please open an issue on the web3j repository
