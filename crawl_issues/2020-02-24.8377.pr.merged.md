Is it a good idea to allow empty names? Did anyone check all the outputs we produce whether it works with that or not?

@axic I thought the same, especially regarding output selection and configuration. Tests pass though, so it's probably fine.

In standard-json, I don't think it is a problem. We allowed empty inputs before, the assert was just in relation to imports.

Also note that we use empty file names all the time in tests.
