# [\#8381 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8381) `closed`: Extraction of very simple end-to-end tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5008794?u=aa5f725afdad81154a79cd5ab6be9340b08da4a9&v=4" width="50">[aarlt](https://github.com/aarlt) opened issue at [2020-02-24 22:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8381):

This PR extracts 292 test-cases from `solidity/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`. For the extraction a simple python script was written, that can be found `scripts/end-to-end/extract-testcases.py`, where`scripts/end-to-end/remove-testcases.py` was used to delete the extracted test-cases from `solidity/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`.

- [X] run extractor to extract some test-cases
- [X] add manual changes to ensure that all the tests running correctly
- [X] remove extracted tests from `SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`
- [X] format resulting test-files

Fixes #8197.

I think it's a bit more. But I'll check this. For `eval` I'm right now not sure how to remove it. I use it to evaluated simple constant expressions for parameters/expectations. But I guess it's also possible to disable specific warnings.

I will add the changes on top of the previous commits.

overall after changing some of the regexp it looks like that we are able to extract 13 more test-cases with the python extractor... i think the main limitation right now is that those `ABI_CHECK` calls need to be in one line, but I know that there are some test-cases where these function-calls are spread to multiple lines.. I will have to check how many of those test-cases are really existing..

overall I would say that we reached the limits with this simple python extractor.. for example we are not able to evaluate variables used within the test-cases, in contrast to the python extractor the c++ based extractor would be able to also extract those.. but lets go step-by-step

it will also make sense to add support for `BOOST_CHECK`

@chriseth after removing the cbor encoded metadata from the byte-code i was now able to compare the traces of the original `soltest/SolidityEndToEndTest` and the newly extracted `soltest/semanticTests`. It looks like that 7 test-cases where not extracted correctly, either by manual changes, or by the extractor. (See`verify-testcases.py`)

294 test-cases -  7  mismatches
```

After correcting these mismatches we can be quite confident that the extraction was done correctly - even if the extractor is too hacky. 

However, as @ekpyron suggested, it may also make sense to look at the actual metadata. I will add  `--show-metadata` to `soltest`, so that we will be able to see also potential mismatches of the metadata (mismatches that are not resulting because of reformatting of the contract-sources).

Can you squash the PR a little? Also please don't check in the trace file, this should be checked but there is no need to permanently add it to the repo. Please try to restrict the extractor further. It is fine if it only extracts 50 tests as long as we make some progress and can merge a change.

Also please do not manually re-format the test files after the script has extracted it. This totally defeats the purpose. If needed, disable the style checker for the directory.

> Can you squash the PR a little? 

Sure

> Also please don't check in the trace file, this should be checked but there is no need to permanently add it to the repo. 

Sure, I did this so for at least for the "reviewing" phase its easier for everyone to run the script. But yes, it is not needed.

> Please try to restrict the extractor further. It is fine if it only extracts 50 tests as long as we make some progress and can merge a change.

Yes I can restrict this.. but as I said I think that we need to regenerate everything again..
