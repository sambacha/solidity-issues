# [\#8390 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8390) `merged`: SECURITY.md: security policy for Solidity

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-02-26 14:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8390):

Fixes #8389 

TODO
  - [x] Finish writing policy
  - [x] Link/highlight security policy in README

Points for discussion:

- What is a vulnerability? Are ICEs counted as vulnerabilities or is it a more specific set of bugs that cause "damage" for some definition of "damage"?

- How to report vulnerability? Would sending an email to `xyz@ethereum.org` encrypted with `xyz`'s PGP key suffice, where
  - email subject is `[Security] Brief description of vulnerability`
  - email body describes the vulnerability with sample input, reproduction steps, damage caused etc.

- Which versions get fixes?

- What is the patch timeline? I think industry standard is 90 calendar days but of course sooner the better.

I've probably overlooked other issues. Feel free to pitch in.
