### Description
After https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8340, the warnings that `isoltest` prints on an expectation mismatch in a semantic test, is wrong. The actual returned bytes are formatted (e.g. `library_function_selectors_struct.sol`):
```
  Expected result:
  // library: L
  // f() -> true, true, 41
  // g() -> true, true, 23

  Obtained result:
  // library: L
  // f() -> true, true, 42
  Warning: The call to "f()" returned 
  true
  true
  42
  // g() -> true, true, 23
```
instead of being printed raw:
```
  Expected result:
  // library: L
  // f() -> true, true, 41
  // g() -> true, true, 23

  Obtained result:
  // library: L
  // f() -> true, true, 42
  Warning: The call to "f()" returned 
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2a]
  // g() -> true, true, 23
```
The raw actual output (divided in 32-bytes chunks) will be printed again with this PR. Having the raw output printed helps debugging semantic tests.

Printing it formatted sounds also very useful and convenient to me.. As we also check the function signature now, the format should always be the correct one, too.

What is the case where raw really helps you? And if there are such cases, couldn't we just print both, formatted and raw?

@Marenz after this PR, we have both the raw and the formatted output. We should not rely on the function signature, after all, this is a test for the compiler.
