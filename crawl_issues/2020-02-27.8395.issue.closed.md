# [\#8395 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8395) `closed`: [solc] Fuzzing: Leak exceptions

## Abstract

Currently, the solc fuzzers invoke StandardCompiler's compileSolidity API that does **not** leak exceptions, rather "strigifies" them in the json output.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/bb09787bd0bcbcbebf7d47584e58363d332f9d92/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L763

The fuzzer harness looks for the string "InternalCompilerException" in the json output, and if found, it throws a runtime exception.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b65a165da19f150fbff39eac08729da72e4216c3/test/tools/fuzzer_common.cpp#L71

One issue with this setup is that the fuzzer believes the underlying problem is the line above (and the stack trace leading up to it), and not the original place in solidity code where the ICE was thrown.

This issue tracks support for a version of `compileSolidity` that the fuzzer could use that **leaks** the original exception so that the fuzzer is informed of a given ICE's uniqueless (via stack trace which the fuzzer uses as a proxy to measure uniqueness).

## Motivation

<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

Why don't you just use `CompilerStack` directly for this case?
