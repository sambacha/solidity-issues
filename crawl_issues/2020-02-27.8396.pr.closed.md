Looks good already!

that's a good point @ekpyron 

@chriseth suggested to use `linearizedBaseContracts` instead of `baseContracts()`, however, the following test case creates some issues with that:

for this example, the reversed linearized contracts mismatch
```
    contract I {
      function f() external virtual {}
    }
    contract A is I {
      function f() external virtual override {}
    }
    contract B is I {}
    contract C is A, B {
      function f() external override(A, I) {}
    }
```

the reversed list (filtered by the contracts specified in override) is `I, A`

You should check in what order ``super.f()`` calls the bases in this case - that's probably the order given by ``linearizedBaseContracts`` and that's probably the order we should require the mentions to have. I.e. ``linearizedBaseContracts`` is the "correct" order...

(the question how ``super`` behaves is the core of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8354 which - if I understand correctly - led to the decision to warn about this, so I'd say the required order that's not warned about should be precisely the order of ``super`` calls, right?)

Alright, so it was just my intuition that thought this is wrong then.

Better actually check what ``super`` does - I always found ``super`` to be rather weird myself, so I'd need to think about what it really does in this particular case myself :-).

FYI I'm myself not actually sure about requiring any particular order for this at all :-). IIUC we still can't guarantee that ``super.f()`` will actually call the function in the first mentioned contract, if you inherit from the whole thing again in a weird way...

Well, one motivation for this was that people thought the order in `override(a,b)` implies the order of inheritance. If we just require the same as  specified at least that particular misunderstanding is eliminated

updated to use `linearizedBaseContracts`

Closing this for now as an in-office discussion suggests we're unsure about this feature
