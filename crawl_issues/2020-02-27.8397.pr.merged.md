Please don't mention issue numbers in commit messages, it creates unnecessary notifications.

I think this PR should also remove `if (scanner->source().size() < 1024 * 256)` from `CompilerStack::ipfsUrl`, and a similar if from `CompilerStack::createCBORMetadata`.

Thanks for pointing out. I updated PR with those two changes.

Can you add tests around the point where the size needs to be broken into multiple chunks and where another levels is added?

I added one with 178 chunk and it creates 2 nodes in next level, than groups those two in final one.

Will add more of tests if needed.

@mijovic yes but can you also add tests that have
- just enough bytes to have another chunk (`nbytes(chunk)+1` bytes)
- `nbytes(chunk)` bytes

I added this one as well. Also, there is test with just enough to do multilevel (1024*256*174 + 1)

Re-checked all hashes in the test file and they are correct.
