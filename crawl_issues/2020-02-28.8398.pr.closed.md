You know the reason I joined github was inexperience out of admiration and because i knew i would receive pointers or remarks allowing for error corrections not to be thrown away. Well it will sit as a marker for ethier what github is becoming or whatit was meant for. my goals athough sparsly littered with correct syntax and compiled with tons of errors was done with the intent of helping coins going under and held with integrety. I may not know the proper scrypting I do know sincererety and the basis of the concept of decentralised only missing the mentors. Hopefully someone will pick me up after falling thats what should happen. Then i will know where my corrections lay and can use my skill of adaptiveness and quick learning ability and really build a masterpiece.
