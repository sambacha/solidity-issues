### Description

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8246#discussion_r385164254

EDIT: I moved using this for calldata arrays away from this into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8416

EDIT: I added another commit to reuse the same mechanism for calling the abi functions, while moving the tracking of "externally used functions" to old codegen's ``CompilerContext`` only.

- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)

This way we can actually get rid of the ugly ``std::shared_ptr``s for the ``MultiUseYulFunctionCollector`` and just use plain members and references instead - but I won't blow up this PR any further - I'd do it separately afterwards.

I moved actually using this into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8416, so this change itself is harmless and should be easier to review.
