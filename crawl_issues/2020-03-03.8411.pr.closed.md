I'm having an issue running some Rust tests that make use of [solidity_compile](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolc/libsolc.cpp#L131) via [solc-rust](https://github.com/axic/solc-rust). It gives me the error `You shall not have another CompilerStack aside me.` This is because my tests run in parallel by default. I've replaced the `solAssert` statement with a while lock, which makes it possible to run `solidity_compile` from separate threads without failure.

Currently, the interface to the solidity compiler is not re-entrant, i.e. for the time being only one instance of the compiler is allowed which can only be used from one thread at a time.

Your change might work for your specific use case, but it seems rather dangerous in general - it is likely to create deadlocks instead of explanatory failure messages when attempting to create multiple instances of the compiler and there could be hidden and hard-to-detect undefined behavior.

I'm not really familiar with thread-handling in rust, but what you can probably do instead is to only have a single instance of the compiler in your process that is shared among all threads and place locks around the use of the compiler on your end instead of inside the compiler. If you can guarantee that only one thread uses the compiler at any time, it should be safe to use the same compiler instance from different threads.

In the future, we might support threaded use of the compiler, but unfortunately it is not on our immediate agenda.

Since we can't merge this change as is, I'm closing this, but feel free to comment or reopen, in case you disagree.

Thanks for the explanation and suggestion. There should be a number of other ways I can get around this on the Rust side of things :)
