Regarding the tests: I think it would be nice to change all existing tests to the new syntax and then add one test for each type of expression you can use "value" on that triggers the deprecation warning.

It did produce wrong behavior, but did add fix for that.

I did update tests now, so all tests except the one testing functionality of my changes are aligned with new syntax

Actually I don't see (enough) tests for the functionality in this PR now - there should at least be one for ``<sth>.gas(...)`` and ``<sth>.value(...)`` for any type of ``<sth>`` that allows passing value, resp. gas. Did you maybe forget to push some new tests you added?

I forgot to add one file which had all of these. Now, I added all tests to separate files and PR is updated.
