~~Originally part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8408, but now extracted.
Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8408~~ [merged]

The increased test coverage in fact revealed a minor bug in the yul util function for call data tail access that I fixed here as well (see comment).

I also ported the revert strings from the old codegen to the yul util function version and added another revert string for the last revert lacking one together with a test case for it.
