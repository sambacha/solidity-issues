### Description
The eighth pull request implementing #7806. Depends on #8328.

This is a refactoring PR with no new functionality visible to the user (except for slight changes in the `--help` text).

The main goal was to split `main.cpp` into a set of classes with clear responsibilities and get a good base for extending the command-line interface. The following new classes were introduced:
- `Phaser`: the controller responsible for parsing command-line input and deciding what other components to call and in what order.
- `AlgorithmRunner` (extracted from `GeneticAlgorithm`): does all the chores and extra functionality that happen between algorithm rounds. Currently this consists mostly of updating its state and printing the population but upcoming PRs add more: population autosave, extra output and statistics, time measurements, cache management.
- Factories (defined in `Phaser.h`) for creating main components with parameters requested on the command-line:
    - `GeneticAlgorithmFactory`
    - `FitnessMetricFactory`
    - `PopulationFactory`
    - `ProgramFactory`

This was also a good occasion for some general cleanup:
- Tweaking command-line option definitions (names for parameters of options shown by `--help`, option groups).
- Generic helpers for easily implementing `<<` and `>>` operators for enums used by command-line options.
- I needed to create a new module for phaser's utilities. I went with the existing convention of naming it `Common` but this caused a naming conflict with the `Common` module I have created earlier in tests so I decided to rename the latter. I went with `TestHelpers`.

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8328. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
