# [\#8422 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8422) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Error handling

### Description
The ninth pull request implementing #7806. Depends on #8421.

This PR changes the way `yul-phaser` reports and handles errors:
- If parsing or analysis fails for a Yul program, the application will now print the list of errors to `stderr`.
- The top-level exception handler now catches all exceptions not handled at lower layers, tries to get some useful debugging information out of them (like code location and function in case of `solidity::util::Exception`) and then rethrows them to make the program fail, as expected in case of a bug. This is just to help debugging since all exceptions that can happen during normal operation should already be handled by that point.
- Added a few more specific exception types and `catch` blocks that handle them.
- `--help` no longer exists with error status.

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8421. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
