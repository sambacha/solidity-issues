# [\#8424 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8424) `merged`: OptimiserSuite::runSequence() overload for step abbreviations

### Description
This PR is related to #7806 but is independent from the other `yul-phaser` PRs and based directly on `develop`.

The PR modifies `OptimiserSuite` to allow executing optimisation steps specified using abbreviation strings produced by `yul-phaser`. The new function can also repeat parts wrapped in parentheses and ignores whitespace added for readability.

I don't expect it to be merged as is. It's just a proposal that needs to be discussed first:
1. I have replaced the current sequence with an abbreviated one but this is unfortunately harder to decipher than full step names. I can easily remove that commit if we don't want that.
    - On the other hand the current sequence is going to be replaced by the one from `yul-phaser` in the future anyway so maybe having full names in it until then isn't such a big concern.
2. I could add any tests for newly added code because the public API of `OptimiserSuite` currently does not allow creating new instances. Only the `run()` method can create one but it never returns it.
    - We could try to test that `run()` itself executes the right steps but such a test would be very fragile and complex. It's not worth it in my opinion.
3. The function does not support nested parentheses since I don't think it such a feature would be useful in practice.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [ ] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [ ] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

I think this is fine to do, but only once we prove that the phaser can come up with a better sequence than we can do manually :)

Ok. Great. In that case I'll submit it as non-draft when I'm done with the experiments and they turn out fine.

Please fix the assertion and squash a little.

Squashed. There are only three commits now.

I just realized that I used `solAssert` instead of `yulAssert`. Fixed.

Sorry, for interrupting the checks and invalidating the review but I thought it would be best if I could still include it in this PR.
