# [\#8428 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8428) `merged`: Control flow analysis for inline assembly.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-03-05 09:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8428):

Now depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8429

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8375. At least for the most part - inline assembly functions and calls to them are ignored so far, which creates one loop-hole when an assembly function uses "return" and some false positives, if the assembly function always "reverts" (otherwise external variables cannot be accessed via assembly functions, so that's not a danger).

Function calls are also ignored in the solidity CFG analysis at the moment, though - however there is no similar loop-hole for storage returns for them.

I'm thinking about detecting returns in functions defined in assembly or to generally handle function calls both for solidity and assembly, but that would complicate the analysis (especially with e.g. mutually recursive calls, etc.).

However, calling "return" from inline assembly is generally a bit flaky for this analysis, since there is no way to properly analyze the returndata...

~~Ok, apparently I need to make clang happy first.~~ Should be fixed.

I think the test failure is due to some bug in yul ast import - I'm investigating.

Rebased this on top of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8429 - that should fix the AST import/export test failures.

Can you at least add a visitor for "leave", in case we want to extend the support for yul functions?

I think I addressed everything except using the dialect for "return" and "revert" - I think the dialect doesn't yet support querying those, so we'll need to add that (or I have missed it so far).
