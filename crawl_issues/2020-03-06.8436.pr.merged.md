Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8434.
About which I'm *extremely* embarrassed, that I apparently introduced it in 0.6.2, I don't know what I was thinking.
But I also can't believe that we didn't have a single test case for this.

I actually think we should release 0.6.4 pretty much immediately after this is merged, because this was just utterly broken :-(. Also having this go unnoticed until now, pretty much shows that few people have been using 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 so far...

I think I agree with releasing soon.

In my defense: I did say that I was unsure about https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8137...
