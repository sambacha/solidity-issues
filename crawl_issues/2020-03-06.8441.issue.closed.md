## Abstract
Currently `abi.encodePacked` adds padding to arrays.  `abi.encode` can be used for that.

Please change `abi.encodePacked` so that it returns bytes of arrays without padding. I ran into a situation where `abi.encodePacked` would have been really useful if it did not pad arrays with zeros.

It would be great if the following was true:
```Solidity
uint8 value1 = 1;
uint8 value2 = 2;
uint8 value3 = 3;
uint8[] memory threeValuesArray = new uint8[](3);
threeValuesArray[0] = value1;
threeValuesArray[1] = value2;
threeValuesArray[2] = value3;

abi.encodePacked(value1, value2, value3) == abi.encodePacked(threeValuesArray)
```

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.

The functio `abi.encodePacked` was implemented to mimik the behaviour of several implicit operations in old Solidity versions. We actually planned to not touch it anymore. Since I somehow see the need, we could introduce `abi.encodeTightlyPacked`, though.

@chriseth That would be awesome, thanks!

I've found a workaround for this but It requires the [BytesLib.sol](https://github.com/GNSPS/solidity-bytes-utils/blob/master/contracts/BytesLib.sol). Since `encodePacked` does not use any padding you can just append to each other. (There might be a better approach for this and I don't know If it's gas efficient or not.)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "https://github.com/GNSPS/solidity-bytes-utils/blob/master/contracts/BytesLib.sol";

contract Test {
    using BytesLib for bytes;

    /**
     * Workaround for the `https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8441`.
     * @notice Requires `BytesLib.sol` at `https://github.com/GNSPS/solidity-bytes-utils/blob/master/contracts/BytesLib.sol`
     */ 
    function encodeTightlyPacked(address[] memory path) internal pure returns(bytes memory encoded) {
        for (uint i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {
            encoded = encoded.concat(
                abi.encodePacked(path[i])
            );
        }
    }

    function test() public view returns (bytes memory t1, bytes memory t2) {
        address[] memory path = new address[](3);
        path[0] = 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D;
        path[1] = 0xE592427A0AEce92De3Edee1F18E0157C05861564;
        path[2] = 0xaD6D458402F60fD3Bd25163575031ACDce07538D;

        t1 = abi.encodePacked(path[0], path[1], path[2]);
        t2 = encodeTightlyPacked(path);
    }
}
```

The result;

```
t1 = 0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488de592427a0aece92de3edee1f18e0157c05861564ad6d458402f60fd3bd25163575031acdce07538d
t2 = 0x7a250d5630b4cf539739df2c5dacb4c659f2488de592427a0aece92de3edee1f18e0157c05861564ad6d458402f60fd3bd25163575031acdce07538d

@tarik0 the language supports `bytes.concat()` since a while, which I believe would allow you to write:
```solidity
        uint len = arr.length;
        for (uint i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            encoded = bytes.concat(
                encoded,
                abi.encodePacked(path[i])
            );
        }
```

It is not super optimal as it will waste memory quite a bit.

My current workaround (very verbose, but generic and decently gas-efficient):
https://github.com/latticexyz/mud/blob/cb731e0937e614bb316e6bc824813799559956c8/packages/store/src/tightcoder/EncodeArray.sol

On a similar note, an `abi.decodeTightlyPacked` coupled with memory slices would be useful as well to replace this:

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
