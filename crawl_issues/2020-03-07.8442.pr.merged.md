Can you please rebase and squash a little? I think this will be reviewed in its entirety anyway.

The original bug #8442 has several bullets. Here are corresponding commits and PR.

> remove validateSettings and the related variables m_settings and m_validateSettings. Instead add a function void addSetting() that takes a string and a lambda/function pointer that is called for each setting that is found. The lambda can set desired member variables or throw if the setting is invalid.

See 6594523.

> To keep the mechanic of validateSettings that we can cause tests not to be run based on various conditions the idea is to add a member variable bool m_shouldRun = true that any member function can set to false

See PR #8458.

> There is currently logic in both YulOptimizerTest and libyul/SyntaxTest that validates/handles the dialect option that should be unified.

See 74c508c.

> the name of printExpectationAndError does not make it obvious that it checks for errors, too

See 1588996.
