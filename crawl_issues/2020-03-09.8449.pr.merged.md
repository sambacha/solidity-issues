# [\#8449 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8449) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Multi-program support

### Description
The eleventh pull request implementing #7806. Depends on #8423.

This pull request introduces new fitness metrics that allow the phaser to work with multiple input programs:
- Multiple metrics can now be passed to classes derived from `FitnessMetricCombination` to compute average, sum, minimum or maximum. This way we can compute fitness given more than one program.
- `RelativeProgramSize` is a new metric that computes the ratio between the optimised and unoptimised program size. This should be more useful than the absolute `ProgramSize` for multiple programs that differ in size.
- `--metric` and `--metric-aggregator` options allow selecting metric type and the way to combine it for multiple programs. The default is the average of relative sizes.
- Since metrics currently operate on integer values, we need to scale the results from the relative metric before rounding them if we want to have any precision at all. `--relative-metric-scale x` option makes the metric multiply its results by `10^x`. E.g. with `--relative-metric-scale 4`: 1.0 becomes 10000, 0.5 becomes 5000, 2.0 becomes 20000 and so on.
- Turns out it's useful to have some mutable state in the metric (in particular: the program cache introduced in the next PR). `FitnessMetric::evaluate()` is now non-`const`.

### Example invocation
Minimal:
``` bash
tools/yul-phaser                                                   \
    $(find ../test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite -name *.yul) \
    --random-population 20                                         \
    --metric relative-code-size                                    \
    --metric-aggregator average                                    \
    --relative-metric-scale 1000
```

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8423. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

Ah, with RelativeProgramSize, computing an average fitness makes sense!
