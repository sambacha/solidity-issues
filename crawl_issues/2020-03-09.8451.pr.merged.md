# [\#8451 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8451) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Program cache

### Description
The twelfth pull request implementing #7806. Depends on #8449.

This pull request adds `ProgramCache` which stores the results of intermediate program optimisations to speed up evaluations of chromosomes.

Currently the cache is very rudimentary and just keeps every prefix from the current round and the one before it. There's no way to prune the content during a round which for large chromosomes and programs can easily exhaust machine's RAM. For that reason the cache is disabled by default and has to be enabled with `--program-cache` option.

A better strategy for selecting the prefixes to cache and a limiter could improve that in the future. Still, the cache is already useful and provides a good speedup if the data fits in memory.

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8449. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
