# [\#8452 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8452) `merged`: [yul-phaser] More output

### Description
The thirteenth pull request implementing #7806. Depends on #8451.

This pull request adds extra options for controlling phaser output:
- `--show-initial-population`: Prints the population and its fitness just before the algorithm starts. Useful in combination with `--rounds 0` and `--population-from-file` to see fitness in a different metric.
- `--show-only-top-chromosome` gives more compact output - only one chromosome per round.
    - Normal output is also more compact, without labels, more suitable for capture and processing via scripts.
- `--hide-round` hides the round header.
- Elapsed CPU time is now printed after each round.
- `--mode` specifies mode of operation:
    - `run-algorithm`: runs the algorithm as usual. This is the default
    - `print-optimised-programs` prints the Yul code of the optimised programs from the initial population. It's most useful with `--rounds 0` and a single chromosome as input.
    - `print-optimised-asts`: works like `print-optimised-programs` but prints the JSON-serialised ASTs instead of Yul code.
- `--show-cache-stats` tells you how the cache is performing. In particular the number of cached and non-cached intermediate programs.
- The program no longer prints the random seed on startup. Use `--show-seed` option to see it.

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8451. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
