# [\#8453 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8453) `merged`: Configurable CodeSize metric

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-03-09 10:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8453):

### Description
The fourteenth pull request implementing #7806. Depends on #8452.

This PR modifies the `CodeSize` metric to add customizable weights for all possible statement and expression types. It provides defaults so that the metric keeps working as it used to if you don't change anything but allows `yul-phaser` to use different values at the same time.

The default for `yul-phaser` is similar to `CodeSize`'s default but with ones for items that `CodeSize` assigns zero to.

Weights can now also be controlled from the command-line.

### Example invocation
``` bash

I'm not sure if this is the way to go. This adds tons of parameters and the phaser is anyway targeted at people who re-compile solidity all the time, so it is not hard to add some custom modifications. It might even turn out that the best metric is one that cannot be expressed using these parameters but has to take some structural information into account...

Are you referring specifically to command-line parameters or to parameterizing `CodeSize` metric in general? It's not clear to me if the whole PR needs modifications or if it's just the command-line parameters.

As to the command-line parameters, they make it easier to run scripted experiments. Since we still don't know what metric we'll eventually use for the phaser I thought it was likely we would want to compare results for different values. Running experiments takes time and it's convenient to be able to script them and just let them run overnight. That's a bit harder if you have to change the code and recompile before each run. These parameters were not hard to add in the current structure so I saw no significant downsides to it. It's all encapsulated in `CodeWeightFactory` and  `Phaser::buildCommandLineDescription`. After that they're just passed through the class hierarchy in a struct until they reach `CodeSize`.

There are already tons of other parameters that are only useful for experimenting and we'll likely want to remove or hard-code many of them down the line. I think it's a bit too early for this tool to have a stable command-line API though.  The thing is, it won't really be clear which ones we want to keep until you start using it in practice and know from experience what is useful and what is not. Until then having a wide range of parameters at least makes it easier for me to run quick one-off experiments and give you answers if you notice you're getting suboptimal results. Since all these parameters (including the weights for the metric) have good defaults I don't think having them is a big burden to the user.

As for making `CodeSize` configurable, I think it's a pretty natural extension that's not tied to phaser in any way. I would create a separate metric class as soon as something more specific was needed  but for now this was enough.

That's my reasoning but in the end it's your call. If you want I can remove the command-line parameters and/or the modifications to `CodeSize` and just create a custom metric class in `tools/yulPhaser/`. There's nothing in the remaining PRs that depends on these changes.

Does this slow down the optimizer with regards to costs fixed in code?

I don't think so but I did not actually measure it. I can check.

Moving it out of draft status. I'm not yet finished with review fixes though.

I'm still testing the performance. I'll post my results in a moment.

Fortunately it looks like there's basically no difference :)

### Performance test
`yul-phaser` is actually a good way to benchmark this. I you choose the random algorithm without elite and a specific seed, it's basically applying long random sequences of optimizations in a deterministic way.

Here's what I did:
``` bash
for i in $(seq 10); do
    time tools/yul-phaser ../test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullSuite/*.yul
        --seed                   1
        --random-population      10
        --algorithm              random
        --random-elite-pool-size 0
        --rounds                 10
done
```

### Results
Here are the timings from each run, in seconds. This is the "real" time reported by `time`. "sys" was on the order of 0.01 s in every case.

"original metric" is the code from `develop` and "configurable metric" is the first commit from this PR. That's the only commit that affects anything outside phaser's source.

| run         | original metric | configurable metric |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1           | 8.300           | 8.706               |
| 2           | 8.265           | 8.925               |
| 3           | 8.587           | 8.632               |
| 4           | 9.821           | 8.619               |
| 5           | 8.656           | 8.449               |
| 6           | 8.323           | 8.454               |
| 7           | 8.493           | 8.600               |
| 8           | 8.552           | 8.628               |
| 9           | 8.786           | 8.606               |
| 10          | 9.178           | 8.660               |
| **average** | **8.6961**      | **8.6279**          |

As noted above, each run used the same exact optimization sequences due to the use of the same seed so they're directly comparable.
