the failed zepplin test seems to be because it uses `override` etc which this compiler version doesn't support. Not sure why it does that.. maybe the test files are fetched externally.

Don't know the problem with the solcjs test. Help appreciated.

@axic any idea what the solc-js problem could be here? Can it be related to the release version?

We probably need to patch soljson.js here, let me check.

So adding
```
# Patch soljson.js to provide backwards-compatibility with older emscripten versions
echo ";/* backwards compatibility */ Module['Runtime'] = Module;" >> $BUILD_DIR/libsolc/soljson.js
```
to ``build_emscripten.sh`` right before copying to the ``upload/`` directory should fix this, but thinking about it, it shouldn't be necessary and may be an issue in solc-js - I'll quickly check there.

Hm, that's weird... the ``soljson.js`` built by CI here, *does* correctly contain that workaround...

Ah, right, I know why this happens. This is (IMHO) pretty annoying about the ``solc-js`` tests... it will download the most recent version of soljson.js on its own (i.e. 0.6.4) and run against that as well without being asked... and in that we don't have the workarounds anymore...

I.e. the failure is entirely harmless, but it will be hard to fix...

One option would be to add
``sed -i -e 's/latest/v0.5.16+commit.9c3226ce/' test/package.js``
Right before running the tests in ``test/solcjsTests.sh``.
Or actually maybe better ``sed -i -e 's/latest/v0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a/' test/package.js``.

It's running on solc-js version 0.5.0 and we don't want to test that against latest (i.e. 0.6.4), since that is bound to break. Actually we don't want to test against any remote version here at all :-D... but the sanest choice, since we kind of have to, would be ``v0.5.0``.

The other test run: ``t_ems_compile_ext_zeppelin``: if we want that to pass we need to downgrade to a version of zeppelin that is 0.5 compatible. I.e. replace ``master`` in
``test/externalTests/zeppelin.sh`` with some appropriate branch/tag/commit.

Sigh.. would be fine with not passing the zeppelin test

Update:
* Added test for multiple inheritance

Looks good! I'll make this the release PR directly.
