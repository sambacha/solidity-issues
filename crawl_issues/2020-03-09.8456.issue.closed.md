# [\#8456 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8456) `closed`: Refactor YulUtilFunctions::revertReasonIfDebug to return an actual function
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

YulUtilFunctions::revertReasonIfDebug currently returns code while all other functions in that class return a function. This can be refactored now that we have `CompilerContext::callYulFunction`

A lot of times `YulUtilFunctions::revertReasonIfDebug` is called from `Whiskers` in inline assembly blocks, so it is not really possible to call with `CompilerContext::callYulFunction`
Maybe we can write similar function in `CompilerContext` that calls `YulUtilFunction`s from inline assembly as well

Maybe we should also just keep it inlined in the old code generator (is that what you meant?).

Sample usage, for example in `CompilerUtils.cpp` around like 291
```
Whiskers templ(R"({
	if gt(ptr, 0x100000000) { <revertStringPointer> }
	...
	if gt(array_data_start, input_end) { <revertStringStart> }
	...
	mstore(dst, array_length)
	dst := add(dst, 0x20)
})");
templ("revertStringPointer", m_context.revertReasonIfDebug("ABI memory decoding: invalid data pointer"));
...
m_context.appendInlineAssembly(templ.render(), {"input_end", "base_offset", "offset", "ptr", "dst"});
```

So, maybe to inline it via `revertReasonIfDebug` (as a return string) in CompilerContext, and using function from `YulUtilFunctions` where possible. Bad thing is that if we do like this we will have same code on two places

@mijovic since you worked on #10765, how much work do you think this issue would be?

I tried to fix this with #9195 some time ago, but the actual problem is that most of the time this is called from inline assembly for old codegen.
And I think it makes sense to do this after #8559 or something similar. The think is that inline assembly doesn't see yul util functions...

However for IR this would be easy I think

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
