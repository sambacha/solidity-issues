292 test-cases -  1  mismatche(s)
```
The cause of the mismatch was a typo within the original boost test-case:
```
ABI_CHECK(callContractFunction("f(uint)", 0), encodeArgs());
ABI_CHECK(callContractFunction("g(uint)", 0), encodeArgs());
ABI_CHECK(callContractFunction("h()"), encodeArgs(2));
```
signatures need to be `f(uint256)` and `g(uint256)`

@chriseth This PR is based on the verification of the original test traces (created with`./soltest --log_level=test_suite -t SolidityEndToEndTest/ -- --no-smt --show-messages`) vs. the traces created by the extracted tests (created with `./soltest --log_level=test_suite -t semanticTests/extracted -- --no-smt --show-messages`). For the comparation of these traces `scripts/end-to-end/verify-testcases.py` was used.

I also added the `scripts/end-to-end/remove-testcases.py` script here. From my point of view someone can just add newly extracted files (manually or automated) to `semanticTests/extracted`, create the traces, run the verifier and if everything was ok, execute `scripts/end-to-end/remove-testcases.py > SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`.

@aarlt Could you add a command line option like ``-i`` to ``remove-testcases.py`` that puts it in "interactive mode"? I.e. for each test case it outputs the whole ``BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(...) {...}`` part it is going to remove together with the corresponding extracted file and waits for user input to continue.
That way I could quickly step through the 292 test cases and confirm visually for a second or so that it looks ok. That plus looking at the traces I would consider enough to approve this.

@aarlt Also what about the plan to also add the metadata to the traces and to compare it (excluding the sources)?

Thats a really nice idea!

I will do that today. I will create a new PR for this.

With the single step thing, this looks good, I would say. Can you do it in a way that it displays a diff somehow? At best with "inline diff", ignoring whitespace and marking intra-line changes bold

@ekpyron @chriseth I added a simple interactive mode to view the extracted test-cases. I was not really able to find a nice way to visualise with `diff`. I hope that the simple visualisation I've implemented here helps a bit.

usage: `./remove-testcases.py [-i] [-f <full path to SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp>]`

You should point with `-f` to a location of `SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` file of the `develop` branch.

Can you avoid requiring a return confirmation for the ``(y/n)`` answer? So that hitting a ``y`` or ``n`` key once suffices without further confirmation?

@chriseth @ekpyron I added a simple bash script `create_traces.sh` that will create the needed trace-files for `verify-testcases.py`. `verify-testcases.py` will compare the metadata, all `create` and `call` messages. Basically it just compares the traces of the original end-to-end tests (`SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`) with the traces that where generated by the extracted tests. Just execute `./verify-testcases.py`. 

To be able to review the extracted test-cases the `remove-testcases.py` script can be used in interactive mode. You will need to point to a `SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` file where the tests where not yet extracted, e.g. use the current `develop` branch. If you use `create_traces.sh`, you can use the already checked out `develop` branch to point to `SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` with `./remove-testcases.py -i -f solidity-develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`. 

The diff-tool used by the `remove-testcases.py` script can be defined by setting the `DIFF` environment variable.

Scripts look ok, will take a look at the tests now.
