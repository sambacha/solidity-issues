Maybe it'll fail the smtCheckerTestsJSON, looking into it now

How's this still failing...

Ah damn it... I know why... ``This will report a warning`` will not just *allow* a warning, but it will *require* a warning, so this will now succeed on travis, but fail everywhere else, where we have SMT solvers... *sigh*...

This is pretty annoying :-). One solution I see would be to add a new marker for the command line tests "This *may* report a warning"... but then we might as well really have "This requires SMT solvers.", but the command line test script won't know if we have SMT solvers... not sure what's the best solution to this ordeal anymore...

We might as well just disable them. We already have SMTChecker tests, and these are only two docs tests

Yeah... we should create an issue for sorting this out, but disabling them for now is ok I guess.
