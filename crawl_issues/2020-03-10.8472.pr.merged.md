I think I'll add some unit tests to ``test/libevmasm/Optimiser.cpp``.

We need tests for:

 -    immutable internal function pointer
 -   multiple creation cascades (contracts that create contracts that have immutables, etc)
- multi-word immutables like external function pointer

The assembly now requires that all immutables are assigned. Because of that, the test failed and had to be adapted.

Ah, there already is a test for external function pointer!

This is complete now, but has a test that fails on purpose: It uses `uint immutable x = 2;` - do we want to allow initialization at point of declaration?

Is there any potential issue with allowing it? If there is no issue, I would allow it.

I think I'll add the tests expected to fail to their own PR.

Maybe squash the last 3 commits?

Only squashing the last three was a bit complicated.
