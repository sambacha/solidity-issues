I think it may be easier to start with conversions from array slices to arrays. Try the following test case:
```
    contract C {
        function f(uint256[] calldata x, uint256 s, uint256 e) external returns (uint256[] memory) {
                return uint256[](x[s:e]);
        }
    }
// ====
// compileViaYul: only
// ----
// f(uint256[],uint256,uint256): 0x60, 2, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 32, 2, 3, 4
```

You will notice that this throws in ``YulUtilFunctions::conversionFunctionSpecial`` called from ``YulUtilFunctions::conversionFunction``. But you can just add a simple special case to the top of ``conversionFunction``: a dynamic calldata array slice can be converted to a dynamic calldata array just by an identity function:
```
function <functionName>(offset, length) -> outOffset, outLength {
        outOffset := offset
        outLength := outLength
}
```
If you haven't already, then rebase to develop - there ``conversionFunction`` got a quite similar case for external function pointers at the very top.
We can revisit adding ``length`` afterwards. Do you think that makes sense?

I agree with you, will do the test like this now, and update PR

I did convert function, but it still fails with:
std::exception::what: Type conversion uint256[] calldata -> uint256[] memory not yet implemented.

Ah, damn, I thought that was already implemented. Then you need to test length and elements, the following should work:
```
    contract C {
        function f(uint256[] calldata x, uint256 s, uint256 e) external returns (uint256) {
                return uint256[](x[s:e]).length;
        }
        function g(uint256[] calldata x, uint256 s, uint256 e, uint256 idx) external returns (uint256) {
                return uint256[](x[s:e])[idx];
        }
    }
// ====
// compileViaYul: only
// ----
// f(uint256[],uint256,uint256): 0x60, 2, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 2 # resp. 5 as long as you don't actually slice #
// g(uint256[],uint256,uint256,uint256): 0x80, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 3 # resp. 0 as long as you don't actually slice #
// g(uint256[],uint256,uint256,uint256): 0x80, 2, 4, 1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 4 # resp. 1 as long as you don't actually slice #
// ...
```

Ok, I did it like this, now looking to do the slicing itself

@ekpyron I did fix the cosmetics and assertions
Also revertReson if debug added instead of invalid()
