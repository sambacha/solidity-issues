# [\#8480 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8480) `merged`: Replaced "assert" with "if"

Replaced "assert" with "if" (incorrect contract code is not supposed to trigger asserts).

Please don't use issue numbers in the PR title but rather in the comment.

Can you add some tests, please?

Also, please justify why the assert can just be removed. Will the error be caught later or is it not an error at all?

The justification is in #8418, now extended to address your question.

Ok, in that case, I think the following solution should be safe enough:
 - change rootVariableDeclaration to return nullptr on failure instead of asserting and change the documentation
 - add a check for nullptr to the two places where it is used and assert that the error reporter already has an error.

Do you mean that the failing first and second `rootVariableDeclaration` should not lead to returning the same error twice?

My understanding is that the second call to `rootVariableDeclaration()` is not supposed to happen at all if the first call fails.

That looks much better now! I think you forgot to update a test expectation and please also add a changelog entry.
