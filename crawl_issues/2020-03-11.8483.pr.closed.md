# [\#8483 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8483) `closed`: Antlr4 based grammar, with CI integration.

Implements #8482.

### STATUS

* initial working version of CI tested solidity Antlr4 grammar.
* the grammar itself isn't fixed yet (it's the one from https://github.com/solidityj/solidity-antlr4 which is heavily out of date).

### TODO
* consider starting grammar from scratch? (may be easier), or walk through each rule item by item and verify along with running the tests.
* make sure the grammar passes **ALL** syntax tests

This one is the most up-to-date version of the grammar I know today. We're trying to maintain it on a best-effort basis.

The plan was to move maintenance upstream. Is it okay to use yours as the basis of this PR then, @GNSPS?
