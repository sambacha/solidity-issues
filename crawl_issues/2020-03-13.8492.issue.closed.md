Documentation is here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.4/yul.html

In the documentation there is a link to "Yul object notation".  It points to here:
https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.4/yul-objects

No webpage exists there.

Also, there is another link to here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.4/yul-objects
That does not work.
