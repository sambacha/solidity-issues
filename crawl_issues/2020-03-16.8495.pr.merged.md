A space has been removed from an if statement in StandardCompiler.cpp, at line 227, thus introducing a coding style violation. The purpose is to see how CircleCI reacts to this. Next, I will try to get CircleCI to comment about this line directly on the diff.

I do not mean for this to be merged, I just couldn't think of any other way to test CircleCI's behavior.

Hey! Actually if possible a bit, yes. I've managed to post the diff review, but I'm off by about 10 lines usually (by just using the line number from the check style script), and I'm not sure why or where to look for line number rules in GitHub.

For reference, here is a PR on my fork with this behavior: https://github.com/davidcian/solidity/pull/1

@chriseth I think everything should be alright now, although I suspect I've missed a couple of details. The bot posts diff review comments with the text "Coding style error" on the affected lines, one comment per violation.

Can you squash to a single commit, please?

I've done my best, but for some reason I'm not sure how to further squash the remaining commits. When I do git log or even when I attempt to git rebase interactive with the commit hash of the first commit, I can't find the three remaining commits in the opened editor so I can squash them.

The problem probably is that `develop` was merged into the branch and not rebased.
