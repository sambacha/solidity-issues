## Description

- Support for different checksum encodings regarding https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1191.md

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): any
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): any
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: no Ethereum Main clients
- Operating system: any

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract X {
    address x = 0x1820a4b7618bde71dce8cdc73aab6c95905fad24;
}
```

Throws
```
SyntaxError: This looks like an address but has an invalid checksum. Correct checksummed address: "0x1820a4B7618BdE71Dce8cdc73aAB6C95905faD24". If this is not used as an address, please prepend '00'. For more information please see https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#address-literals
    address x = 0x1820a4b7618bde71dce8cdc73aab6c95905fad24;
                ^----------------------------------------^

Do you have any proposed solution on how to denote addresses of other chains?

What about adding network id to the settings? Where you choose evm version.

Please note that currently we have no notion of other chains at all, `EVMVersion` follows "mainnet" versions only.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
