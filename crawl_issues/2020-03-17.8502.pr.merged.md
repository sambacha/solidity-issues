I think there was an error during the rebase, can you please check?

@chriseth Updated with correct minimal versions for all tests, and slightly better handing of version of compiler:
if less than 0.4.11 -> uses 0.4.11
if  >=0.4.11 and <0.4.22 it usess set of arguments for solc which were available at that time
>= 0.4.22 it uses all available arguments

Also, I think that part of this PR should be inclusion of this script in CI

Is the new version check script called as part of the CI?
