### Description
Part of the final set of PRs for #7806.

Adds `--prefix` option that lets user specify a series of initial optimisation steps automatically applied to every input program. The result is treated as if it was the actual input, i.e. the steps are not considered a part of the chromosomes and cannot be mutated. The values of relative metric values are also relative to the fitness of a program with these steps applied rather than the fitness of the original program.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
