### Description
Part of the final set of PRs for #7806.

Adds an implementation of a classic genetic algorithm as described in "Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs" by Zbigniew Michalewicz (page  34) with some minor enhancements like support for elitism and variable-length chromosomes. For the analysis of the performace of this algorithm compared to GEWEP see my recent [experiment report](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7806#issuecomment-598644491).

Includes a few structural changes needed for the implementation:
- Symmetric crossover operators. In the classic GA crossover produces two chromosomes from the same set of parents. I could not simulate this by just using the current crossover twice with swapped parameters because the results are random and subsequent calls could choose different crossover points.
- Support for returning the "remainder" of a population that did not take part in crossover. Since `Selection::materialise()` and `PairSelection::materialise()` may return different random results with each call, this was also not possible to simulate with two separate calls. This could be similarly implemented for `Population::mutate()` and `Population::select()` but in the end I only needed it for crossover.
- The classic algorithm has a custom `select()` method because the results of its selection phase depend on fitness of individuals which is not available to specialisations of `Selection`. `Selection` should be refactored to have access to that information but I did not think it was worth doing it right now just for this single algorithm.
- `mutationSequence()` simply applies a series of mutations passed to it. This is mostly an optimisation which allows us to have only one call to `Population::mutate()` per round. With three different mutations applied separately the population would unnecessarily recalculate fitness multiple times for individuals that undergo more than one mutation type.
- `Population` constructor that accepts `Individual`s is now public. This allows us to move individuals from one population to another without fitness recalculation. Necessary because of the custom selection in the classic algorithm. The downside is that you can create a population where fitness values do not match the metric (though this could also be a feature when used carefully).

### Dependencies
~This PR is based on #8453. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.~ Since this PR doesn't depend on anything from #8453 and all the other dependencies from below that PR are already merged, I rebased it on `develop`.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages

@chriseth Since this PR does not depend on #8453 (only on the PRs below it that have already been merged) and #8453 turned out to be a bit controversial, I rebased it directly on `develop`. It can now be reviewed independently.
