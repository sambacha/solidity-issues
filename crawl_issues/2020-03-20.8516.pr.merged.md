### Description
Part of the final set of PRs for #7806.

This PR implements two-point and uniform crossover operators. The performance of these operators was analysed in my recent [experiment report](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7806#issuecomment-598644491).

It also adds an option for selecting the operator from command line (`--crossover`).

### Dependencies
This PR is based on #8515. Unfortunately changes from that base PR will show through in the combined diff and on the commit list until it gets merged.

### Checklist
- [x] Code compiles correctly
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] New tests have been created which fail without the change (if possible)
- [x] README / documentation was extended, if necessary
- [ ] Changelog entry (if change is visible to the user)
- [x] Used meaningful commit messages
