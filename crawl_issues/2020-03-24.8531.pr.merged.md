# [\#8531 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8531) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Add SortProvider

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-03-24 21:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8531):

This PR refactors `Kind` and `Sort*` out of `SolverInterface` and creates `SortProvider` to host `intSort` and `boolSort`, sorts that were used frequently.
Since it's only these two sorts I made it a simple struct instead of something more elaborate like `TypeProvider`.

They are still `shared_ptr` because `smt::Expression` relies on that. Maybe we can check how to move that to `unique_ptr` as a next step.
