@chriseth i'm not sure whether it is good to forbid `notice` on non-public state variables. it is used a lot by contract developers. Some examples:

- colonyNetwork @ contracts/ReputationMiningCycle.sol
```solidity
contract ReputationMiningCycle is ReputationMiningCycleStorage, PatriciaTreeProofs, DSMath {
  /// @notice Minimum reputation mining stake in CLNY
  uint256 constant MIN_STAKE = 2000 * WAD;

  /// @notice Size of mining window in seconds
  uint256 constant MINING_WINDOW_SIZE = 60 * 60 * 24; // 24 hours
  ...
}
```
- OpenZeppelin @ contracts/drafts/ERC20Migrator.sol:
```solidity
contract ERC20Migrator {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    /// Address of the old token contract
    IERC20 private _legacyToken;

    /// Address of the new token contract
    ERC20Mintable private _newToken;
    ...
}
```
- Solidity Documentation
```solidity
    contract Fund {
        /// Mapping of ether shares of the contract.
        mapping(address => uint) shares;
        /// Withdraw your share.
        function withdraw() public {
            (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: shares[msg.sender]}("");
            if (success)
                shares[msg.sender] = 0;
        }
    }
```

@aarlt `@notice` is useless on non-public functions. We can add a warning now and disallow it in 0.7.0.

@christianparpart somehow strange that I could not comment on your reviews directly. At least it seem not to work on every review comment that you did.

However, I changed now some errors to warnings. With this there was no need to change the tests too much. The changes of the tests where mainly needed, because either there where natspec's with `@notice` tag on a non-public state variable, or natspecs on local-variables (only natspecs on state-variables is allowed). These errors are now warnings, so the tests can now stay like this until 0.7.0.

@chriseth @christianparpart I squashed the commits. I think I integrated all your feedbacks.

@chriseth right now this PR is just creating warnings that state that the warning will become an error in `v0.7.0`. I think I should also create the changes for `v0.7.0` too. Is the `breaking` branch the base for `v0.7.0`?

Or is it better to wait until this is merged?

@aarlt I think this PR should do only the warning part. You can write another PR for the 0.7.0 breaking part, targeting `breaking`.

Needs rebase

@leonardoalt @chriseth @christianparpart I will change this PR so that it will only produce warnings. This means I remove some of the changed tests here, but they will be part `breaking` PR that I will create after this is done here. Sorry, that I didn't thought about the `breaking` things before.

I started reviewing this, but now I'm confused.
The documentation was updated here to allow local variables and also non-public state variables.
Is that correct?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5008794?u=aa5f725afdad81154a79cd5ab6be9340b08da4a9&v=4" width="50">[aarlt](https://github.com/aarlt) commented at [2020-04-27 22:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8532#issuecomment-620275413):

@leonardoalt This PR will enable NatSpec comments on state variables. The NatSpec tags `@dev` and `@notice` are allowed on public state variables. If a state variable is public, it will generate generate a user-doc that will use the `@notice` tag to add the description within the generated getter method `methods`. On non-public state variables, `@notice` is not allowed. But this PR will just generate a warning. It will be forbidden in v0.7.0. On non-public state variables `@dev` will generate a new json node `stateVariables`, where the description defined by the `@dev` tag will be added to the resulting dev-doc - this is also true for `@dev` tags on public state variables.

The documentation needed to be changed here, because the defined non-public state variables only allow the NatSpec tag `@dev`. The compilation tests of examples included in the documentation are failing on warnings, thatâ€™s why it was needed to change the documentation already in this PR.

The test on local variables was added, because NatSpec comments make only sense on state-variables. Also in this case a warning is generated, but it should become an error in 0.7.0.

Another thing was that some contract authors defined `@author` and `@title` within contracts. Because NatSpec on state-variables where just ignored, there was no problem doing this. With this PR the semantic changed, because only `@dev` and `@notice` are allowed, this would result in some not compilable contracts. Thats why in this PR the tags `@author` and `@title` are still allowed on state-variables, but will result in a warning. Also this need to become an error in 0.7.0.

Oh, you where right, `docs/control-structures.rst` is referring to a local variable. I accidentally put `@dev` here too. It should be just a normal comment.

I guess this was the main confusion that was created here.

I accidentally started a "review" on this PR that encapsulated all comments into a batch, that where never released until now. I was not aware of this mechanism. Sorry for this!
