I did move it to it's own job. Tests are passing. Should be good now.

Why did it continue after the syntax error?

Actually the syntax error is still there:

This were file without pragma statement. 
Added print with ifo about that and skipping check for that file.

PR updated

I'll merge this already so that I can rebase the other PR, but could you make one additional change:

The jobs that start with `t_` usually run tests on the compiler itself. Jobs that just test things like the documentation or the coding style start with `chk_`, so I think this should also be called something like `chk_doc_minimum_pragma` or something like that.
