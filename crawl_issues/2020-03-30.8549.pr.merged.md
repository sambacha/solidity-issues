# [\#8549 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8549) `merged`: Removing grammar.txt in favor of Solidity.g4 (ANTLR based grammar)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2020-03-30 09:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8549):

Closes #8521.

I could not find any other trace where the `grammar.txt` was referenced except this one place where I changed the text to point to the `Solidity.g4` file. I also changed the underlying language tag, so I believe it will be displayed in "readthedocs" correctly?
