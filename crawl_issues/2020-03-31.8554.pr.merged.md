Please also add a short description of what this script does and how it is supposed to be used.

What's the number?

@ekpyron the default is `$(command -v -- solc)`.

Is this going to be part of CI or can we merge it like this?

currently its not yet part of CI... probably it would make sense to be able to see how the numbers change over time.. we could at the CI integration later?

I think @chriseth mentioned in a call that we could just run the script locally once in a while instead of constantly via CI.
Can we merge it as is then?

@leonardoalt I would say it could be merged.

@aarlt is anyone occasionally running this and changing the tests to `alsoViaYul: true` where it passes?

@axic what do you mean?

Here's an example: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/accessor/accessor_for_state_variable.sol#L6

This one is set to be compiled with and without the IR. Some others set it to `none.`

Perhaps this script was not designed to also run those inputs?

@axic no the script was not designed for these inputs. The script is just trying to compile all tests with `--ir`, it will determine how many percentage of tests are compilable via Yul.

Maybe we should just change isoltest instead and make tests fail if they work with yul but have yul disabled :)

That's a good idea!
