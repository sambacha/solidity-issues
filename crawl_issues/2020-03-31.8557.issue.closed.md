Most of them seem not to be upgraded to 0.6 yet, though, but we should maybe get in contact.

Looks like [ethregistrar](https://github.com/ensdomains/ethregistrar), [ens](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens) and possibly some other repos got consolidated into [ens-contracts](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts) and all of it seems to be on 0.8.4 now.

In that case just switching the ens ext test to this new repo should solve this.
