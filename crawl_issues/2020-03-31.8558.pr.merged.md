Do you really think this is needed as a CI job?

I think it would help us to write better scripts.

Maybe add it to the style checker instead?

Ah sorry, this is something else than I thought!

But oh wow, this still needs a lot of work :)

Thats true, will do it.

I renamed `chk_shellcheck` to `chk_shellscripts`. `chk_shellcheck` looked to similar to `chk_spellcheck`.

`chk_shellscripts` now executed within `chk_coding_style` job

I'm closing this for now. We should gradually fix issues with the shell scripts, but this script is not too helpful.

@chriseth This script will ensure that all new shell-scripts will be checked with `shellcheck` - why is this not helpful? The only part that is probably "strange" is the part that is responsible to deal with already written shellscripts - here we only have the option to either fix all scripts to activate this, or to have a mechanism that allow us to do this step-by-step. The step-by-step approach is implemented here.

I will just add the `to discuss` label again - so that I don't forget to talk about this. I still think this PR is useful.

Reopening for simplified version that is based on blacklisting.
