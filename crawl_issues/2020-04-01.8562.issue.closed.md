# [\#8562 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8562) `closed`: Debugging info for immutables.

The LinkerObject should contain information about the location of references to and maybe assignments to immutables.

Part of #3835

Is this already done? I see there is 

```
	/// Map from hashes of the identifiers of immutable variables to a list of offsets into the bytecode
	/// that refer to their values.
	std::map<u256, std::vector<size_t>> immutableReferences;
```

in the file

@ekpyron you added that code.. do you know? ^

@Marenz The information is basically already there, but it still needs to actually be part of the debugging output.

The output should be basically like `linkReferences` is done

FYI: The ``immutableReferences`` map for now only uses hashes, so we will also probably have to store the full names corresponding to each hash. The output should tell you for each immutable the offsets of all its occurrences.

Just to clarify: The references should be in the runtime bytecode only, and not in the creation bytecode, right?

Yep

Hm, we should also make both library references and immutable references part of the metadata!

I agree, I was actually surprised that the link references aren't already in there.
