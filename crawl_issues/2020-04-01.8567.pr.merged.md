Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8479#issuecomment-607157207

For the record: I already discussed with @hrkrshnn that we should duplicate all the uninitialized storage return tests while changing the return variables to local variables.

Then we should take a second and have a detailed look at inlined assignments in ternary expressions like ``(flag ? (c = s) : t).f ? c : s`` and verify that the check is correct in all cases just to be sure (it should be fine, since it should also already work and be tested for return values).

@ekpyron @hrkrshnn what about short-circuiting in `if (cond() && (c = s).g())`?

It should be handled correctly, but we should verify that it works and that we have tests for it.

This is fine.

There are two test cases for this, both working well.
1. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8567/files#diff-b0499ee8af31910d65e1e6812b2c52d3
2. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8567/files#diff-120a865a917df5a5893d46cb37c962d5

There are currently two test cases for this.

1. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8567/files#diff-eec6e77523f9619ddf763448adb05ee0
2. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8567/files#diff-fd20687e56296379096a8366c8ff2724

Both working as expected. These test cases are enough, right? @ekpyron

@ekpyron 

I don't have any equivalents for unimplemented_internal.sol, unimplemented_library.sol, assembly_err.sol, and default_location.sol. Can you have a look and see if one can write new cases for these files?

I expect things to be fine, but maybe something like
```
contract C {
    uint256[] s;
    function f() public {
        bool d;
        uint256[] storage x;
        uint256[] storage y = d ? (x = s) : x; // should be an error
    }
}
```
or
```
contract C {
    uint256[] s;
    function f() public {
        bool d;
        uint256[] storage x;
        uint256[] storage y = (x = s)[0] > 0 ? x : x; // should be fine
    }
}
```
just to be sure? What we have might be enough, but it never hurts to have more tests and to spend a bit of time trying to come up with cases that might not yet be covered.

I think ignoring those for this purpose is fine.
