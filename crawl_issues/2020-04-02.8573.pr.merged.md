# [\#8573 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8573) `merged`: [build-system] Add -Wpessimizing-move & -Wredundant-move warnings.

-Wpessimizing-move warns when a call to std::move would prevent copy elision
if the argument was not wrapped in a call.  This happens when moving a local
variable in a return statement when the variable is the same type as the
return type or using a move to create a new object from a temporary object.

-Wredundant-move warns when an implicit move would already be made, so the
std::move call is not needed, such as when moving a local variable in a return
that is different from the return type.

Looks like the used `gcc` doesn't support this. It was introduced with `gcc 9`. We use right now `GNU 8.3.0`, would it make sense to upgrade gcc?

What about just using ``eth_add_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported``? We do have build runs against gcc 9 (e.g. the archlinux run), so we'd still get the reports.

@ekpyron ah nice.  `eth_add_cxx_compiler_flag_if_supported` sounds good
