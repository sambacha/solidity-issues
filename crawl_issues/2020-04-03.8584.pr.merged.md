# [\#8584 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8584) `merged`: Delete copy/move on annotation polymorphic bases to improve safety

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2020-04-03 02:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8584):

As a general rule, polymorphic base classes should have deleted copy/move operations (see Core Guideline [C.67](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-copy-virtual)).

This PR deletes copy/move for `ASTAnnotation`, `StructurallyDocumentedAnnotation`, and `ScopableAnnotation`. This does not currently break any code, and it would prevent slicing in the future. Also gives `ScopableAnnotation` a virtual destructor, which it is currently missing.

This also prevents accidentally copying an annotation out of an ASTNode, which is appears to be not generally intended.
