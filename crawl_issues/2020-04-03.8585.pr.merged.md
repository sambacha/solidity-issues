Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8540

Adds a new error message: Library functions cannot be "virtual". Fixed a gnosis test set that had a library function with virtual.

@chriseth mentioned about doing external tests for this. I'll do that now.

Yeah, the test runs indicate that apparently a virtual library function snuck into ``test/compilationTests/gnosis``, so at least that needs to be fixed.

Can be merged once the failing compilation test is fixed.

@hrkrshnn is this WIP or can it be merged (when the tests pass)?

If this is for breaking, shouldn't the changelog entry go into the 0.7.0 part?

@chriseth Yes it should go to 0.7.0 part, my bad. The current plan is to push it to develop (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8587) and revert the breaking PR (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8588) could you revert the breaking and force push it, for a cleaner history?
