# [\#8586 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8586) `merged`: Disallow external function pointers as immutables.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-04-03 10:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8586):

Since we will have a bugfix release on Monday, I suggest that we temporarily disallow external function pointers as immutables for this release, since there are a few open questions about them:

- Do we actually want to support multi-stack-slot immutables? Assuming that reference types will likely use a ``codecopy`` based approach anyways, this will *only* be external function pointers.
- Instead of making them multi-stack-slot-immutables we could pack external function pointers into single slots like in memory.
- If we keep them as multi-stack-slot immutables the keys in the debugging output will become more complex (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8581) - in particular they will have special cases only for external function pointers.

I'm not necessarily saying that we *should* change how function pointer immutables work, but maybe it makes sense to discuss this some more, so maybe better not to create facts with releasing this as is, but rather disable it for now.
