Ah yeah, and of course the external tests will be quite a hassle on this one... but there's also still test cases in our repository that fail, so we can start with those and look into the external once, once everything else works.

For the external tests: since you now added the repos to https://github.com/solidity-external-tests, you can create either separate branches on them (and fix the syntax there), and change the scripts on the `breaking` branch to use those branches.

@hrkrshnn Do you plan to look into updating the external tests for this one?

@ekpyron  Yes. I'm on it now.

Please rebase.

> Also, did you add a new syntax test that actually uses `.value` and `.gas`?

@chriseth  There is `test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/functionTypes/warn_deprecate_gas_function.sol â†’ test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/functionTypes/error_deprecate_gas_function.sol` and similarly for value.

@chriseth I upgraded the external tests using the new solidity-upgrade.

I originally wanted to set up the new repos (https://github.com/solidity-external-tests) with the latest branches of the original repos and use solidity-upgrade to update the repos. However, it seems that Erik's original upgrade involved a lot of manual changes. Also the regex based approach creates some false replacements, and infinite loops. So except OpenZeppelin and 
dappsys-monolithic none of them are upto date.

Looks good apart from the two test changes.
