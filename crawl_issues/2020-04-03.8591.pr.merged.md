Please rebase.

PR updated, still not complete
Tried to use more `Whiskers` instead of `<<` as it should be much more readable that way

@ekpyron @chriseth PR is updated with new logic for init order

Another stress test for the order:
```
contract A {
  uint public a = 42;
  uint public b;
  uint public c;
  constructor(uint x) public {
    b = a;
    a = x;
  }
  function f(uint x) public returns (uint256) { c = x * 3;  return 23; }
}
contract B is A {
  uint public d = f(a);
  uint public e = b;
  uint public b_a;
  uint public b_b;
  uint public b_c;
  constructor() public A(17) { b_a = a; b_b = b; b_c = c; }
}
```
and check all state variable values...
Or something similar, but a bit less convoluted :-).

That one works, but :
```
contract A {
    uint public x = 0;
    uint y = f();
    function f() public returns (uint256) {
        ++x;
        return 42;
    }
}
contract B is A {
    uint public z;
    constructor() public {
        z = x;
    }
}
// ====
// compileViaYul: also
// ----
// z() -> 1
```
is not working

So, I'll need to make sure to call all initStateVars below contracts that has constructor for all contracts without constructor. With that change, I am pretty sure I covered all cases.

Is it possible to simplify this by using the same generic template for all constructors? Something like this:
```
function <constructor_name>(<params><base_params>)
{
  <eval_base_const_args>
  <next_constructor>(<nextParams>)
  <state_var_init>
  <constuctor_body>
}
```

And then at the outer level, add the call value check and copying the constructor arguments from code to memory.

Maybe it'd also become simpler, if we just generated artificial/implicit constructors even for contracts that don't define an explicit one.

I think in this case I'll need to introduce implicit constructor if there is no user defined. In that case it will be much simpler than before, something like you have suggested

For the name of the constructor, we should use something like `constructor_<contract_id>` and not `m_context.functionName` - this is another reason to use a different template as for regular functions.

PR is updated with another major change and that is introducing implicit constructor if there is no user defined. It made code much more simple.
It is ready for another review
