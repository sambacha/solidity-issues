# [\#8592 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8592) `merged`: Delete copy and move operations for ASTVisitor and ASTConstVisitor

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2020-04-04 04:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8592):

As a general rule, polymorphic base classes should have deleted copy/move operations (see Core Guideline [C.67](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-copy-virtual)).

This PR deletes copy/move operations for `ASTVisitor` and `ASTConstVisitor`. In addition to prevent slicing, this improves safety since it is rarely (if ever) correct to copy a visitor.
