# [\#8607 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8607) `merged`: Fixed nested tuples on the right-hand side.

Fixed moving value types, which occupy more than a single stack slot.

Without the fix, `f3()` and `f4()` in the test were returning 8 and 32 respectively.

Good job!

This will also need a changelog entry. Do we just book it as a regular bugfix or as an important one?
Strictly speaking it can generate wrong code, even though nested tuple assignments are weird and probably not used...

Looks good!

Missing is: buglist entry, changelog.

For considering the severity:

```
contract C {
    function g() public {}
    function f() public returns (uint256, function() external x, uint256 b) {
        return (42, this.g, 21);
    }
    function h() public returns (uint256 a, uint256 b) {
        (a,,b) = f();
    }
}
```
``h`` returns ``3793197966, 21``...

Still "very low" - this is easily testable and rather uncommon, I would say.

Please run the cmdline tests once more.
