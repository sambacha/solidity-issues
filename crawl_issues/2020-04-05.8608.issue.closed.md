# [\#8608 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8608) `closed`: Yul support in Pygments
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Similar to the Solidity version (https://gitlab.com/veox/pygments-lexer-solidity), this would help us to have nice syntax highlighting in the Solidity documentation.

@veox would you be interested in helping out? If so, how could we help you?

Sure, why not.

There's already [some support for `assembly`](https://gitlab.com/veox/pygments-lexer-solidity/-/blob/17cc012c0aae3103bad0d5ee5ed1bd110bf3da71/pygments_lexer_solidity/lexer.py#L66), that one's relatively simple. I don't think Yul will be much ~~different~~ more difficult.

That said: can Yul be used from a Solidity program (similar to Assembly)? Because if yes, then `token['yul'] = token['assembly']` in the existing Solidity lexer is the starting point; and if no, then copy-pasting a `pygments-lexer-yul` might be the approach, or perhaps branching off a `YulLexer` class...

([All the examples](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.4/yul.html) seem to be for standalone use.)

Inline assembly in Solidity **is** Yul, but a different sub/superset.

The main difference, which cannot be represented in inline assembly, is Yul objects currently. See https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.4/yul.html#specification-of-yul-object

Ah, yes, [I see now](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.4/assembly.html).

So what you'd want, essentially, is this:

```
.. code-block:: yul
    
    {
        function power(base, exponent) -> result
        {
            ...
```

Right?

-----

Another thing is that the lexer still has to support previous versions of Solidity, from when Yul didn't yet exist in current form. I.e. `assembly` code with `dupXX`s and `swapXX`s should still be highlighted properly.

Not a big issue, nothing inheritance can't fix. Already working on it.

Yes with it will be used with `code-block` or `highlights`.

It would be nice to also support the Yul object notation I've linked above.

First attempt is now in `pygments-lexer-solidity` v0.5.0 ([just pushed to PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pygments-lexer-solidity/#history)).

Sphinx's `conf.py` will need modification: also importing the `YulLexer`.

Testing it locally, I see that variable declarations with types, e.g.

```
let zero:uint32 := 0:uint32
```

are not done well, since `:` is not matched by anything. This is easy to fix, but I am wondering:

* whether this is the only thing I missed;
* whether this is valid syntax in "inline assembly", including before Yul got the name "Yul".

Would you mind also testing it locally and saying if anything else is wrong? I'd like to not be pushing a release for every one-line change. :)

If the CI supports building docs, I could also submit a PR, so the visuals can be viewed online.

Not sure you're not better suited for the task, though.

FWIW, [v0.5.1](https://pypi.org/project/pygments-lexer-solidity/0.5.1/) with the above fix is out.

@veox yes, the CI builds the docs and also has a preview feature. Could you please create a PR to activate your module?

About the types: Currently, inline assembly does not support types, but it probably will in the future - so it would be good to already activate that feature in the highlighter.
