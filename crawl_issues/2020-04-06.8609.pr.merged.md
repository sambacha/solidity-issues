# [\#8609 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8609) `merged`: Trivial documentation fixes in reference-types.rst

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-06 08:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8609):

Two tiny fixes:
1. The sentence about slices had a space at the beginning of the wrapped line which caused it to be rendered in a weird way (first part bold, second part indented). See how it gets rendered in https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types.html#array-slices.
2. Correction of a small grammatical mistake.
