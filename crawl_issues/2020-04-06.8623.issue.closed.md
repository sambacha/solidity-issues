	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

Using the experimental SMTChecker pragma with a simple contract that defines a storage variable and inherits from another contract results in an error.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.5-develop.2020.4.1+commit.ff23f165.mod.Darwin.appleclang (with support for Z3)
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
```
-->

Compiling the following results in an error:
```
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract B {
  function b() public {}
}

contract A is B {
  uint public x;

  function a() public {
    b();
  }
}
```

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/[redacted]/libsolidity/formal/Z3Interface.cpp(202): Throw in function z3::expr solidity::frontend::smt::Z3Interface::toZ3Expr(const solidity::frontend::smt::Expression &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>

```
