Fixes #8555.

## Example of problem

```cpp
bytes solidity::util::ipfsHash(string _data)
{
	...
	protobufEncodedData += bytes{0x12};
	protobufEncodedData += lengthAsVarint; // move append, after this lengthAsVarint is not valid anymore, because all items where moved out of the container
	...
	protobufEncodedData += bytes{0x18} + lengthAsVarint; // here lengthAsVarint is not valid anymore
	...
}
```

I think I understood now what was happening here, this is my interpretation:

We defined the following functions:
```
/// Concatenate the contents of a container onto a vector
template <class T, class U> std::vector<T>& operator+=(std::vector<T>& _a, U const& _b)

/// Concatenate the contents of a container onto a vector, move variant.
template <class T, class U> std::vector<T>& operator+=(std::vector<T>& _a, U&& _b);
```

The lvalue reference implementation was only used, if `_b` was of constant type. In all other cases the "rvalue reference" implementation was used. In our case it is not always necessarily a rvalue reference. Because of the template parameter, the actual type will be deduced and can bind rvalues and non-constant lvalues. This is quite similar to Scott Meyers "universal references".

So our implementation of the "move variant" was basically an implementation that was able to bind lvalues and rvalues with the exception of constant lvalue references. So the "move variant" function was also called if non-constant lvalues where used. 

By removing `const` from the lvalue reference implementation, we ensure that the rvalue reference implementation can only bind rvalue references and the lvalue reference implementation will only bind to lvalue references.

Can we instead just change
``template <class T, class U> std::vector<T>& operator+=(std::vector<T>& _a, U const& _b)`` to
``template <class T, class U> std::vector<T>& operator+=(std::vector<T>& _a, U& _b)``? Not sure, but might have the same effect, but I'd need to check what has precedence myself in this case.

Since solidity is using C++17, you can use `std::enable_if_t<...>` instead of `typename std::enable_if<...>::type` and `std::is_lvalue_reference_v<...>` instead of `std::is_lvalue_reference<...>::value`.

I just checked - removing the ``const`` from the lvalue ref version and leaving the rvalue version as is should do the trick.
It'll correctly choose the lvalue version for `const&` and `&` (deducing ``U`` as ``const`` or not respectively) and the rvalue version for rvalue references.
If we want an additional safeguard we can add
``
static_assert(!std::is_lvalue_reference_v<U>, "")
``
to the rvalue version.

@random-internet-cat @ekpyron thx for the feedback :)

I use now the c++17 stuff and remove `const` from the lvalue ref version.

@ekpyron thank you soo much for your feedback! It took me a while to fully understand what was happening here, I hope that my interpretation is correct.

Yeah, this is higher C++ dark-magic :-).

I would actually have added the static assertion to the other one to make sure...

Also: what about the other cases in ``CommonData``? We do need to do the same for the set's, etc., don't we?

So @aarlt Can you open a new PR with the rest :-)?
