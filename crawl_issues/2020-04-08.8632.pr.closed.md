Why not a real PR? (just trying to get context)

@leonardoalt This was just done to get the CI run external tests. Doing it locally involves setting up truffle+npm+docker, so doing a PR was easier.

Was this done to check how the mainstream external tests are doing with our latest `develop`?

@leonardoalt Yes. We also plan to move all the external tests to the repos here: https://github.com/solidity-external-tests. This change is more relevant to the following breaking PR: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pulls

Ok, thanks. I'm editing the first comment of the PR with the description you just wrote. It's hard to know what/why it's doing without that.

@hrkrshnn Ah, the second link points to all PRs. Can you edit the first comment with the appropriate one?

@hrkrshnn sorry to keep bugging, but what is the purpose of keeping this PR open? Is it to retrigger CI once https://github.com/solidity-external-tests is done?

@leonardoalt I'll try to close this today after setting up the external-tests. This issue got sidetracked.

The external tests are passing, finally. So closing this.
