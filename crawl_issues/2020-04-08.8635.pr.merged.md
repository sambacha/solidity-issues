Can we please try to keep pull requests like this short-lived? Please try to make a list of tests to add in the issue instead.

Why not merge these tests since they were written already?

I think I did close this a while ago because I didn't feel comfortable enough back in time.
Now, since @axic did reopen it, and s a conclusion from today's meeting, I did a rebase, so we *could* merge the added tests at least.

More tests don't hurt I'd say. We might want to remove the "Fixes" from this PR, though, because I'm not quite convinced that the tests in this PR are enough to just call https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8437 "done" with it...
