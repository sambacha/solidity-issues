## Abstract

Goal is to write a grammar based fuzzer that automatically generates tests like

```
contract C {
  function test() public pure returns (uint) {
    C1 testContract = new C1();
    if (testContract.f() != 1337)
      return 1;
    return 0;
  }
}

abstract contract C2 {
  function f() public pure virtual returns (uint);
}

contract C1 is C2 {
  function f() override public pure returns (uint) {
    return 1337;
  }
}
```

The workflow is
  - Libprotobufmutator generates a new test instance (protobuf based)
  - test instance is translated to Solidity code
  - Solidity code is executed on evmone
  - Output of evmone is asserted to `0`.

## Motivation

Split into following easily reviewable PRs
  - [x] Permit linking libraries in compilation framework used by fuzzer code (#8705)
  - [ ] Add a protobuf specification for inheritance fuzzer and a skeleton converter (#8706 )
  - [ ] Add a test harness for the fuzzer (#8708)
  - [ ] Add an intermediate representation (adaptor) to easily convert from protobuf spec to solidity code

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
