# [\#8640 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8640) `merged`: Encapsulate kind in FunctionCallAnnotation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2020-04-08 17:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8640):

This allows removing the sentinel value in `FunctionCallKind`, meaning other code doesn't have to check for it, which is likely to prevent bugs. It also allows fast-failing on bugs, since accessing `kind` before it has been given a value other than `Unset` is likely to be a bug.

Something similar could probably be done for fields in other annotations, but that is not proposed here in order to keep the diff small and more easily-reviewable.

The test failures in ``chk_proofs`` (and ``t_ems_solcjs``) are unrelated to this PR and should vanish, once you rebase to current develop.

Converted to draft because design discussion is still ongoing.

For the record:
 - Do we want getters and setters and private members in the annotation (might clutter the annotations) or do we want plain public members that may be of ``SetOnce`` type (will require solutions to the issues below)?
 - Do we care if ``auto kind = annotation().kind;`` works? What about ``for(auto const& obj: annotation().someVector)``?
 - For those cases, do we want the unary dereferencing operator ``auto kind = *annotation().kind;`` or ``for(auto const& obj: *annotation().someVector)``? Additionally or in replacement of the implicit conversion? Would this misleadingly suggest that we're *lacking* the internal check?
 - We can also fall back to something like ``annotation().kind.value()`` or ``annotation().kind.get()`` in case implicit conversion is not enough... but that's ugly...

Sorry for the silence; this isn't abandoned. I've just been busy. I can update this when there's consensus on what the design should look like, then I can go through the other annotations and do the same.

Currently my favorite design on this would be to use the dereferencing operator ``*setOnce`` instead of the implicit conversions.

So have the `SetOnce` object be public in the annotations and have `operator*` and `operator->`?

Yep! At least I think that might be nicest and would work everywhere, not sure what you or @chriseth think about it, though.

That design is fine by me. I'll implement it so we can see what the code looks like.

Looks pretty good to me. We might even want to use this for more fields in the Annotation structs?
Should we remove the draft mode for this?

@ekpyron @chriseth what is blocking here?

@random-internet-cat set it to "draft"

Rebased and removed draft status. I'm sorry to have done a disappearing act (again); I just got focused on other projects.

Haha nice, that was quick! Thanks a lot!

Oh, but I think there is a typo somewhere, at least the spellchecker is complaining.

Huh, it thinks "copyable" is spelled wrong, even though that's how the type traits spell it. "Fixed".

@randomnetcat GH won't let me push a rebase directly into your branch, could you rebase? The test failures should vanish then
