This was done to improve readability. See https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5e8ef6473a85536c431ad992 for context

Done automatically, so maybe a thorough review isn't needed.

Need to fix the json files, because it's sorted according to name, so willBeWrittenTo ends up below.

Just to make sure: note that you don't have to update them manually - ``isoltest`` can do that automatically as well.

@chriseth We need a decision about the AST here...

I think changing the json ast is not worth it.

I agree at least for now. We can create a low-priority issue to reconsider changing the json ast for 0.7

I added an issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8699 about making the change in JSON AST for 0.7.0
