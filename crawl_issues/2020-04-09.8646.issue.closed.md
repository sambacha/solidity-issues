```

The resulting binary for the library only has the constructor and the library-call-safety-switch and nothing else.

It could be confusing for developers to have a binary for library when it is not used. The question they may ask -- "Do I need to deploy this?"

Arguably not emitting a binary could be construed as another edge case, since we do emit an empty binary for empty contracts.

"Do I need to deploy this" - the question should be answered by the deployment tool depending on whether the object has link references or not - not by the nature of the library to be linked to.

If you have a non-empty library but never call any of its public functions then you also do not need to deploy the library.

I would propose to close this issue.

At the minimum this should be documented.

Empty contracts also generate bytecode. Libraries with only internal functions also generate bytecode. You need to deploy a library when the linker requests it. This could be documented, but linking is not a feature people use nowadays...

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
