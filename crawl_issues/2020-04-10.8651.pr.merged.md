Inspired by eec1998.

Could also update the `test/evmc/README` to say evmc 7.1.0.

Please note that this update must propagate to the following places, otherwise linux based CIs will continue to use the older `0.4.0`. I am not sure if this is critical but I guess it is good to keep test CIs identical if possible.

I am not sure this list is exhaustive :-)

I guess someone also needs to build+upload the new docker images

I feel like we should try to have only one place where the version is defined and all the others use it.. but the places are so different that it might prove difficult. Maybe a script that does the updating?

I agree. I wonder what alternatives to script exist: perhaps a single base docker file that exports version strings for dependencies? So, one place to update.

Edit: I think the "ease of maintenance" is a separate PR though.

Btw the 0.4.1 release only fixes a build issue for Windows, not sure it is worth the hassle upgrading. We were already using 0.4.0.

@bshastry @axic
I reverted changes from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1, but left changes from 0.3.0.
I used 0.4.0 for CI and 0.4.1 for download links and documentation.

Hello. I did not approve this yet because I wasn't sure having a different evmone version for Windows and Linux may cause problems in the future.

I will create a separate issue (created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8682) to track this before approving.
