# [\#8655 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8655) `closed`: Improve inheritance error messages if the underlying issue cannot really be solved.
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

## Description

Consider 

```
interface I0B {
	function f0() external view
	 returns (uint);
	
}
interface I0BB {
	function f0() external pure
	 returns (uint);
	
}
interface I0 is I0B, I0BB {
}
```

This results in the following error leading one to believe that the basis for "function equality" is function name and parameter types being the same.

```
Error: Derived contract must override function "f0". Two or more base classes define function with same name and parameter types.
  --> t:12:1:
   |
12 | interface I0 is I0B, I0BB {
   | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
Note: Definition in "I0B": 
 --> t:3:2:
  |
3 | 	function f0() external view
  |  ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
Note: Definition in "I0BB": 
 --> t:8:2:
  |
8 | 	function f0() external pure
  |  ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

However, if one were to explicitly add a multiple-base override like so

```
pragma solidity >=0.0;
interface I0B {
	function f0() external view
	 returns (uint);
	
}
interface I0BB {
	function f0() external pure
	 returns (uint);
	
}
interface I0 is I0B, I0BB {
	function f0() external override(I0B, I0BB) pure returns (uint);
}
```

the compiler throws the following error message leading one to question the validity of the earlier error message

```
Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.

Error: Overriding function changes state mutability from "view" to "pure".
  --> t:13:2:
   |
13 | 	function f0() external override(I0B, I0BB) pure returns (uint);
   | 	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Overridden function is here:
 --> t:3:2:
  |
3 | 	function f0() external view
  |  ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

Perhaps, the first error message should say something to the effect that derived interface `I0` is invalid because it is attempting to override two base contract functions that are identically named and that contain identical parameter types but different visibilities.

This holds true for contract inheritance as well. Examples

Case 1: Differing mutability

```
contract CB1 {
        function foo() public pure virtual returns (uint) { return 0; }
}
contract CB2 {
        function foo() public view virtual returns (uint) { return 1; }
}
contract C is CB1, CB2 {
}
```

Case 2: Differing visibility

```
contract CB1 {
        function foo() public pure virtual returns (uint) { return 0; }
}
contract CB2 {
        function foo() external pure virtual returns (uint) { return 1; }
}
contract C is CB1, CB2 {
}
```

In both cases `C` is invalid.

Mixed interface-contract inheritance example with different visibility:

Case 1: Interface and abstract contract bases define namesake function

```
pragma solidity >=0.0;
interface C0B {
	function f0() external view returns (uint);
}
abstract contract C0BB {
	function f0() virtual public view
	returns (uint);
}
contract C0 is C0B, C0BB {
	function f0() external view
	override returns (uint)
	{
		return 0;
	}
}
```

Case 2: Interface and non abstract contract bases define namesake function

```
pragma solidity >=0.0;
interface C0B {
	function f0() external view returns (uint);
}
contract C0BB {
	function f0() virtual public view
	returns (uint) {
            return 1;
        }
}
contract C0 is C0B, C0BB {
	function f0() external view
	override returns (uint)
	{
		return 0;
	}
}
```

I'll put this in the ice box for now.

I'll call this an enhancement - we don't guarantee that the suggests of the compiler always work.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
