# [\#8663 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8663) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] IR function generation queue (refactor)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-14 13:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8663):

Refactors `IRGenerator` to generate code only for functions that actually get called.

Prerequisite for #8485. See description in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8485#issuecomment-611582454.

Status: done (works, passes all tests).

I'm not sure if this will be a issue, but I'm still a bit uneasy about allowing to insert a function again that already has its code generated. If we have `n` functions that all call each other, then the queue will always contain `n` elements (or `n-1`), until we have generated code for all the functions.

Maybe you could check if the function collector already has the function?

Also please squash to a single commit.

I still don't think it's really necessary because the overhead for calls that don't end up generating a function seems pretty small to me. It's probably much less than other operations than happen during AST traversal. If the .sol file being processed already contains `n^2` calls that need to be visited and that number happens to be big, then I don't think that doing `n^2 - n` queue operations will noticeably affect performance. And as far as memory goes, AST will contain `n^2` nodes representing these calls and more so extra `n^2` pointers to function definitions will not be much of a difference.

So in my opinion it's a micro-optimisation and my reason for avoiding it was mostly readability. But that was a bigger concern when the queue was a separate class that did not have access to `MultiUseYulFunctionCollector` - you would have to remember to do this check manually before every `push()`. Now that there is a wrapper over it though (`enqueueFunctionForCodeGeneration()`), there's a single place to put such a check so adding it is much less intrusive. So given that and that you're worried it might be an issue, I'll add it anyway.

Done.

Squashed. Except for `Remove duplicate call to setMostDerivedContract()` which I left separate. It's a trivial change but, as the review comments show, it's not obvious just from looking at the diff that the call can be safely removed and the commit message is there to explain that.

The PR is ready for the next round of review.
