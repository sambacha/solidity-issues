# [\#8664 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8664) `closed`: Recursive struct definitions are only checked at contract-level, not at file-level
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-04-14 16:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8664):

The following compiles without error
```
struct s1 { s2 x; }
struct s2 { s1 y; }

contract C {
    // whatever
}
```

while this one does not:
```
contract C {
    struct s1 { s2 x; }
    struct s2 { s1 y; }
}
```

Any usage of `s1` or `s2` in the first version causes internal errors.

There might be similar bugs elsewhere, so we should check that all structs **and enums** are checked, not only at contract level.
