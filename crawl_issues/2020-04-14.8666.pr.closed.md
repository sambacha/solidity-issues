# [\#8666 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8666) `closed`: Swapped parameters of ErrorReporter::warning(), for consistency

Besides consistency, it makes sense to have `_description` as the last parameter, which can eventually evolve into `_format, _arg0, _arg1, ...`.

If you rebase, the two failing tests should work again

I think `SecondarySourceLocation` should be the last parameter since it's not always used, whereas description is always used.

I agree with @leonardoalt  - it should be the last parameter since it is optional. Can you change `declarationError` instead?

@chriseth @leonardoalt 

Moving `_secondaryLocation` to the end would require changing `declarationError`, `typeError`, `fatalTypeError`, `error`, `fatalError`. Not a big deal, but is it worth? If `_secondaryLocation` is optional, overloads (as now) could be fine.

Imagine we would label `(x,y,z)` points with optional `z`. Would not
`label(x, y, text)` and `label(x, y, z, text)` make more sense than
`label(x, y, text, z=0)` from the user point of view?

IMO semantics is better expressed in the first case, but maybe I miss something.

You started the PR, now you ask if doing it consistently is worth it? :)

I believe I did it consistently, making `_description` the last parameter, always. I am asking if going from one consistency (`_description` last) to another consistency (`_secondarySourceLocation` last) worth the efforts :).

I completely understand that it is nice to have an optional argument last. I just feel that in our concrete case doing so brings some disadvantages. The main disadvantage, IMO, is that it would be hard to extend the reporter with `_formatString, _arg0, _arg1, ...`. Another one is that we do not group semantically similar arguments (`_sourceLocation`, `_secondarySourceLocation`) together.

But we should not discuss it for long. If you all are convinced that making `_secondarySourceLocation` the last argument is still a better thing, I can do it :).

This discussion doesn't seem to be evolving. Since some/most(?) people seem to prefer `SecondaryLocation` as the last parameter, maybe we should leave it as it is.

Closing. Might re-open when reporting functions support formatting (e.g. with **fmtlib**).
