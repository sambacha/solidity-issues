## Description

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C
{
        uint a;
        function f(uint x) public { f(0); f; }
        function g() public { f(1); f(0); }
}
```

throws the runtime error here

probably because the referenced vector member may have been uninitialized because an earlier for loop that was supposed to initialize the said vector was not taken for some reason

@bshastry I can't reproduce it. Can you still?

I can only reproduce it via undefined behavior sanitizer i.e., `CXXFLAGS=-fsanitize=undefined`

Can you check if https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8748 fixes it?
