The automatic ID generated for the function `typeError` within **TypeChecker.cpp**. I would like to make sure that we are on the same page before applying the script to all reporting functions and all files.

Note that for intermediate state some reporting functions have to be in two flavors, with and without ID argument.

Does your script ensure uniqueness so the random numbers don't repeat?

Looks good so far!

Yes, the numbers should be unique. I would also need to adjust the script to generate the next random number. It can be used when a new error is added,

I even thought to check the commit history to make sure the number was not used before, but that might be too much.

Compare these two:
```
m_errorReporter.typeError(2718_uid, _location, "Libraries cannot be inherited from.");
m_errorReporter.typeError<2718>(_location, "Libraries cannot be inherited from.");
```
Which one would you prefer?

The second one looks more readable to me, does not require user-defined literals (search for `<code>` is easy) and emphasizes the fact that the ID is associated with the function call, not with the error itself.

Since there are hundreds of places where we report errors, I am looking for a less intrusive syntax :-).

I think a custom name like `_errorId` is better to search for. We also use `<..>` in whiskers, for example and I could very well imagine a C++-template that uses integers as arguments.

I found no appearance of `<dddd>` with 3 or more digits in our code base. Nevertheless, we can stick to user defined literals.

But should they be function parameters or template parameters? The later might provide better semantic separation, ID represents the place of reporting in the source code, while other parameters represent the error itself.

```
m_errorReporter.typeError(2718_uid, _location, "Libraries cannot be inherited from.");
m_errorReporter.typeError<2718_uid>(_location, "Libraries cannot be inherited from.");
```

Template parameter feels rather weird: A template parameter is used to modify the kind or overall behaviour of the function, but we are just passing an argument.

Semantically, with a template, we would not be passing an error ID to a reporting function, but instead assign the unique ID to the reporting function itself.

But there is another reason to avoid templates. There are a few cases when we create an error message in one place and report the error in another. So it would be logical to pass both the ID and the error message as function parameters.

This will create conflicts all the time. I think we should merge the introduction of the error ids and discuss the rest in its own PR.

Can you combine the first and the third PR (I.e. not introduce the functions and then remove them again)?
