# [\#8681 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8681) `merged`: Add functional map and fold generic functions

Wrote this with @ekpyron yesterday.

I've wanted a `map` function like this for a long time, so here it finally is. Wrote `fold` as well when I noticed I could use that too.
I'm using it in the SMTChecker. Only these 2 instances right now, but there are more that I want to change before/if this gets merged.

Can be reviewed anyway.

So the only thing left here is the naming of `fmap`. There are two things I don't like about `fmap`:
 - it is an abbreviation
 - the abbreviation is built from two synonyms: function and map :)

I meant rather `functional map` :p
But yea, also not too happy with it

Maybe just `apply`?

Yea let's go with `applyMap`
