# [\#8693 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8693) `merged`: Fix inconsistent indentation in scripts/

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-17 14:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8693):

This is **not** reindenting all files to use the same indentation style. Just fixing some of them to stick to the style that is predominant (which is not the same in all files).

I made these changes as a part of #8694 but decided to put them in a separate PR because they add a lot of noise and, unlike #8694, we'll probably want to merge them right away.
