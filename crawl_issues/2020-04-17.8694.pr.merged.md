# [\#8694 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8694) `merged`: Out-of-tree SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-17 14:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8694):

I'd like to propose a change that allows `SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR` to be outside of `REPO_ROOT`. That's how I have it on my machine and everything was fine until I noticed that the command-line tests need to be executed separately from `soltest`. `cmdlineTests.sh` requires `solc` to be in `$REPO_ROOT/$SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR`. I could work around it by using a path with several `..` but being able to set them independently seems more logical.

This might break scripts for users who set `SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR` before running our scripts. We never do it in our repo and this includes the CI scripts (because AFAIK everything related to CI is in the repo). I searched github and virtually all uses of this variable were in `cmdlineTests.sh` copied or forked from here. There was exactly one instance where the variable was used to change the location of the build directory:
- https://github.com/coolparadox/ethereum-gentoo-overlay/blob/master/dev-lang/solidity/solidity-0.6.1.ebuild

Note: This PR depends on #8693. I set it as a base branch to avoid its changes showing up in the diff.
