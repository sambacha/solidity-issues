Maybe we can add it somewhere else as own article/part? For the intro it does seem too much indeed

Hii, @leonardoalt  and @Marenz  
I think you are right, it is more than enough for intoduction but you can edit this and use it somewhere else and also can attach a link for this article in intro for knowing more about Gas.
Thanks

I'm closing the PR since we agreed it's a big too large for the documentation.
The text itself can still be used for some external document.
Please reopen otherwise.
