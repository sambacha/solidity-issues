The PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8644 changes `lValueRequested` to `willBeWrittenTo` in the cpp code. However, the member in JSON AST remains the same. In 0.7.0, apply the change to the JSON AST member.

See https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5e8ef6473a85536c431ad992 for context.

I think we should do this for 0.8, as it is small impact.

I think we should not do it because it is an unnecessary breaking change.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
