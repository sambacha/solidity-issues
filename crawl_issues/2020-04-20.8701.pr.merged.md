# [\#8701 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8701) `merged`: solc option for selecting yul optimisations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-20 10:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8701):

Replaces #8619 (now with the correct branch).

Not finished yet but there are only two things remaining:
- [x] command-line tests via standard JSON
- [x] command-line parameter validation that rejects improperly nested parentheses

I'll mark it non-draft when it's ready for review.

Not yet. I'm planning to get back to it and add the missing stuff when I'm done with the internal library call PR.
