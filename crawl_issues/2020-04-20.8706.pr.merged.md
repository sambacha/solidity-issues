Was a commit merged here instead of rebased?

> Was a commit merged here instead of rebased?

I think what happened was the following:

- This PR is one of many that implements the underlying fuzzer
- The merged PR that you refer to was rebased on this PR because it depended on this
- The merged PR also targeted this branch and not `develop` for the same reason
- @chriseth approved and merged that PR and that resulted in new code ending up here
- But @leonardoalt you can ignore the new code since it has been approved

If this was confusing, please let me know how I can raise multiple PRs for a single feature in the future.

@leonardoalt I've addressed your last batch of comments. Please let me know if you think it requires further changes.

No worries :-) I manually merged the changes back into this PR. And since that has already been reviewed, it made this review hopefully easier
