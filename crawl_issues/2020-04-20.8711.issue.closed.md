## Description

This contract:
```solidity
contract C {
    function h() internal pure returns (uint, uint) { return () = h();  }
}
```

produces:

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/home/user/solidity/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp(1297): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::TypeChecker::checkExpressionAssignment(const solidity::frontend::Type &, const solidity::frontend::Expression &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Array sizes don't match and no errors generated.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Array sizes don't match and no errors generated.
```

when compiled with solc

On master, using AFL fuzzing.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer, now with a few more mutation operators

Looks similar to some closed bugs...

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.6.7-develop.2020.4.20+commit.41ef1312.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

Thank you for the bug report @agroce 

I believe this is a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8277#issuecomment-607936250

Perhaps your input is another way of triggering the ICE.

Hmm, yeah, I searched for the line involved, but code churn has presumably moved it.  The inputs are awfully different, though...

Ok, the odd thing here is there aren't any arrays around, not even bytes32 or anything, right?

@agroce tuples are a special kind of arrays for the parser.
