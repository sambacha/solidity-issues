### What I Did
1. Add a dark mode to the documentation
2. Fix some minor issues with formatting that I found while verifying that the dark mode is implemented correctly.

### How I Did It
#### Dark Mode
* `docs/_templates/versions.html` replaces the builtin sphinx template's version selection area in the bottom left. I abbreviated "Read the Docs" to "RTD" and added a slider that toggles day/night here.
* `docs/_static/css/toggle.css` applies the stylesheet for the toggle button
* `docs/_static/css/dark.css` is the stylesheet for dark mode.
* `docs/_static/js/toggle.js` is the JavaScript that implements the toggle. Initially the docs are displayed using the default ("day") style. On the first toggle, `dark.css` is loaded and applied. The active mode is stored in `localStorage` so it will persist across sessions.
* in `docs/conf.py`, some settings are modified to ensure all of the above files are included when rendering.

#### Formatting
* Fixed some code highlights that were implemented with markdown syntax (single backtick) instead of RST (double backtick). In RST, these render as italics rather than code highlights.
* In cases where the intention was italics, changed backticks to asterisks. This has the same effect with (in my opinion) a clearer intent.
* Removed trailing colons in places where sphinx applies code directive formatting, and so the colon is redundant.

### Example
* To see the toggle mechanism in action, visit the [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) documentation.
* The syntax highlighting uses [Monokai](https://monokai.pro/) as implemented by [Pygments](https://pygments.org/docs/):

Ah, I see, the file is indeed needed.

I'll merge - it works on brownie, so it also should here. Thanks again!
