Sorry, can you change the commit message to reflect ripemd160+ecrecover too ?

ecrecover and ripemd are still disabled in `appendExternalFunctionCall` because they still need some more code.

You mean they are disabled through some of the encoding assertions?

No, through function kind assertion.

I'm blind but can't see it. Which line is it?

At the very end - not the best place, but it was already there :)

Ah found it. Actually there are two assertions for ecrecover. This is rather confusing, glad we clarified :wink:
