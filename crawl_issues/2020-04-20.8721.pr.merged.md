# [\#8721 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8721) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Calls to internal library functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-20 21:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8721):

Part of the implementation for #8485. Implements direct calls to internal functions from libraries. Does **not** implement:
- Calls via pointers
- Calls to library functions bound to types (`using` directive)

The above were marked as unimplemented where possible and will be added in separate PRs.

What do you mean by "calls via pointers"? It should only be possible to call internal library functions directly.

Ah wait a second - maybe not :) I'll review the PR first :)

Please rebase.

Yeah, I know, I pushed it before realizing that `develop` has moved on. I already rebased locally but now I'm updating my branch to still work on top of changes that went in.

I have enabled three extra tests using `viaYul` since they pass on top of this PR.

Looks like my PR does not pass CI due to memory leaks but the errors are exactly the same as in #8695 so it's probably just the one @Marenz and @mijovic are fighting with right now.

Can you remove enabling of the tests for now, so we can merge it? The PR by @mijovic will anyway enable all tests that can be enabled.
