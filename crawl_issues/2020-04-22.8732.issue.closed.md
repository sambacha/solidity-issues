@yoni206 mentioned that Boolector can solve many of those tests with BV256, so we should try that as well

This shouldn't be hard using `pysmt`, that has a backend for both Boolector and z3 (and others). However, these "no-overflow" operators that you are using would need to be encoded as I don't see them in pysmt.

Oh right, that sounds good.
Yea, I think they are z3 specific

Boolector supports overflow operators, in particular for signed and unsigned addition, multiplication and division. Not via SMT-LIB, but via the API and the BTOR format.

Also supported via the python api of Boolector?

Hi @leonardoalt, are you still planning on using Boolector (or probably better, bitwuzla) for these benchmarks?

Hi Yoni, in general it'd be good, but it's not high priority for us since these benchmarks have low traffic, and it conflicts with capacity.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
