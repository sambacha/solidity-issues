Also noticed https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/01/security-alert-solidity-variables-can-overwritten-storage/ was followed by an update https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/09/analysis-storage-corruption-bug/, but we don't have that listed (since there's a single "link" field).

Also mentioned this in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/issues/37
