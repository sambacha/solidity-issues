# [\#8741 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8741) `merged`: [BREAKING] solidity-upgrade dot syntax for gas and value

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8700

Uses libsolidity to understand context and then use regex to replace `.gas(...)` and `..value(...)` syntax to `{gas: ...}` and `{value: ...}.`

1. Note that replacements are done using `regex_replace` and therefore not perfect. An example of bad input is `f.value /* a comment */ (5)()`
2. This code (with argument `--module dotsyntax`)  was tested on external tests (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8589)
3. I modified some existing `regex_replace` calls to avoid infinite loops, when regex match doesn't occur. This was happening while running on external-tests.

Does it need a changelog? There aren't any references to solidity-upgrade in the current changelog.

> I couldn't infer from the code, how does it work if both `gas` and `value` are used? Since the regex is applied at different steps, does it overwrite the previous one?

If used in the same line, only one of them will be fixed, e.g., `f().gas(2).value(3)()` will be converted to `f(){gas: 2}.value(3)()` and after that, the user will be asked manually fix the rest.

I think it looks good, just wondering if it would make sense to try to fix the case when both are there. I guess not too important
