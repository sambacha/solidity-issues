Currently I am using this function to decode the selector:

```
    /**
     * @dev get sig of abi encoded call
     * @param _data abi encoded data
     * @return sig (first 4 bytes)
     */
    function abiGetSig(bytes memory _data) private pure returns(bytes4 sig){
        assembly {
            sig := mload(add(_data, 0x20))
        }
    }
``` 

This should be a built in feature of the `abi.` library as `abi.getSig(bytes memory calldata)` or `abi.getSelector(bytes memory calldata)`, or some other way of dealing with calldata incoming through parameters (useful for approveAndCall of MiniMeToken and other).

I would propose: `abi.selector(bytes memory)` and `abi.selector(bytes calldata)`.

Didn't we had this topic discussed under some other PR?

I'd however suggest `abi.decodeSelector` to be in line with the API we have.

It is arguable if an actual decoding is performed there...

Although it would revert if the argument is shorter than 4 bytes.

I'd assume `abi.selector` is a type or a way to create a selector, if I weren't familiar with the API.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
