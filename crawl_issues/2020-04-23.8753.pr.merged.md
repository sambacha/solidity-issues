The output of `SourceReferenceFormatterHuman::printSourceLocation()` was one space off for power of 10 lines:

```

Aren't there any kind of (CLI) tests for the formatter?

@axic the error has to be exactly on line 10, 100, 1000, etc.

Yep, but can't we add such a test case? :)

I added https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/8717c073a67d1a7f44cb61a78df15e6be5de1927#diff-ab19375bc1ce16963b176de45d9b2a1d

Not sure about 523460d. Our current colorization is not accurate towards whitespaces. A bit like
```
This is<em> important\n</em>
vs.
This is <em>important</em>\n
```
Difference in not visible though, unless the background color is set. (There are also some limitations of the current colorization utilities, which are not very handy to paint a part of a line.)

Here is an illustration of the change:
