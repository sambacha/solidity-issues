#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-04-25 18:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8772):

Currently in the ABI there are two kinds of "bytes" types: fixed-length bytes (1 to 32 bytes, `bytes1` to `bytes32`) and dynamic-length bytes (`bytes`).

There is a reason for this: since the ABI operates on 256-bit width elements, fixed-length bytes can be encoded in-place, while dynamic ones are encoded as an offset in-place and followed by 256-bit aligned data.

However, in many of the use cases, contracts use dynamic bytes *only* because they need a longer than 32-bytes field, but they don't expect that field to be dynamically sized. Therefore they resort to introducing `require` statements to ensure the inputs are of valid size. I expect these use case to increase in numbers with the BLS12-* curves picking up users (since they have larger keys).

Thus here is a proposal to introduce language support for this: `bytes(N)` marks fixed-size, but dynamically encoded fields. The ABI decoder would check and reject input at the time of decoding.

Alternatively we could accept arbitrary length (N) as a keyword `bytesN`, but that I think would introduce too much complexity on the parser.

Question: is the `bytes(N)` syntax too confusing? Any other ideas?

Example use case (syntax 1):
```solidity
interface IDepositContract {
    function deposit(
        bytes(48) calldata pubkey,
        bytes32 withdrawal_credentials,
        bytes(96) calldata signature,
        bytes32 deposit_data_root
    ) external payable;
}
```

Example use case (syntax 2):
```solidity
interface IDepositContract {
    function deposit(
        bytes48 calldata pubkey,
        bytes32 withdrawal_credentials,
        bytes96 calldata signature,
        bytes32 deposit_data_root
    ) external payable;
}
```

Example use case (syntax 3):
```solidity
interface IDepositContract {
    function deposit(
        bytes{length=48} calldata pubkey,
        bytes32 withdrawal_credentials,
        bytes{length=96} calldata signature,
        bytes32 deposit_data_root
    ) external payable;
}
```

This could potentially also help the SMTChecker, at least there would be no need for extra require statements from the user.

I like this proposal and I prefer syntax 2 :)

It would be great if we could stick to the fixed-size array notation, but maybe this is misleading because of the packed encoding.

The benefit of syntax 3 could show if we introduce `min`/`max` lengths in the future:
```
bytes{length=48} calldata message;
bytes{min=10} calldata message;
bytes{max=100} calldata message;
bytes{min=10, max=100} calldata message;
```

Don't have a use case at hand, but potentially there are use cases.

names of ABI types and how the are named in a language that uses ethereum abi are two different things :)

There is a pretty good correlation right now.

It'd be cool if this could just be how ``byte[N]`` works (following @chriseth's comment above), but unfortunately we probably can't just break that ... even though I think it unlikely anybody ever uses ``byte[N]`` now, for it being *not* packed...

Hmmm... or can we break that :-)? We could say that ``bytes1[N]`` is still padded and we could start warning about ``byte[N]`` in 0.6 and changing its semantics in 0.7... actually we could even abandon ``bytes`` in favour of ``byte[]`` that way, then we can be sure people would notice the change :-)... but yeah, not sure...

I haven't considered breaking changes, hence the above three syntactical options.

If we consider breaking changes it would be nice to overhaul fixed-size arrays.

If we are making a breaking change we could consider reusing the range/slice syntax:
```
bytes[48] calldata message; // exactly 48 bytes
bytes[10:] calldata message; // minimum 10 bytes
bytes[:100] calldata message; // maximum 100 bytes
bytes[10:100] calldata message; // minimum 10 bytes, maximum 100 bytes
```

Question: would it only be multiples of ``32`` or would there be e.g. ``bytes33`` (in whatever syntax)? If the latter, then how wide would ``bytes33`` actually be? 64 bytes and abi decoding ensures the last 31 to be zero?

Depending on that and *if* we want to go down a breaking path, we could actually even consistently replace bytes1..bytes32 by ``byte[1]...byte[32]``...

Note that @ekpyron  did not suggest a breaking change: `byte` is not a type known to the ABI, only `bytes1` is.

We could use `byte[N]` while it translates to `bytesN` in the abi if `N<=32` and `byte[N]` otherwise.

It's not breaking the ABI, but it's breaking the syntax, isn't it? Because so far ``byte[N]`` is a synonym to ``bytes1[N]``...

Sure, but breaking changes in Solidity are comparatively easy to do and we could still use `bytes1[N]` in Solidity, although I don't think that anybody would...

Alright, nice, if we're open to break the current ``byte[N]``syntax  in solidity, then so far I'd vote for doing that! In case we agree on that, there's a few things to iron out, though... should we keep ``bytes1..bytes32``? Do we need that for the ``bytes1[N]`` workaround to get the old behaviour? Could that instead be ``byte[1][N]``? Will we support ``byte[N] x = 0x12...FF`` for ``N > 32`` and with longer literals? Will ``byte[]`` replace ``bytes``? And not sure that's even all questions :-).

DId someone analyze in which way fixed-size byte arrays longer than 32 bytes would still "look like" value types or are they reference types?

In terms of the ABI, is there a reason for limiting the size of fixed-size byte arrays?

It seems like developers would be better off using fixed-size byte array fields larger than 32 bytes here.

In Fe, we currently [allow for this](https://github.com/ethereum/fe/blob/974efcf59c30c056ea4e65161695866fe2cdb51c/compiler/tests/fixtures/guest_book.fe#L1) and encode the data as a fixed-size value. I actually wasn't aware of the size limitation until very recently. Our tests weren't even failing because the [library](https://github.com/openethereum/ethabi) we're using for encoding/decoding values ignores this part of the spec.

As part of the [verkleization](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-verkle-tree-scheme-for-ethereum-state/5805) storage slots will be laid out differently, to also aid witness design. The change means that the lowest 8-16bits of the storage key (the input to `SLOAD`/`SSTORE`) would not be hashed, and consecutive keys are laid out next to eachother.

It would be nice for contracts to make use of this. Luckily [it seems](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/internals/layout_in_storage.html) that value types and static-length arrays would already benefit from this change, as they are consecutively stored. Dynamic types, including `bytes` and `string`, would not benefit.

However the type discussed in this issue could be stored like static arrays and allowing to benefit from this new storage scheme.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Is this still something you are looking to add?
