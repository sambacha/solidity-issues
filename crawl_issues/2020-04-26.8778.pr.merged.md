# [\#8778 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8778) `merged`: Use Yul lexer in docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3036030?v=4" width="50">[veox](https://github.com/veox) opened issue at [2020-04-26 10:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8778):

Update `pygments-lexer-solidity` dependency in docs, so Yul can be highlighted separately from Solidity.

This changes all instances of `code` to `code-block` in `yul.rst`, with explicit language specification; `highlight` is intentionally not used. See commit a481ea719f901071a04a9282e102a39d6c7c4b5d for reasoning.

Closes #8608 as implemented.

Note:

[`code` is a generic reStructuredText's directive](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#code); and [Sphinx promotes `code-block` instead](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html?highlight=code-block#directive-code-block); and `code` isn't even mentioned in Sphinx's docs - although it's included, and "works", but differently than `code-block`; [quite confusing to dig through](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/2155) while figuring "why X isn't working".

Thanks! I was considering changing all the random uses of `code`/`code-block` to `highlights:`. What do you think?

That would work, although I'm not sure that's the intended use. IDK really, no strong opinion.

... Or it might not, if `highlight` doesn't understand `none` - see next comment.

Ah, `peg` [became available in `pygments` v2.6](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/#pygments.lexers.grammar_notation.PegLexer), but the doc builder [uses v2.3.1](https://circleci.com/gh/veox/solidity/62?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link).

That's a shame, it looked nice. Guess `none` it is then. :(

-----

Argh! That [didn't work](https://circleci.com/gh/veox/solidity/83?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link):

```
Warning, treated as error:
/root/project/docs/yul.rst:430:Cannot analyze code. No Pygments lexer found for "none".
```

Trying `code-block` instead of `code`: that's where I [picked up `none` from](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.7/markup/code.html#directive-code-block).

-----

An alternative would be to build the docs in a `virtualenv`, but that's outside the scope of the PR.

The `doc`-job failings keep happening because of disparities between my local Sphinx (v3.0.2) and what CI is using (v1.8.5).

I'll try to fix it silently, and rewrite the PR description.

-----

For the `b_osx` failure, we'll have to wait until after May 3 (my free-tier plan [broke CircleCI](https://status.circleci.com/incidents/v1wlxwxxr2v9), apparently :laughing:), or someone with a better plan will have to take over, because I've expended my MacOS X limit.

Unsquashed git history in [this branch of mine](https://github.com/veox/solidity/tree/use-yul-lexer-in-docs-unsquashed).

This ended up more difficult than expected; but is now otherwise "done".

I'll poke CircleCI in a week for the `b_osx` job if no one gets there first.

-----

Also, I'd now really advise against using `highlight` for code blocks. I've never seen anyone do it, and I wouldn't wish figuring out why on anyone.

I'll push this over to a branch in the Solidity repo to get a macos run

Actually, b_osx is fully unrelated to this.

Thanks a lot for your help!
