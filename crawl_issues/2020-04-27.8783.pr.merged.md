# [\#8783 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8783) `merged`: [BREAKING] Removed null members from JSON output

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7897

Members with value `null` are removed by recursively going through the JSON representation and removing such members.


TODO
1. [x] What about null inside arrays? I think `arrayValue: [null]` and `arrayValue: []` are different, so currently arrays can have null as members.

@Marenz I thought about this, but a problem is that are at least 100 such instances, and they are not uniform. Such a change would be tedious to make and also to review. I agree that this is the right thing to do, but now fixing it like this is probably not worthwhile.

The issue isn't time-critical or even an active problem for ppl, so if we fix it like this we'd just have to properly fix it at a later time. I agree it's tedious, though maybe we don't have to do all of it in one go either.. Not sure...

Needs rebase

@leonardoalt any opinion on the discussion above?

I agree that constructing it with `null` in the first place only to remove them later sounds awkward. However, adding 100 tiny `if`s to protect from that doesn't sound ideal to me either...

null inside arrays is fine, there is no way to replace them by anything else.
