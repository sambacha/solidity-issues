## Description

This is to record a bug in solidity-upgrade ([context](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8741/files#r415719390)) It creates incorrect placement of overrides.

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.0.0;

interface ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) virtual external;
}

contract OneTxPaymentFactory is ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) external {
      require (1 == 1);
  }
}
```
Upgrade generated by `solidity-upgrade`. (See the extra `override` after `require`.)

```solidity
pragma solidity >0.0.0;

interface ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) virtual external;
}

contract OneTxPaymentFactory is ExtensionFactory {
  function deployExtension(address _colony) override external {
      require (1 == 1) override;
  }
}
```

### Notes
1. This appeared while trying to upgrade [ColonyNetwork.](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork)
2. Low priority since solidity-upgrade is mostly an internal tool and fixing this isn't so important.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
