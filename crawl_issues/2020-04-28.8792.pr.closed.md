# [\#8792 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8792) `closed`: Fixed bug when two empty NatSpec comments led to scanning past EOL

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8789

The problem was that the scanner was not prepared to see `\n` character after the second `\\\` line. It assumed the `\n` character was part of the comment, advanced, and kept reading comments until the next `\n` (therefore creeping into the next line.)

```solidity
\\\
\\\
function f()
```
In the above example, `function f()` was considered as part of the comment.

@chriseth I was planning to fix only https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8789 in develop and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8794 in breaking.

Both of them needs to be fixed in breaking, I think. Because for current `develop`, following code has `StructuredDocumentation` attribute `"\n\n  /// @author x"` instead of `\n\n @author x`

```solidity
contract C{
  ///
  ///
  /// @author x
  function f() public{
  }
}

```

This should go to breaking. Closing this PR (replaced by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8800)

@hrkrshnn as a remark: it is possible to change the "merge base branch" which avoids the need to create new PRs for the same change.
