# [\#8797 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8797) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Populating internal dispatch on demand

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-04-28 19:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8797):

Resolves #6788. Adds a mechanism necessary to implement code generation for internal library function calls via pointers in #8485.

~This is not a perfect solution because internal functions that are called directly rather than assigned to variables are still included in the internal dispatch. That's because generator treats both of these cases the same way, by storing function ID in a variable, and in the case of a direct call the variable is simply not used. I would have to detect that which is not easy and probably not even desirable. So I did not implement it and only functions that are never referenced at all will be skipped. It's still an improvement and it's the minimum needed for #8485.~ Edit: the mechanism has been changed and now functions that are called directly are detected and not included in the internal dispatch.

~The PR is not finished yet. Stuff that's missing:~
- [x] ~Docstrings for all new functions~
- [x] ~`semanticTests/viaYul/array_function_pointers` fails. Turns out that internal dispatch should be generated even if it's empty because calling an empty function pointer is a runtime error, not a compile-time one.~
- [x] ~I did not check the case of function pointers being initialized in constructor (as pointed out in the issue), but I suspect it's already handled.~

Status: **working on requested changes**
- [x] Get rid of excessive docs and reword in some places.
- [x] Minor changes to helpers and `internalDispatch()` in `IRGenerationContext`.
- [x] Generate dispatch functions even if they're not called - to simplify implementation.
- [x] Use `visit(FunctionCall)` to avoid having to add and remove candidates for dispatch.
- [x] ~Put dispatch generation in a separate class if it's still too complex after changes above.~

Moving it out of draft status. Not ready for another review yet though :) Still working on it.

Ready for another round of review. I think I fixed all the issues that were pointed out here and on gitter. The implementation is now much simpler. I have also extracted all the refactoring changes into a separate PR (#8943).

This is now based on #8952 which is the last in a series of PRs which replaced #8943.

Looks like the tests need to be retriggered. I'll be rebasing it when the PRs below get merged anyway so the tests will run then.

I had to rewrite the code in `IRGenerator` and `IRGenerationContext` to match changes requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8951#discussion_r427633806.

Regarding https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8951#discussion_r427633806, I think I found a neater way to organize this code. I moved `generateInternalDispatchFunctions()` to `IRGenerator`. I think it's the right place for it. Now context prepares the dispatch map and the generator does all the generating.

Also, this PR is now again on top of #8952.
