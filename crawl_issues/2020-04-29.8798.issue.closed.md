See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2136#issuecomment-559196297:
> Since we have type(Holder).creationCode, how about adding type(Holder).calculateSaltedAddress(salt) ?

How about this:

```solidity
type(Holder).calculateAddress{salt: bytes32(0), deployer: address(this)}(param1, param2);
```

This would be great to have. 
An alternate format (which requires deployer to be specified):

```solidity
type(Holder).calculateAddress(bytes32(0), address(this),(param1, param2));
```

This syntax more resembles the "encodeCall" syntax.

But either implementation is FAR better to the current WORKAROUND implementation:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Create2.sol";

return Create2.computeAddress(bytes32(salt), keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
                type(Holder).creationCode,
                abi.encode(param1, param2)
            )), address(this));
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
