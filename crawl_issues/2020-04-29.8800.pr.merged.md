Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8794, Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8789, Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8820
### Change
For singleline and multiline docstring comments, empty comment strings (except the first one) does not add `\n` character to the structured documentation text. This is because `DocStringParser::parse()` replaces every `\n` character (except the first one) with a space which shows up in the parsed tag.

Will rebase.

Why is this breaking?

@axic I would say mainly because it changes the behaviour of unicode newlines in `///`-comments. Previously, they were not terminating the comment, if I see that correctly.

@axic The issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8794 was considered as breaking. I think this can also go to develop because it only fixes edge cases that are unlikely to be used, but breaking is a safe option.

I asked the question because IIRC a somewhat similar issue, #4885, was merged as a non-breaking change (due to the being a security risk).
