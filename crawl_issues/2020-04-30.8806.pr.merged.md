@leonardoalt Because, I'm not entirely sure if it shoud go to develop. It may break any application that takes input from `solc --userdoc` Also there is a similar issue (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8800) that @chriseth mentioned should go to breaking.

Also the output of JSON AST will change. So breaking makes sense.
