# [\#8809 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8809) `closed`: Implement subroutines for yul functions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-04-30 14:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8809):

Problems with block deduplicator:
 - [ ] it might unify a beginsub tag with a regular tag
 - [ ] it might unify tags and thus turn a sub-internal jump into a cross-sub-jump

It might make sense to run the block deduplicator on subroutines in isolation.
