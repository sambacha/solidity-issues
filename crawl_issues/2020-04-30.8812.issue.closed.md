To make debugging, analysis and formal verification easier, it would be useful to be able to automatically extract the location of arguments given to functions. 

For value types, this is not very difficult: the arguments will be directly on the stack in reverse order; but for reference types, it is not as straightforward to find this.

Would it be possible to provide this information as compiler metadata?

Would it be fine to add this information to a joint json struct that also contains the storage layout of state variables? Basically some kind of extensible "debug info"?

Yeah, that would be great, I think

Now that [ethdebug spec](https://github.com/ethdebug/format) is in progress, I think this should be redirected there.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
