# [\#8816 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8816) `closed`: Hex literals don't work in assembly/Yul
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35589221?v=4" width="50">[haltman-at](https://github.com/haltman-at) opened issue at [2020-05-01 04:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8816):

## Description

The Yul specification says that there are `hex'...'` literals, but in fact such literals do not work.  Using hex literals will cause a `ParserError: Literal or identifier expected`.  This is true regardless of whether single or double quotes are used.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.6
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.6;

contract HexTest {
  function test() {
    assembly {
      pop(hex"00")
    }
  }
}
```

The main difference between `hex` literals and `0x` literals could be the alignment. If we are set that `0x` literals are numbers and `hex"..."` literals are left-aligned "numebers", then we should add that.

Yes, that was how I had inferred it to work, given that in Solidity hex literals are essentially a different form of string literals, and in Yul string literals are left-aligned.

Meeting discussion: This is too confusing, we should just disallow such literals in the inner assembly (it is still fine to have it for the data part of yul objects).

Well, noting that they're mentioned in the documentation, so if they're not being added then they should be removed from there!
