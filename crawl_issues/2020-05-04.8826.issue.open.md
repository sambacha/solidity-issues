# [\#8826 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8826) `open`: Change ``setimmutable`` Yul builtin to reference code object, or use special ``codecopy`` version that does the replacement..
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8583#discussion_r419307365

It might be nice to generalize ``setimmutable``, resp. reduce the assumptions it makes. Two options came up so far:

Use additional arguments for the memory offsets of the code to-be-modified and the name of the code object in ``setimmutable``:
```
setimmutable(0 /* memory offset of code to be modified */, "<object>", "<immutableName>", <var>)
```
Or introduce a new variant of ``codecopy`` that implicitly replaces the immutables - however I'm not sure how this would specify the immutable values - would it take a long list of arbitrary arguments? Would it specify a memory area and an order in memory?

Staging this for consideration for 0.9. It's not crucial, so we might just bump it anyways, but it'd be nice to properly rework the immutable mechanism on the Yul level. Might also come up in the context of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13723, although that may also work with the current design.
