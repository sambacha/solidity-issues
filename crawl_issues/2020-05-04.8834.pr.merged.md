# [\#8834 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8834) `merged`: Free functions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-05-04 16:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8834):

Experimental PR to allow functions at file-level.

Refers to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8787

As an extension, we could also allow `using * for uint;` or `using FileName.* for uint;` to allow binding functions to types in the same way as we bind internal library functions to types.

TODO:
 - [x] some more semantic tests
 - [x] documentation
 - [x] changelog entry

Test ideas:
- Pointers to free functions (calling them, storing them in variables).
- Calling a free function from a constructor.
- Assigning a free function pointer to a storage variable in a constructor and calling it via that pointer from another function of that contract.
- Handling internal and external function pointers inside free functions.
- Trying to call a private contract or library function from a free function.
- Passing in parameters that take multiple stack slots (e.g. external function pointers).
- Using `selfdestruct` in a free function.
- Applying a modifier to a free function.
- Trying to get a selector of a free function.
- Declaring a free function without body.
- Calling an internal contract function from inside that contract when there's a free function with the same name.
- Free function with the same name as a struct or an enum.
- Free function with dots in the name.
- Free function called `pragma()`, `contract()`, `library()`, `interface()`, `struct()`, `enum()` or `import()`.
- Free function called `gas()`.
- Recursive call of a free function.
- Trying to bind a free function with `using for`.
- Triggering events from free functions.
- Using `try .. catch` or `revert()` in free functions.
- name clash between free function and function in contract
- name clash between free function and function inherited from a contract from a different file
- should free functions be able to use `.value()`?

If we want that, I would remove the requirement for a visibility for free functions and set it to `internal`.

Because `annotation().scope` is only available after reference resolution, some things get a bit more difficult. I think it would be better if the parser already specifies that the function is a free function.

Rebased and fixed. Thanks for the test suggestions, @cameel 
I incorporated some of the suggestions, but most of them are really not too test-worthy, I think. The code generator just works on the compilation queue and emits code for whatever needs code emitted, and it works the same whether the function is defined inside a contract or not. Since we have the same thing already for internal library functions, it does not add much value. For example, `selfdestruct` works the same way as it works in contracts and internal library functions.

Removed the assertions in the constructor of FunctionDefinition in AST.h again because the conditions are actually not enforced by the parser.

The last commit should be squashed.

Squashed the "to be squashed" commit.

The `new_operator` test already calls a function on a contract. Will add recursion test and the calldata / storage reference test.

Updated.

There are a few items from the `test ideas` (first comment) that are not in the tests. Do you still want to add those, or fine without?

The thing is that free functions and internal library functions are really the same thing, so I would say we are pretty safe not adding so many tests. I will add another test that uses free functions via imports.

Yea, that's also what I thought. There is already a test that uses imports though
