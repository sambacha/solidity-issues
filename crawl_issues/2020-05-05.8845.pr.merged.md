Apart from this the only missing cleanup should be memory read/write, which I'll handle in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8824

Yep, saw it... but it's a weird failure :-). It's one of the tests ``isoltest`` changed to ``compileViaYul`` - but for some reason it now fails, but only on homestead... need to look at it...

I have had the same problem before. It does work in isoltest, but stil it outputs the warning, and soltest_all runs yul optimizer which fails if there is warning in compilation...
