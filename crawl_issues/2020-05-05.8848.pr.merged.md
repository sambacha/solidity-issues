Missing:
- [x] CVC4 `tuple_constructor`
- [x] smtlib2 `tuple_constructor`
- [x] Rerun tests then

Apparently what happens in those tests is that z3 times out and CVC4 solves it. I think they should be updated to my latest run with both solvers... maybe I should set them as cvc4 only

Because the CI version might not be running z3, so it doesn't get the error message for it timing out

> Hm - I'm not sure I understand this entirely, but I'd go on a leap and trust you that this works on this one :-).

Re this (GH didn't let me respond there):
If we only assign `index() = foo`, it only assigns the SSA index of the `SymbolicVariable`. However, `SymbolicFunctionVariable` and `SymbolicArrayVariable` have extra `SymbolicVariable`s as members, so they need to relay that assignment to their members as well. That's why I made it a function.

@ekpyron updated with suggestions.
Tests still failing because of the static/dynamic z3 stuff

@ekpyron wait, the `push`/`pop` warning is still there

You mean the assertion of the member name? Yes, I figured out why it's not triggered and I think it's fine, so we can keep it. I commented about it and resolved the conversation about it. Or do you mean something else?

EDIT: ah, now I saw your comment about that. If you still want to change that, go for it, but it's also fine as it is.

Ok, if it's fine as it is I'll avoid rerunning all the tests.
