Needs rebase.

We're missing syntax tests for the errors corresponding to this I think. I'll add some. Based on those we should make double-sure that this really won't seriously break anything :-)!

Now the Sol->Yul part is extracted and there are more and better tests.

This is either a breaking change or an important bugfix, I would say :)

Yep, true - I'm not entirely sure which of the two :-).

Argh... always with the changelog conflicts... that's really annoying :-). I'll move it to "Important Bugfixes" for now, then that won't happen again that often at least.

We could also decide only to do this with ``sol->yul``... and not at all for old codegen, resp. only for 0.7...

How big do we think is the danger of this causing people to send funds to contracts that will be lost? Is adding the check more dangerous or not having it?

Can you sum up the actual bug again, please?

Sorry, I must have missed that comment until now; still getting used to the new github notifications.

The bug is the following:

Implicit constructors are considered non-payable, i.e. syntactically contracts with such a constructor cannot validly be created with value without low-level functions in inline assembly. However, in the presence of any base constructor (payable or non-payable), the creation code for such contracts did not contain the callvalue check, so creating such contracts with low-level functions did not revert when passing value.

In the absence of any base constructor, the callvalue check *is* generated for implicit constructors, though. Also in the presence of any explicit constructor in the most derived contract the check is generated correctly.

EDIT: I did make the changelog entry a bit more precise as well now.

So the worst thing that could happen is that someone does the following and expects it to not fail:
```
contract A { constructor() payable {} }
contract B is A {}
contract C {
  function f() public returns (A a) {
    bytes memory c = type(B).creationCode;
    uint value = msg.value;
    assembly { a := create(value, add(c, 0x20), mload(c)) }
  }
}
```
Because this used to work, but will revert after this change. However, ``new B{value: msg.value}()`` is an error for this, so it's only an issue for low-level calls.

The opposite case, i.e. why we should change this at all, is basically the same situation for the case that ``B`` really *doesn't* want to be able to receive ether in the constructor. Funds could be lost because of that, since you can still send it ether with inline assembly without the transaction reverting.

Seems like we'll be going for treating this as a proper "important bug" with "very low" severity.
Also note: it's not only inline assembly, but also creation transaction that are affected by this.

needs an entry in the bug list.
