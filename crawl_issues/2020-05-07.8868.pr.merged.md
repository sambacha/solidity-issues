This could also output the starting PCs and names of the yul functions.

Which other information would you like?

@mrchico I'm not sure I can satisfy your request to mark the modifier entry points, but here are the function entry points.

One thing to note is that if the optimizer joins two functions then one of the functions will be ignored.

Interesting!  So this is how you get around the problem of it being dependent on contract, huh?  By making it a per-contract output.

Despite my earlier comment (sorry) I'm not sure how much I'd actually use this -- after all, Truffle Debugger already does a bunch of work to determine function entry points.  Although, I guess we could use this if available?  Hm... @gnidan suggested that maybe this could also be more reliable if optimization was turned on?  Not something I've tried.  Optimization will mess with a lot of things one way or another.

The talk of modifier entry points is quite interesting, although I'm pretty confused as to how that would work given that modifiers don't have a single location at the moment.

I guess I can think of two possible uses for this, for my own purposes:

1. Decoding internal function pointers.  For that purpose it might be nice to have the entry point in constructor context as well, but I guess one can do without that, seeing as the pointer will always contain the deployed entry point.  This is the purpose for which we already determine function entry points.

2. Telling when we're entering a function -- OK, that's not something we really need new information to be able to do; we already have jump markings for that.  (Note for this purpose we *would* also need the entry points in constructor context, to tell when we're entering them while doing a deployment.)  But this *could* potentially be useful for things that *don't* get jump markings -- namely, modifiers, as mentioned above.  I've previously talked about changing modifier depth to make it more usable for this purpose, but maybe the real solution is not to use modifier depth at all, but just to have a direct record of the entry points!

...except, of course, for the problem that modifiers don't actually work here due to not having a single entry point.  Um, maybe there could be a way to list multiple entry points...?

This also could be useful for telling when we're entering things other than named functions -- i.e., constructors, fallback functions, and receive functions.  Those at least should have single entry points!  The most useful one here is constructors, for the same reason I want it for modifiers -- what I care about is not so much when we enter the main constructor, but rather when we might be entering any base constructors.  The main constructor itself, as well as fallback/receive, would just be kind of nice for printing stack traces, I guess.  I guess that's sort of a third use.  Except that, with modifiers or base constructors, using it for those purposes would also require a way to tell when we're *exiting* so things don't get unbalanced...

OK, maybe I shouldn't try to incorporate it into that, and you should ignore the things that would only be useful for that...

This looks great! Not sure what the `TODO` in the cli opts is referring to exactly, but I hope this stays available to the solc cli and not just json opts.

@haltman-at good news: Of course this is available both for the construction and the runtime context. Bad news: For both constructor and modifier the entry point is not a jumpdest and thus rather difficult to implement.

It might make sense to include local variables as outlined in this document: https://www.notion.so/Local-variables-symbols-Initial-proposal-7a317eb434204d43b7dc86e250700400

Ah, I was afraid that would probably be the case, but figured I'd ask!

If we add local variable scopes (start init, end init, end scope) to this information, it could be done by using assembly items that result in zero bytes in the output and only contain debugging information.

@chriseth Could you summarize what is left to do here? This PR has been hanging here for a long time now so I think the best course of action would be to keep the functionality to a minimum here (i.e. deal only with the function entry points) to get it merged and move the discussion to an issue where we can continue discussing other ideas (entry points for constructors and modifiers; variable scopes; adding more debug info) and implement them in subsequent PRs.

After reviewing this, I think that for function entry points we only need to make the info available via CLI and Standard JSON and add the minor tweaks from my review comments. This also needs a rebase which will unfortunately will not be a fast-forward - `InvertibleMap` has been removed and there were some changes around this code, like the naming change from #10934.

What do you think?

Updated with a slightly different approach that hopefully still works when compiling via yul.

Left to do:
 - document changes to standard json (especially the possible null values)
 - add tests
 - decide if we want to support this from cmdline or not.

I think it would be best to keep parity between Standard JSON and CLI if possible.

Thinsg like sourcemap are just in "combined json", so I will only add it to combined json.

This seems to be broken for standard-json. need to investigate.
