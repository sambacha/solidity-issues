# [\#8870 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8870) `merged`: Fix conflicting symbols in yulopti and OptimiserSuite

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-05-07 15:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8870):

If this happens again, the error message will look like this:
```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>'
what():  ERROR: Conflict between yulopti controls and Yul optimizer step abbreviations.
Character 'l' is assigned to both VarNameCleaner and CircularReferencesPruner step.
This is most likely caused by someone adding a new step abbreviation to OptimiserSuite::stepNameToAbbreviationMap() and not realizing that it's used by yulopti.
Please update the code to use a different character and recompile yulopti.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

I decided to keep it as an assertion after all to keep code simple and because it's really a bug that needs to be fixed in the code and there's nothing user can do about it.
