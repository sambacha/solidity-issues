@Marenz do you think this can not be used to generate invalid code? Maybe we should investigate that first. We of course only need to mention / summarize the cases that can lead to invalid code. If it turns out it is impossible to generate invalid code, this is not an important bug after all.

Hmm it certainly has potential for invalid code too, with some clever construction

Needs a rebase (my bug PR was quicker ;-))! I'll start reviewing anyways.

The description is incomplete and I think we should have more test cases. E.g. this one passes on develop:
```
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract C
{
        function h(bytes calldata x) external returns (bytes memory) { return x; }
        function g() public returns (bytes memory x) {
                x = this.h("\\n");
        }
}
// ----
// g() -> 0x20, 2, left(0x0a)

```

Ignore my last comments about the description, I think it's fine after all.

Sorry, correction again: the description *is* incomplete after all :-). The following doesn't contain double-backslashes, so it isn't covered by the description, but it has the same problem. It's by the way also worth a test case.
```
    pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
    
    contract C
    {
        function h(bytes calldata x) external returns (bytes memory) { return x; }
        function g() public returns (bytes memory x) {
                x = this.h("\x0101");
        }
    }
```

EDIT: actually this may be wrong again, sorry :-D...

I think `this.h("\x0101")` is encoding correctly and `\\x0101` or similar is not able to produce a `"`, so I think the next is still correct.

Actually I don't think re-scanning is possible like this - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8874#discussion_r424516164

Yes, I was too quick earlier - I just tried to come up with a way to produce anything worse, but I think it's fine. So what remains is the question whether we should still reparse after reformatting. I'd say it can't hurt, but I'd be fine without.

The problem is that CommonData.cpp is an extremely basic module and it should not import the scanner just like that...
