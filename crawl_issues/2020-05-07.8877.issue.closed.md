It may be time for the "bi-annual emscripten upgrade". Last we updated to 1.39.3 it in #7832 in November.

Since then Emscripten has made 12 releases. The [interesting changes](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) (going from oldest release):
- Added support for streaming Wasm compilation in MINIMAL_RUNTIME (off by default)
- All ports now install their headers into a shared directory under EM_CACHE.
- Add fine-grained options for specific legacy browser support, MIN_FIREFOX_VERSION, MIN_SAFARI_VERSION, MIN_IE_VERSION, MIN_EDGE_VERSION, MIN_CHROME_VERSION. The existing LEGACY_VM_SUPPORT option sets all of them to 0, that is, maximal backwards compatibility.
- SAFE_STACK has been removed, as it overlaps with STACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK. Replace SAFE_STACK=1 with STACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK=2 (note the value is 2). This also has the effect of enabling stack checking on upstream builds when ASSERTIONS are enabled (as assertions enable STACK_OVERFLOW_CHECK=2).
- Reduced default geometric memory overgrowth rate from a very generous 2x factor to a more memory conserving +20% factor, and capped maximum reservation to 96MB at most.
- Add new Fibers API for context switching, that supersedes the old coroutine API that only ran on fastcomp. See #9859
- **Added new linker option -s WASM=2 which produces a dual Wasm+JS build, which falls back to using a JavaScript version if WebAssembly is not supported in target browser/shell. (#10118)**
- Added new linker option -s CLOSURE_WARNINGS=quiet|warn|error that allows aborting the build if the Closure compiler produced any warnings.
- wasm2js optimizations. See binaryen#2623.
- **Updated of libc++abi and libc++ to llvm 9.0.0 (#10510)** (Perhaps C++20 support?)
- The default c++ version is no longer fixed at c++03. We now fall back to clang's default which is currently c++14.
- Remove hacks from memset handling, in particular, in the wasm backend, completely remove the JS version of memset from the JS library and from DEFAULT_LIBRARY_FUNCS_TO_INCLUDE. The regular C version will be linked in from compiler_rt normally.
- Minimal runtime code size optimizations, see #10725, #10724, #10663.
- **Support for WebAssembly BigInt integration with a new WASM_BIGINT flag. With that the VM will use a JS BigInt for a wasm i64, avoiding the need for JS legalization. See #10860.** (SPEEDUP)
- Add --extern-pre-js and --extern-post-js emcc flags. Files provided there are prepended/appended to the final JavaScript output, after all other work has been done, including optimization, optional MODULARIZE-ation, instrumentation like SAFE_HEAP, etc. 
- **Update libcxx and libcxxabi to LLVM 10 release branch (#11038).** (Maybe this really brings C++20 support?)

Just for the dual wasm+js option it may be worth it to consider 1.39.7. And for BigInt 1.39.13.

This maybe also reduces the size of Z3 (#8851), especially if that depends on 64-bit numbers.
