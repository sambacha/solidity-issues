# [\#8878 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8878) `merged`: Selecting Yul optimisation steps in strict assembly mode

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-05-08 20:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8878):

This is a mixed bag of small changes related to `--yul-optimizations` option:
1) Makes `--yul-optimizations` option work with `--strict-assembly`
2) Adds more info about the option to docs and READMEs
    - I was supposed to link to the table with step abbreviations from "Using the compiler" page but I don't really see a good way to include it. IR generation is an experimental feature and Yul optimiser is not even mentioned there so telling the user that he can choose optimisation steps for it seems a bit off-topic.
3) Refactors `CommandLineInterface` to consistently use constants instead of hard-coded option names
4) Modifies `cmdlineTests.sh` to allow using `input.yul` instead of `input.sol`.

3 and 4 could really be separate PRs but they're very small and the other stuff depends on them so I decided to include them all together.
