The code changes are minor adjustments due to the newer version of GCC having better support for C++20, causing some additional deprecation warnings in our C++20 build.
In particular with C++20 defaulted constructors can actually be ``private`` and capturing ``this`` with wildcard-per-value capturing ``[=]`` is deprecated (``this`` is effectively captured by reference anyways - we could have changed to ``[this,=]`` I think, but ``[&]`` should also be fine everywhere).
