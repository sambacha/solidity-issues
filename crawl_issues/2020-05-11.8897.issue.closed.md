## Description
There is no linux binary provided for the [`v0.4.26` Solidity release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.26).

Building from source can be challenging and time consuming, it would be helpful to Linux users to have a `solc_static_linux` file available for download.
