# [\#8899 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8899) `closed`: Reasoning based simplifier.

This is an experimental optimizer module that uses SMT to check conditions.

It currently only considers SSA variables and does not track terminating branches etc.

This could be combined with the conditional simplifier that adds `_condition := 0` after if statements with terminating bodies. In that case, it would have to be extended to non-ssa variables as well.

Initially, I was a bit concerned that we have to take a whole lot of care to encode things correctly and not to miss anything... but looking at this: just evaluating to new uninterpreted constants whenever something is "unimplemented" seems pretty safe...
And it's extensible - we could even model memory and storage as "arrays" without too much danger of introducing unsound behaviour...
So if this actually scales, so far it seems to me that this is really mainly a matter of reproducibility and validating proof certificates...

Emscripten builds for this depend on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8851.

Apart from a mechanism to verify the proofs and make it deterministic, we have to decide whether we want this module to perform the checks on termination itself and whether we maybe want to inline certain functions just for the purpose of the reasoning engine (like we do in the BMC encoding).

First goal: Make this remove the third check in 
```
            function fun_f_32(vloc_x, vloc_y) -> vloc
            {
                if iszero(lt(vloc_x, shl(100, 1))) { revert(vloc, vloc) }
                if iszero(lt(vloc_y, shl(100, 1))) { revert(vloc, vloc) }
                if and(iszero(iszero(vloc_x)), gt(vloc_y, div(not(0), vloc_x))) { revert(vloc, vloc) }
                vloc := mul(vloc_x, vloc_y)
            }
```

To do for that:
 - [x] add `shl`
 - [x] add `not`

I added shl and not (had to make some modifications to the sort system), but z3 did not reduce the test. It also took rather long :(

@chriseth I thought you were going to use BV directly here.
Some things that might be slowing it down are, the `int2bv` and `bv2int` conversions at every arithmetic operation, and the `%` applied after.
BV uses modular arithmetic, so if you use BV directly you get that for free.
And if you implement `bvadd` (etc) you don't need the conversions.
Then my concern would be the size of the BVs (256), but that we'll need to see later.

Currently, this is failing because `<` translates to signed-less-than for bit vectors.

z3 has an bv ult function, it just needs to be added to the interface.

@ekpyron what is a proof certificate? The encoded SMT query (and its answer)?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2020-06-04 23:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8899#issuecomment-639179041):

@axic Do you want the long answer :-)?
There are two issues with just calling z3 like this without further care:
- z3 has bugs. Not merely theoretically, but it does happen in practice that it invalidly reports unsat. It's unclear if that is *likely* to happen with the kind of queries we will feed it here, but it is a danger - and an unsound response from z3 means invalid bytecode here.
- z3 is non-deterministic. One can try to make it *decently* deterministic, but it'll never be entirely deterministic - e.g. @leonardoalt and I are regularly fighting with z3 reporting inconsistent results between local builds and CI - we can never fully expect emscripten builds, windows builds and linux builds to be able to solve exactly the same queries in the same way. In the worst case two queries about the same problem on the very same machine can produce different results (again that doesn't happen *often*, but it *does* happen).

The easiest solution for solving the non-determinism alone is to just store the SMT queries and the answer Z3 gave at compilation time in the metadata and require to feed it back for deterministic recompilation (replacing the calls to z3 here with a lookup in this list).

However, this opens an attack window - people can try to add fake query answers to the metadata. If we just believe those, people can clandestinely have us generate invalid bytecode. We can of course *re-run* z3 on the query and hope for getting the same result - and error out if z3 says something different either because of its non-determinism or because it's actually a malicious fake-answer. But even then people could actively exploit known bugs in z3 and try to construct queries yielding invalid results based on them. That would probably be a hard thing to do (especially without requiring to do very specific weird things in the code itself to achieve such specific queries, which would be noticable), but could theoretically be possible.

There is one theoretic way out of this mess. Z3 can produce "proof terms"/"proof certificates"/"refutation certificates". That's a set of statements in some fomat (unfortunately non-standardized - the SMT community apparently tries to standardize that, but hasn't managed yet) that provides a line of reasoning following some simple verifiable rules that proves that the answer to the query is correct.
Unfortunately the generation of these proof terms is in a rather sorry state - apparently they are not always complete (i.e. there are non-trivial reasoning holes in them that have to be filled by more complex reasoning mechanisms) and don't seem to receive prime support from z3. See e.g. https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/4226 or I can cite from a recent thread on the Isabelle mailing list: "we are the only consumers of those proof objects, and the Z3 designers always felt those proof objects are a pain" (that's from a discussion about proofs directly reconstructed from Z3's proof certificate output being banned as proving method in the "Archive of Formal Proofs" since they are too volatile). Indeed, http://www21.in.tum.de/~boehmes/proofrec.pdf seems to be the only place I know of where this is actually done (and that actually works, I've used that often as part of working with Isabelle) - but they have an entire theorem proving environment at their disposal to do it...

Right now I'm not entirely clear on what we should do here. Building a verifyer for z3's proof certificates ourselves is theoretically feasible (and could be done incrementally - we could just ignore all results from Z3 for which we can't verify the proof) - but it's quite a hard thing to do and a huge effort - and it would have to be done with extreme care, since we'd need to rely on it being sound. So I'm not sure it's feasible in practice. On the other hand we could decide that the risk of *not* verifying proof certificates is manageable and only rerunning the queries is enough. E.g. one could still have another external solver like cvc4 independently verify the queries to reduce the risk or we could just trust in Z3 not having bugs that could be exploited this way given the theories we use and the queries we feed it - resp. we can decide that such attacks are unlikely, because they would be too hard to be successfully accomplished... but I'm not sure :-).

That's what I meant :-).

Similar approach in Coq using different solvers https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05947.pdf - and contains some links to several proposed standards for formats for certificates.
Another interesting approach: http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~ajreynol/pxtp12.pdf

And another thought: an advantage in actively verifying some kind of proof certificate is that it would theoretically even make it possible to have safe "custom" optimizations - i.e. people could call z3 externally in a tuned way with huge timeouts for their specific contract or even for a specific query or use different solvers or build entire formal analysis tools that solve such queries automatically - and just feed us back proofs we can verify. Really a shame that there is no universal standardized format for something like this yet... in a perfect world, there would be such a format and it would come with a portable standard implementation of a verifyer we could just plug in :-).

Speed increased by several orders of magnitude after switching to "int" - the tests are running instantly now. This needs some "shortcuts" for the bitwise operators: There is an ite-based specialization for the case that the arguments are 0/1 and it uses bitvectors otherwise. So if the solver can reason that and/or are only used on functions that return boolean values, it will be fast, otherwise it will be slow.

So it's fast now with SMT Int + `ite`s for bitwise operations?

Yes, but I assume it will be slow if real bit operations are used. We should probably reduce the resource limit.

Ideas for other simplifications:
 - for `and(x, y)` check if `and(x, y) == x` and replace it by `x` if that is the case
 - for any variable `x` check if we can prove `x == c` for a new variable c. If that is the case, determine that value by asking for a model that disproves `x != c` (and maybe check again) and then replace `x` by the value for `c`

@ekpyron and I had a discussion about the second point of the comment above, so just writing here what is maybe a more precise description of that:
Given an expression `expr`, is `expr` constant? That is, does it have one and only one model? Where `expr` can be a variable, arithmetic expression, etc.
- We first query the solver with the current constraints. Most likely it says SAT (otherwise the current point is unreachable). We ask for a `model` for `expr`.
- We push the constraint `expr != model` and query the solver again. If it says UNSAT, `expr` is constant and can be replaced by `model` in the code. If it says SAT, `expr` has more models and cannot be replaced precisely by one constant.

Assuming the analyzed code is reachable, this process always takes exactly two SMT queries.
