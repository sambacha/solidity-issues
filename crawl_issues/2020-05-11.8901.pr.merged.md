I worked on top of develop, than did rebase to breaking. Will need to fix build, till then it will be draft.

This needs an entry in the changelog and maybe an update in the documentation.

I did add Changelog entry and documentation into breaking changes for 0.7.0
Couldn't find more places where shifts are documented, so should be enough I guess.

Please add some documentation to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#integers and https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#fixed-size-byte-arrays
