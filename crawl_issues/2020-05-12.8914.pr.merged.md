# [\#8914 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8914) `merged`: Down with unique_ptr!

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1988485?v=4" width="50">[randomnetcat](https://github.com/randomnetcat) opened issue at [2020-05-12 15:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8914):

There are places where it appears that `unique_ptr` is used as a poor man's optional. This is a bad thing because it forces unnecessary heap allocations and obscures intent.

This PR replaces `unique_ptr` data members with `optional` whenever it appears there are no lifetime concerns.

What are our guidelines for using unique_ptr? The use-cases here are almost all patterns of "lazy-initialized values" - shouldn't we rather have a template for that?

`unique_ptr` is still needed for dynamically polymorphic base classes and certain weird lifetime scenarios (like the one in boostTest.cpp).

There probably should be a template for lazy-init. That has some overlap with `SetOnce` from #8640, which had approximately the same use-case, although this PR's use case has slightly different constraints (it should be copyable, etc).

I just noticed that `solidity/libyul/AsmData.h` has such instances. For example:
```cpp
struct Case { langutil::SourceLocation location; std::unique_ptr<Literal> value; Block body; };
```

I fear this is getting too big. Can you split out the lazy part into its own PR?

Sure. Should I split out just the definition of `LazyInit` or its usages, too?

I would prefer to split out both.

LazyInit has been fully split out into #8931.

Needs a rebase. `solc-js` tests should work then
