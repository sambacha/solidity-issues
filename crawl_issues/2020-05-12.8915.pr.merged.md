# [\#8915 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8915) `merged`: Remove a dedicated error flag from DeclarationTypeChecker and other classes

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-05-12 16:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8915):

There are five classes (`DeclarationTypeChecker`, `DocStringAnalyser`, `ReferencesResolver`, `DocStringParser`, `AsmAnalyzer`) which use a similar pattern. Namely, a few error reporter functions are wrapped in order to set an **error-occured-flag**.

It creates an extra indirection error and some amount of boiler-plate code, which would be good to avoid.

(This PR a part of the unique-error-ID saga.)

Changes of `DeclarationTypeChecker` (02d1f8c) illustrate the idea. BTW, it seems to be the only case where the tests have to be adjusted.

Can you explain why the function did not return false before?

The difference is that now any error (direct or indirect) would result in returning `false`. Previously, only errors reported from `DeclarationTypeChecker` via the wrappers would cause `false`.
