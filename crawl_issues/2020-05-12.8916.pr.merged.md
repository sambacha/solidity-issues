# [\#8916 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8916) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Support array push/pop

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-05-12 16:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8916):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6048
Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8848

- [x] Needs more tests
- [x] push: add implicit require that `array.length < 2^256 - 1` before the push (as a real world assumption)
- [x] document the assumption above
- [x] pop: add underflow verification target on `length - 1` and do not wrap

Well, I think your examples should work just as you described. In practice this would all run out of gas I suppose, but the semantics of the language are exactly as you described, so I think the SMTChecker should do the same (currently implementation).

@ekpyron 
> in practice this assertion should always hold (in CHC), but in your encoding it will break, because you can call f 2^256 times and have x[0] == 23, right?

I think this assertion should break, for the reasons you described

Ok... I'm just wondering if we didn't get more natural results, if we considered an imaginary ``require(x.length < 2^256-1)`` before any ``x.push``... but this is a slippery slope...

We could also do that, but then we'll report some false negatives for cases where the overflow actually happens...
Do we have any limit like that in the code generator?
