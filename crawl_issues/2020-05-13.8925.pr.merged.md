Isn't the first commit already merged?

@axic Wow, things are moving quick today :-). Yes, it was merged, but I need to rebase this for github to notice - just did that now :-).

What happens before and after this change with:
```
contract c {
  bytes b;
  function f() public {
    b = msg.data[:10];
  }
}
```

Does it go through a copy to memory?

@chriseth Added it as test case - still not allowed without explicit casts.
I can look into allowing everything like this without explicit casts as well here, though - for dynamic calldata types with static base type it should be safe...

Ah ok then it is good! I was just concerned that it did a needless calldata-to-memory copy.
