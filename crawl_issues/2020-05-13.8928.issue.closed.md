# [\#8928 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8928) `closed`: Extract libsmtutil out of libsolidity/formal

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-05-13 12:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8928):

We should extract the contents of `libsolidity/formal` into a `libsmtutil` that can also be used by `libyul`. This should contain things that do not depend on anything Solidity related.
Potential cases for that:
- Sorts
- SolverInterface
- *Interface
- SMTPortfolio
