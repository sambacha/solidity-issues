# [\#8944 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8944) `merged`: Disable Z3 in fuzzer builds

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-05-14 15:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8944):

Disables Z3 for fuzzer builds in favour of speed (because z3 queries can take a longish time to finish)

Another reason to disable Z3 is we should no longer care about Z3 issues e.g., memory corruption. This should be done by the Z3 team if they think it is necessary.
