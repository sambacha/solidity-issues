tl;dr
Support reentrancy from unknown code without losing all knowledge.

This PR extends the CHC model to support external calls to unknown code. Since the code is unknown, it is sound to assume that it can nondeterministically call the analyzed contract, any number of times.
Because of that, the model is extended with 2 new types of rules that encode this nondeterminism, using a new predicate `nondet_interface(state, state')` for each analyzed contract, that allow the state to change nondeterministically from `state` to `state'`.

The first rule is a fact added for each contract:
1. `nondet_interface(state, state)`
This fact is the base case of the inductive rule, and allows the nondeterministic step to be applied without state changes.

The second rule is the inductive rule over each public function `f` of the contract:
2. `nondet_interface(state, state') && summary_f(state', state'') => nondet_interface(state, state'')`

When an external call to unknown code is seen, CHC simply adds the constraint
`nondet_interface(currentState, postState)` to the current block/rule. This means that the current contract can be called nondeterministically any number of times (including zero) before moving on to the next block.
Note that because it is nondeterministic, if a certain path allows for state changes in the contract, it will necessarily be reached and taken into account, so this model is sound.

If the contract has public functions that allow arbitrary state changes, knowledge will be lost at this point, but there's not much else one can do.
However, if the contract has a certain behavior where the current state might limit state changes in reentrant calls, this will be taken into account when generating invariants.
See the `mutex.sol` example added in this PR.

Right, that makes sense! (re `staticcall`).

Yea, I also have a few test cases in mind that I still want to add.

Rebased on top of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9176 to see if the nondet problem is gone

Apparently the nondeterminism in the tests in my local arch build vs CI was that the arch z3 uses gmp whereas the others don't.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9159 helps with the nondeterminism

This needs a rebase to resolve the conflicts
