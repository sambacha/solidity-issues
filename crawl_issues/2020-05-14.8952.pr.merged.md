# [\#8952 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8952) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Simplify end visit for internal calls (refactor)

~Based on #8951 which needs to be merged first. Could also be rebased on #8949 which is immediately below but this requires resolving a minor conflict so I left them one on the other.~ It's based on `develop` now.

Refactoring changes extracted from #8943 (and before that from #8797). Does not affect functionality.
Related to #6788 and #8485.

I have changed the base branch to `develop` so this can now be reviewed independently. I just realized that #8797 does not really require this refactor.

Well, CI just proved me wrong :) While removing this PR from under #8797 did not cause conflicts, the functions from here are still used there. I'll just keep a copy of the commit in both branches. I think this will get merged quickly and the commit will simply disappear from #8797 after rebase.
