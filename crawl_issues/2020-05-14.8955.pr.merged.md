I looked for `_` in the name so I might have missed some that don't have it. I think I got most of them though.

It came up during the work on #8797 though it's not strictly related.

`IRNames` grew quite a bit. Maybe I should move it to a module of its own?

Changes done. I have also changed base branch to `develop` so that it can be merged without waiting for all the other refactoring PRs.
