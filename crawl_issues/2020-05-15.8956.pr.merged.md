@cameel 

Thank you! Done, see 67d5b4f. I did not squash (yet) to simplify the review.

@chriseth 
I think that necessity to call instances of the class `ErrorWatcher` in another way (e.g. `noNewError` or `ok`) would indicate bad naming in the first place. So the current proposal is to be explicit. I opted for `ok()` instead of `success()` to have it shorter.
