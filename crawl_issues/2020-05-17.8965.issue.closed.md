Opening this issue to track `keccak256` implementation for ewasm. It was mentioned as being done in this PR's description: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8049, but it is not: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c1ed5bbb0ff078ff5cfe7287a603b1385e6d6ee9/libyul/backends/wasm/EVMToEwasmTranslator.cpp#L808-L811

@axic is there some implementation we can use?

I think this could be "esaily" translated to yul: https://github.com/axic/keccak-wasm

Or just include it in text form.

We have to implement it in a way such that it does not need additional memory...

Will be hard. In the "Ewasm 1.0" design it is suggested a keccak256 precompile would exists, I guess we could do that with EVMHost...

@aarlt This looks like the task you're working on right now so I'm adding you as "assigned" and moving to "in progress".

We're closing all wasm issues for now.
