# [\#8986 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8986) `closed`: Enable Yul to Wasm compilation in standard compiler

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-05-19 20:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8986):

The `compileYul` function should output wasm if a wasm artifact is requested like for solidity. The way to compile yul to wasm is mainly via `AssemblyStack::translate`.

You are right! Can you change the documentation accordingly (it still says "not yet supported")?
