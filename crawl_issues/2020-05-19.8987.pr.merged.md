# [\#8987 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8987) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Bound functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-05-19 20:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8987):

This is the last feature missing from #8485.

The implementation turned out to be surprisingly short and simple given how many different cases this generates for the user. Most of the effort went into making sure that it works with all possible types and trying to find weird corner cases.

The PR does **not** contain:
- Syntax tests covering all the invalid usage examples I tried (requested by @axic). I'll clean them up and submit them in a separate PR.
- Tests for `struct`s. The code should work for them as well but I couldn't find a way to write a working test since most of their features are not yet implemented in the IR generator.
