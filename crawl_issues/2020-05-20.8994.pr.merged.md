# [\#8994 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8994) `merged`: Fix type inversion for shift and exp operators.

fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8895

Integer literals used `binaryOperatorResult()` on the type of the right operand to determine the resulting type, i.e. they swapped the types. This of course does not work properly when the operation is not symmetric with regards to the types.

> I am fine with changes. There is one small thing about double warning, but if we are fine with this, I would not object.

Also, tests need to be fixed

The failing test shows that this changes semantics without an error. Maybe we should reconsider.

As a summary:

For a `uint i`, `2**i` used to be computed in the `uint` type. If we use `x**i` for a `uint8 x`, then it is computed in the `uint8` type. The code shows that this is a bug and it should be consistently computed in the `uint8` type.

Should we target 0.7.0 for this and keep it a warning only?

I think it should target 0.7.0, and add a warning until then.

Decision: warn now and fix with 0.7

Decision: just use uint for literals and target 0.7.

Still need to work on documentation and (un-)change the tests.

squashed.
