The artifact generated in the `b_osx` task in CircleCI should be ready for release

Note that if you download the artifact with a web browser, it will put it into quarantine, which means that it won't be executable (even after running `chmod +x <artifact>`). It can be taken out of quarantine with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <artifact>`.

Putting a file into quarantine is the responsibility of the program downloading it, so apps like Truffle, Buidler, etc, can just skip this process and execute them directly.

What is the requirement for CircleCI to run? So as to be able to see the result of the change and validate is release ready

*sigh* - circleci got weird in the last days. I hope it does still run on external pull requests in general...

I'll merge this PR and the we can see.
