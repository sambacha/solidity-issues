# [\#9001 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9001) `merged`: Refactor TypeChecker to assign different IDs to different errors

There are still cases where different errors in `TypeChecker` are reported with the same ID. This PR addresses them.

Note that this is not a black-and-white picture. Sometimes it is not really clear if we have two different errors or just two flavors of of the same error.
