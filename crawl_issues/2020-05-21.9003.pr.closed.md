Will this "just work" once it is merged?

It should "just work". But let me check once more on my repo so I can be 100% sure.

Changed to different github action, as the one I used for first needed more permissions than `GITHUB_TOKEN` is giving.
You can find here more about `GITHUB_TOKEN` https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/authenticating-with-the-github_token

Updated PR and it will sort issues to `Solidity` project automatically once merged (and default column is `New issues`).

Looking at skeet70/default-project-board-action I find it weird that it has to perform additional requests to retrieve the issue and project id. I'm wondering if we were better of just writing those scripts ourselves...

I think yes, as it is really simple thing. That will allow us to do more custom things later.
But than, where it should be done. I think solidity repo is not the place where we want this code :)

I'm mainly worried that we are exposing the github token to all the npm dependencies this pulls in.

Was there a decision whether to use this or write our own?

I would feel more comfortable with writing our own - I don't think it is more complicated than the scripts we already have, and it can be tweaked more easily.

Let's close this one than and start writing our own.
