# [\#9007 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9007) `merged`: Report an error if immutables not assigned

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-05-23 19:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9007):

Here is a possible fix for #8727.

The problem is that the optimizer removes unreachable code, which has immutable assignments. Should we just forbid it? I'm not completely sure.

Alternatively we could show a warning and/or conditionally suppress the assert.

In 970250b uses `ErrorReporter` with a new error type (`Error::Type::CodeGenerationError`).

**Pros:**
- we can return multiple errors,
- we do not introduce any new reporting mechanisms.

**Cons:**
- it is somewhat painful to drag reference to ErrorReporter down to `Assembly` (could make it a member of `Compiler` or `CompilerContext`, but not sure if it is a good thing);
- ugly assert-or-report in *libevmasm/Assembly.cpp*.

Catching `FatalError` in `CompilerStack::compileContract` can be moved to `Compiler::compileContract` (but `CompilerStack` already has a couple of other `FatalError` catches).

Looks good in general!

The assignment is not unreachable, only the end of the constructor is unreachable. Are you saying the constructor is removed by the optimiser?

I would need to double check, but as far as I remember, the assignments of immutables are placed right after the constructor (as if they would be at the end of the constructor), and the optimizer removes what goes after `while(true) ;`.

The a07e2a7a2b399f80208f93630bdb0e8ed39c1bf3 can be considered separately (although it was done while I was looking at different ways to fix the issue).

I would prefer not exposing the ErrorReporter to code generation routines. Can you throw an exception instead that contains an explanation string which is then turned into an error?

Exposing `ErrorReporting` is also one of my concerns. We can just throw, it would significantly simplify the implementation. However, with such approach we will not be able to report multiple errors, or even warnings.

Are we fine with that?

Yes, that's fine. An error after the analysis phase should be very rare anyay.

81e60a4e is a possible implementation with exceptions. Code is much shorter.

But I'm not happy with the diagnostics. Technically we are correct - immutables are not assigned. But the root cause of the problem is the endless loop, making us stuck in the constructor.

Sorry - this needs another rebase.

Tests need to be updated to 0.7.0 syntax
