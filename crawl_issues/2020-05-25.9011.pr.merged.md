@axic The natspec currently looks like this:

```JSON

======= /tmp/natspec.sol:ERC20 =======
Developer Documentation
{
  "events":
  {
    "Transfer(address,address,uint256)":
    {
      "details": "A test case!",
      "params":
      {
        "amount": "The amount.",
        "from": "The source account.",
        "to": "The destination account."
      }
    }
  },
  "methods": {}
}
User Documentation
{
  "events":
  {
    "Transfer(address,address,uint256)":
    {
      "notice": "This event is emitted when a transfer occurs."
    }
  },
  "methods": {}
}
```

Do you have any preferences?

We need the information about whether a parameter is indexed or not in order to properly work with events. This is not included in the computation of the signature though. Do you think we can still include this somehow?
