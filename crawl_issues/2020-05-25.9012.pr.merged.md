This case is still faulty, looking into it:
```
2 | /*  2017 */ constructor () public { "©©©©©©©©©"; }
  |                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

Pushed a probably simpler solution. But the fuzzer can't handle my 4byte unicode test character and fails

The functionality in this PR makes the current situation better, but it is not a complete solution to the problem, we completely ignore grapheme clusters and in some fonts some unicode characters are wider than others which breaks our length calculation again (example: 65335: Ｗ). 
However, I don't think it is worth having a complete solution as that would be way too much work. I'd consider this PR as "good enough"
