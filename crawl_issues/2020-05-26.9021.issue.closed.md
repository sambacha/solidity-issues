Nice, this triggers exactly the `solAssert(false)` I wasn't sure how to trigger, was looking for such cases

Reopening because the following new fuzzer test case throws the same ICE

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
        int[][] array2d;
        function l() public {
                array2d.push().push();
        }
}
```
