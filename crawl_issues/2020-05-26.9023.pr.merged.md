# [\#9023 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9023) `merged`: Fixed seed for randomness, fixed conflicts in errorids

I think the seed for the random number generator was not set correctly. Consider the following situation: Two users creates a branch from develop. Adds a `0000_error` for new errors. If they run `correct_error_ids.py`, they would both get the same error-id as same replacements. Because their seeds were the same. (The new seed is set once, and is a call to system time.)

Also ran `correct_error_ids.py` to fix existing conflicts.

It was intentional. It is often helpful to have reproducible random numbers.

However I wanted to change it for the production system, just the way you did. Thanks a lot!

Are the changed numbers all duplicates?

@chriseth I think so. I did verify a few of them.

With the current deterministic script, the same random ids would be generated in two branches. After @hrkrshnn 's fix only incidental collisions are expected.
