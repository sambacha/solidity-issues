# [\#9028 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9028) `closed`: Cannot access overridden virtual function by name due to failed overload resolution
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description
If you try to refer to an overridden virtual function by its name without specifying arguments (e.g. by assigning it to a pointer, `ptr = f;`), the compilation fails; `Error: No matching declaration found after variable lookup.`.

## Environment
- Compiler version: 0.6.9 (`develop`)

## Steps to Reproduce
This compiles (a direct all to overridden `f`):
``` solidity
contract A {
    function f() virtual internal {}
}
contract B is A {
    function f() override internal {}
    function h() internal { f(); }
}
```

This compiles too (just accessing `f` which is not overridden):
``` solidity
contract A {
    function f() virtual internal {}
}
contract B is A {
    function h() internal { f; }
}
```

But this does not  (just accessing overridden `f`):
``` solidity
contract A {
    function f() virtual internal {}
}
contract B is A {
    function f() override internal {}
    function h() internal { f; }
}
```

The error is:
```
Error: No matching declaration found after variable lookup.
 --> virtual_test.sol:6:25:
  |
6 |   function h() internal { f; }
  |                           ^
```

This is due to failed overload resolution. There are two definitions of `f` and the compiler does not know which one to choose. This is the expected behavior with overloaded functions.

But it's not an overload. It's a virtual function being overridden and the compiler should only consider `B.f` since `f` can never refer to `A.f` in this context.

The error should happen only if the virtual function is also being overloaded at the same time:
``` solidity
contract A {
    function f(uint, uint) virtual internal {}
    function f(uint) virtual internal {}
}
contract B is A {
    function h() internal { f; }
}
```
