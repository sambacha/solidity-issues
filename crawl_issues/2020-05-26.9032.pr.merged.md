# [\#9032 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9032) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Remove wrong assumption about function declarations associated an expressions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-05-26 22:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9032):

Part of the work on #6788 and #8485.

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8721#discussion_r413883747 I was asked to assert that in case of a function call, if it's a direct call, the associated function declaration matches `FunctionType.declaration`. While doing this I also incorrectly assumed the opposite - that if the call is being done via a function variable or expression, the declaration is missing.

Turns out the assumption was wrong. `FunctionType` of an expression will be associated with a declaration if and only if the expression directly refers the function by name.

A small inconsistency that threw me off the right track at first was that this example seemed to contradict this:

``` solidity
contract C {
    function f() internal {}
    function g() internal { (f)(); }
}
```

I thought that in the above the type of `(f)` was not associated with a definition because the assertion did not fail. Turns out that `g` simply does not go through code generation because it's not called by anything external.
