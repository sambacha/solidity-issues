Related to #8913 and #9039 so that the fuzzer does not generate it.

Is it bad if we get a warning? I think we should fuzz it as long as it is still usable.

So only remove it when it's really removed? Makes sense

No. I just thought if we are going to deprecate it, why spend cycles testing.

May be I should rebase this PR on `breaking`  instead of `develop`?

Yep, rebasing onto breaking is a good idea!

This PR has now been rebased on `breaking` and the base branch of merge has been update likewise.
