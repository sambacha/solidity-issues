I fixed this simply by changing the order of if-checks in the overload resolution.
It was checking for `annotation.arguments` supposedly to find out if it refers to a function or not. The problem was that this is only filled in the visit for `FunctionCall`.
When the check fails, it assumes a variable, even when there is only one candidate.

I found no downsides to this change yet. One thing that worries me is that we get the correct (in terms of inheritance) candidate when `cleanOverloadedDeclarations()` is run.
But I couldn't find a scenario where this actual was a problem. If you can think of one, please share.
