Closes #8900

Depends on #9235.

It is targeting PR which needs to be merged before this one to develop.

Looks like most of the changes I commented on were actually a part of #8967. Sorry for the mess. I'll try to move the ones that are still relevant and mark them as resolved here.

I tried to remove that first commit. I expected it to be excluded when I did rebase, but didn't happen
So, now here is only commit that is related to enabling `.runtimeCode`

Yeah, my bad. I should have noticed that `yulSubObjectAccessWithDot` is the base branch. I actually even checked it out locally to play with the code but it did not click until I submitted my review :)

As for this PR, I don't see any more problems here but I think it has to wait for #8967.

Why was it needed to create a new PR?

I couldn’t rebase the old one at all. There were two commits that I couldn’t remove. Maybe it was related to github latency...

Also it was including some comments which are not related to this PR at all.

Ah okay, could also just push over, but too many comments can be confusing of course. I thought it was just related to github issues of today :)
