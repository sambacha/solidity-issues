by allowing the arithmetic operations to be computed on FixedPoint variables as well.

We can't add a test for this one because it will fail code generation.

That's a lie, isn't it :-)? The same is true for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9067/files, isn't it? Those throw in codegen as well and it's still fine to add them - apparently the smt tests don't call codegen...

Yes, that's true!
Only figured out later that if the function is internal it's fine, because of no codegen

As in: if it's an internal function that is never used
