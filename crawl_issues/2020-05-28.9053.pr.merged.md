Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8807

Open questions:
 - [x] source ID scheme
 - [x] output optimized yul code if optimizer enabled?
 - [ ] CLI support?
 - [x] combined-json support?

@haltman-at I added the yul ast - please check again (also others, too): https://417293-40892817-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/soljson.js

We might want to output the optimized yul code if the optimizer is activated.

This would be super nice to have as a `solc --combined-json` option as well üôè

OK, I finally had a chance to try this out and it seems to be mostly working but I'm getting some sort of ID collision in certain examples.  Will let you know more details when I have them.

Oh, nevermind, it's not a real collision.  It's just two different contracts using `utility.yul`.

Hm, I seem to be occasionally hitting some problem that's resulting in some sort of hang.  No idea what's going on there at the moment, will look into it...

Nevermind, found the problem, it was just a bug in my code.  Still want to play around with this a little bit more but this seems pretty good to me so far!

@MrChico to be honest, adding this to the commandline will be a little tricky.

OK, having tried this out some more, I'd say this is pretty good!  I've written up a PR to allow Truffle Debugger to make use of it, for whenever it gets released.

Hm, is there any way that generated sources could not all get the same name?  I don't know, this might not be that important, I think we can handle it if they don't but it would be more convenient if they had different names.

@haltman-at I'm not sure about the name - what would you base the name on? In which context should it be unique?

Documentation and changelog still missing.

How so?

Tested the optimized output with remix and it works.

Added export via combined-json. Direct commandline export is difficult because this would generated four files per contract.

Well, it would be ideal if sources with different IDs also got assigned different names.  But I'm not sure it's a big deal.  I already changed my Truffle PR for processing this stuff to handle them having the same name, after all...
