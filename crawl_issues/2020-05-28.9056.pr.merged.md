This should implement everything needed for all combinations of getters.

It does not have tests mostly because other features need to be implemented first to be able to test structs and mappings (see the next PR in the row, for example).

Let it be noted that I said that we should still have more tests for this, even beyond #9058 :-). Mappings to arrays of structs - arrays of mappings to structs, etc. - at least one for each combination would be nice.
