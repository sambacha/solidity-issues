- work in progress
- still incomplete, hacky & unoptimized, but probably the basic idea is already visible
- introduction of `EVMHosts`, that inherits from `EVMHost`.. `EVMHosts` is now used within `ExecutionFramework`, the different evm vms will be initialized via the command line option`--evmc`
- current idea is basically to distinguish between creation & normal calls to the evmc vms
- based on the capability of the evm, "evm" or "ewasm" bytecode is deployed to the evmc vm
- normal calls e.g. `sendMessage(..)` will basically iterate through the defined evms and call "`sendMessage`" per instance.. results will be collected and compared if they are the same
- if they are the same some members of `EVMHosts` will be set, so that e.g. `SolidityEndToEndTests.cpp` can still operate on the defined member variables, if they where not the same, an assertion will fail
- created a `fake-ewasm` branch of evmone here https://github.com/aarlt/evmone/tree/fake-ewasm, this special evmone will basically just set the `ewasm` capability flag
- right now no contract is compiled to ewasm, instead the bytecode for ewasm is just `evm` bytecode, appended with some additional bytes `fake-ewasm`.. I did this to be able to test the "deployment-behaviour" before hera supports evmc v7

I don't think we should implement this kind of "Y"-connector. We should handle wasm in a similar way as we handle compileViaYul. The host just receives a VM and does its thing - it should not care about what that VM really is.

Replaced by #9143.
