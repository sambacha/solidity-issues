I added a commit that activates additional tests.

Even after adding more tests `semanticTests/various/negative_stack_height.sol` fails with `StackTooDeepError`.

Can you check if we get `StackTooDeep` only because the optimizer is not activated?

It is trying to compile it with viaYul, and it comes from `optimize()` call in `AssemblyStack`. Still, that error should be caught in SemanticTest and it should be fine as test is marked with compileViaYul: false ...

There are more tests to be active. I remember I added commit with those, but in rebase/force push it was lost probably :)
