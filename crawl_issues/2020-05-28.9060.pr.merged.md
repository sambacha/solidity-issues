# [\#9060 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9060) `merged`: Constants for flags in wasm::BinaryTransform (refactor)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-05-28 19:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9060):

Small refactor extracted from #8240.

I think it's better to have constants here instead of using comments to explain the 1s and 0s. It took me a moment to realize what the comment was even referring to.
