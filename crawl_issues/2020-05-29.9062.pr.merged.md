# [\#9062 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9062) `merged`: Fix internal compiler error related to oversized objects

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-05-29 02:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9062):

As it is difficult to make an instance of an `ErrorReporter` available, we can throw instead.
Then we catch the error in a class which has `ErrorReporter` and report it normally.

If we do it here, we may also do it in PR #9007, instead of dragging `ErrorReporter` across classes.

Interesting, new test files cause internal compiler error in fuzzer. Could we detect wrong layouts during `CompilerStack::analyze()`?

@ekpyron can you take a look here, please? Shouldn't we have checks "on the outside" for these situations?

I think the proper way to handle this is to add a storage check to ``ArrayType::validForLocation``.
When I refactored that I was actually surprised that there wasn't a storage case involved. I'm pretty sure adding a ``DataLocation::Storage`` case there that basically does the exact same thing as the ``DataLocation::Memory`` case should catch this error early enough.

If that's true, the checks in ``StorageOffsets::computeOffsets`` can remain proper assertions. (I just checked: they actually threw exceptions in 0.6.8, but were turned into assertions with the introduction of error IDs - and if we change ``validForLocation`` accordingly assertions should be fine and the best way to do this)

Right :). And after turning them into assertions I wanted to investigate if the failure might happen under normal circumstances, so came up with the crashing tests.

There are two problems: oversized arrays and oversized classes (where we sum up all relevant data sizes). How do I check the second?

Adding the check in ``ArrayType::validForLocation`` will solve the oversized array issue.
But you're right, that the "oversized object" issue might remain, but then we should find a suitable place to add a dedicated "up-front"-check for this as well. I think having a stage in ``ContractLevelChecker`` that sums up the static sizes of the state variables and assures that the sum is small enough should be early enough and should work.

Always better to avoid expectedly throwing and catching exceptions :-).

Just popped in to say this may close #9099 . Is that right @a3d4 ?

Yep, I think so :).

I came here trying to determine if we need assertions or exceptions. I was not aware about the existing issues when I started the PR, so I had to create my own crashing tests :).

You can complete "oversized arrays part", and I can do "oversized objects" then. Deal :)?

We should fine-tune array oversized handling (could be PR #9129).

What is the state of this now?
