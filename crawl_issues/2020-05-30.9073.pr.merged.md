# [\#9073 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9073) `merged`: Add error IDs to JSON and console output

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-05-30 00:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9073):

Now `--standard-json` output includes error IDs, as well as default console output.

Please add a changelog entry.

Especially this close to a release, we should only merge this in combination with the error id for the commandline error reporter.

Are we sure that we want to show the IDs in the console output by default? What value does it bring to the user?

BTW, clang and gcc do not show such error IDs. Visual C++ does.

I think I would find it weird to get an error id with the message while compiling things myself. Automated compilation will most likely using the standard json mode, so why not output the error ids only in that case?

I'd not output them by default in the CLI, but add a command line flag that enables them.

OK, I added a new command line option, ` --error-codes`.

I realized that what we call "error ID" became, after all the refactoring, pretty much a regular "compilation error code". I believe it is less confusing and use the term in command line and JSON.

Maybe I should rename `ErrorId` to `ErrorCode` internally too.

Can you create a pull request to `breaking` to auto-enable the output of error codes?

Also please add a commandline test that outputs error codes.

Do we want that? Apparently @leonardoalt and I (and gcc and clang) are rather in favour of never doing it by default for the CLI...

I would keep error codes off by default for two reasons: **[a]** IMO they are not very helpful in CLI for a regular developer and **[b]** the feature is new and might still ocasianaly evolve (imagine distinguishing between errors and warnings with `"E...."` and `"W...."` respectively), we might consider it as half-experimental.

Ok, we can keep it disabled by default in the commandline.

Can you add the errorCode to the standard-json documentation?
