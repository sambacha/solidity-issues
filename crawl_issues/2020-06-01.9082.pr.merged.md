@cameel I did update according to your comments(well almost all of them). I did fix on as many places as possible to named cast, maybe some places are not a part of PR, but was handy to do it.

This one is left to be just enabling cmake flag.

We need first to merge #9104, #9097, #9096, #9095, #9093, #9092 before this one. Once all of them are merged, there will be one last check if there are no additional errors with applying flag.

There are still some errors with one build

The generated protobuf is wrong, I think the only solution is to disable the check (via `-Wno-sign-conversion`) for the `ossfuzz` directory.

@leonardoalt @axic Tests are passing now. I added -Wno-sign-conversion only to targets including protoc generated files
