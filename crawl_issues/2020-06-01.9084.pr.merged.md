# [\#9084 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9084) `merged`: Remove dead code from SolidityExecutionFramework::compileContract()

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-06-01 18:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9084):

MInor tweaks after digging into Ewasm compilation.

I think that `parseAndAnalyze()` here won't ever fail because `CompilerStack` parses and analyzes the code first and reports any errors it finds.

And the dead code is buggy anyway. Apart from the bug fixed by the first commit, I think that `m_compiler.yulIROptimized({})` will always trigger an assertion. Its argument is not even a real collection (though it's a string which technically works like a collection so it does compile).
