# [\#9089 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9089) `closed`: Emscripten: switch from "fastcomp" to "upstream" backend.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-06-02 09:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9089):

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8909#discussion_r431135953 .
While the new upstream backend for emscripten reduces the size of soljson.js (at the time of writing from about 20MB to about 14MB), thus far it causes "unknown" exceptions to be thrown. IIRC this happens specifically when calling Z3, i.e. for SMT checker calls.

To test this we can build a new emscripten docker image that switches to upstream as explained in the "TODO" comment in ``.circleci/docker/Dockerfile.emscripten`` and use that to compile a broken version of ``soljson.js`` and try to fix it.
