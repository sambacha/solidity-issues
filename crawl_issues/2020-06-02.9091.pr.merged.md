This is now ready for review.

@mijovic you did a pretty good job with it. I thought that I'd be able to get rid of more but I was only able to improve a few things:
- Fixed the wrong parenthesis (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9091#discussion_r433860231)
- Using `0ul` in the lambda eliminated the cast.
- `ClassicGeneticAlgorithm` didn't really require `uint32_t` so I changed it to `size_t`. 
- Eliminated most of the casts in `SimulationRNG` by changing the template arguments.

I put different types of changes in separate commits to make them easier to review. Look at commit messages to see why a particular change was needed.

Looks like tests were failing because of `bernoulli_distribution<book>`. Should be `bernoulli_distribution<double>`.

Also, the tests for the classic algorithm are really slow. I need to check why.

@cameel Can you squash commits, please?

@mijovic I can. But why? I think they add useful information. Each one groups related changes and gives a reason for them.

My personal preference is to have small commits, reflecting the logical steps of implementation. (In particular, I think that having one commit for a comment is perfectly fine.)

But I am not sure if it is in line with solidity repo traditions, which might favor squashing.

I do not have problems with multiple commits, but am used to have one commit per feature as some kind of tradition in solidity repo :)

As a compromise I squashed some of the commits. There are only three now.

Same for me. I always make them very small and only later squash them a little to group it in a way that makes sense. Of course, making sure that each commit is not incomplete, compiles on its own and passes tests. But after that they're usually still pretty small. Apart from grouping changes together it makes it easier to move the code between branches in logical chunks. Or remove part of it if the reviewer requests it.

Well, I've been asked a few times to squash commits but this was mostly when I left them unsquashed just for the sake of review or when I was going back and forth between solutions and wanted to preserve the old solution in history just in case I had to go back to it later. I think this case is different.

Also, one commit rule would be pretty stringent. I often try to make my commits in Solidity a little bigger, but there's usually still more than one logical change per feature.
