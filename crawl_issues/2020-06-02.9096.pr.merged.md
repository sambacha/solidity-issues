@cameel I think I fixed all comments. Would be great to get another review round

There are still failing builds, though.

Might be something weird in some of the CI runs running on merge commits with develop, not on the PR branch, maybe you just have to rebase.

Builds should be fixed now, let's see if CI will pass now

Tests still failing, looks rather weird

@mijovic OK. I'm looking at it now.

@mijovic I looked through all the new changes and everything seems fine to me. The only remaining issue is the failing assertion. But if it was already broken before this PR then I think leaving it as is here and fixing it in a separate PR would be fine too.

CI is *really* weird on this one... why doesn't it start building the linux builds? I was about to say that it's weird that we get that exception only on windows, but the circleci runs don't even start here apparently...
