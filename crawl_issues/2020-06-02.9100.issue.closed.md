# [\#9100 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9100) `closed`: Documentation for reason strings added by `revertStrings`

Is there some place where this is documented?

The motivation here is to see how this could be leveraged by external tools (see https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/issues/624 for example).

The compiler should provide strings for all compiler-generated reverts. This mostly concerns abi decoding.

What do you want to know?

The scope of this errors. Is there a list of those compiler-generated reverts? Or at least some examples to get a better a idea of what they include?

You can search for `revertReasonIfDebug`.

Since this is more a question than a proposal, I'm closing this. The places where reverts happen are documented, but I don't think we should document the exact strings used.
