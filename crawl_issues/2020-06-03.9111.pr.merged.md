In case enabling exceptions in Z3 works out now, we could actually still consider shaping off those 6MB of exception handling code of Z3 by just catching ``...`` as well as ``z3::exception`` around z3 calls (apparently this is what the flag does: exceptions *are* still thrown but without a proper exception object)... but it may be too dangerous - if there's any ``catch`` in Z3 that needs to be working, this would break... EDIT: they *do* catch exceptions by type, so this is out of the question.
