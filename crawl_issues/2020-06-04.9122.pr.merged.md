It still does not check out and it gives me a model that should not meet the rquirements....

I'll add a semantics test.

Is this going in for 0.6.12?

Actually I think that we can generalize this to
`byte(A, SHL(B, X) -> byte((A + B), X)`
or something like that

and then I think we have another step that replaces the byte opcode by `x & 0xff`.

That makes me wonder again, whether for the purpose of simplification we should first transform into a normal form (i.e. replace ``byte`` by ``shr`` + ``and``), then simplify, and then have a fixed transformation back from normal form to compact form (i.e. ``and(A, shr(B, X))`` to ``byte`` for approprate values)...

@ekpyron I'm not sure expanding is something our framework can currently work with...

Nope, this would mean splitting the framework into three parts or changing it in some other way, yeah... but we could keep it in mind for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7520.

Also just rebased to fix a changelog conflict.

Since always? You need to manually add "Co-authored-by: name" to the commit message.

I never really understood under which circumstances - but I definitely know that it doesn't always need "Co-authored-by" - in fact most of the time I squashed or rebased stuff like that it just realized the correct authors on its own... would be interesting how the mechanism works exactly...
EDIT: although maybe git just sometimes auto-adds that to the commit messages, I'm not sure.
EDIT: I'm fine with not having me added as co-author here in any case :-).
