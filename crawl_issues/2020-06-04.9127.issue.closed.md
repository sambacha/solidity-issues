# [\#9127 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9127) `closed`: Change function inlining order

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-06-04 12:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9127):

We often end up with functions being inlined into the main dispatch routine while they call smaller helpers that are not inlined because the dispatch routine is already too large.

Maybe we should start by inlining functions that do not call any other functions (use the call graph).

This is also connected to the idea of optimizing functions in isolation instead of running the optimizer always on the full code.

We could also try to inline a function, run other optimizer steps (especially the more involved rule-based and reasoning ones) and if it did not result in reduction of code size, undo the inlining again.
