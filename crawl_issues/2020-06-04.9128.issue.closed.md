# [\#9128 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9128) `closed`: Check if the stack optimizations in Yul EVM code transform reuses stack slots of function arguments.

In the Yul EVM code transform, whenever a stack variable is no longer used, it's stack slot is marked as available for re-use.
We should check if this also happens for function arguments, i.e. if the code transform uses the slots originally assigned to return variabels, respectively even pops unused function arguments from the stack.
