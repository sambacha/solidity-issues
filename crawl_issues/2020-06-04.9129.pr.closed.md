fix #9099

I'm not quite happy with the duplication of the stuff ``Type::validForLocation`` does for arrays and structs and ``structureSizeEstimate``. Can you improve ``Type::validForLocation`` to cover all these cases instead? Annoying thing is that mappings don't inherit from ``ReferenceType``...
That would probably mean moving ``validForLocation`` from ``ReferenceType`` to ``Type`` and implementing it for mappings as well, which would raise the question what to have it do for value types...

The other direction, i.e. moving what ``validForLocation`` does to the static analyzer is not good either - we had ICEs because of such checks happening too late...

Any good ideas in that direction :-)?

Is this obsolete now?

The test case in this PR still fails (causes an assert) with current develop

It overlaps with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9062/, though, doesn't it?

Ah, I thought we merged that already. Yes they overlap and the test works correctly with the linked PR (just checked)
