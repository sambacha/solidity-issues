# [\#9133 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9133) `closed`: Incomplete sourcemaps for constructors when immutables are used
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `protocol design :crystal_ball:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176499?u=727c007c0698f1632e98401987d52b129fcf1474&v=4" width="50">[alcuadrado](https://github.com/alcuadrado) opened issue at [2020-06-04 22:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9133):

I think there's a bug that makes solc output fewer source maps than instructions. Not that it's emitting sourcemaps that don't point to a file, but there's just fewer source maps than instructions.

I believe this is related to `immutable`, but I can't confirm it.

## Environment

- Compiler version: At least `soljson-v0.6.8+commit.0bbfe453.js` and `soljson-v0.6.9+commit.3e3065ac.js`
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): latest
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Not relevant
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Not relevant
- Operating system: Not relevant

## Steps to Reproduce

Compile this without optimizations using `soljson-v0.6.9+commit.3e3065ac.js`.

```
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract D {
  uint immutable x = 11;
  
  function get2X () public returns (uint) {
    return 2*x;
  }
  
  function fail(uint arg) public returns (uint) {
    revert("D failed");
    return x;
  }

}


contract C {

  function test() public {
    D d = new D();
    d.fail(0);
  }

}
```

The output you get for `D`'s deployment bytecode is:

```json

            "linkReferences": {},

It has 29 source maps, but there are 32 instructions, excluding the final `INVALID`.

Also, I was using the number of source maps to figure out where the actual code ends. Is there another way of doing this?

I think your assessment is correct - the elements in the source maps refer to instructions, but the "assign immutable" pseudo-instruction translates to multiple instructions in the resulting bytecode. This is not too critical, because the source map at this point is usually empty anyway, but we should still fix it.

Your way of finding out where the code ends seems to be pretty solid. You could combine it with a check that there is an invalid opcode right after the code.

The `AssignImmutable` assembly item gets translated into multiple opcodes, also depending on how often the immutable was referred (Assembly.cpp:668). In AssemblyItem::computeSourceMapping we need to take this into account and just add as many `;` as we have opcodes generated from the AssignImmutable. The information about how many refereces we have needs to be retained for that, too.

Can `AssignImmutable` be inlined in the middle of the bytecode? If that's the case, sourcemaps are pointing to incorrectly sections of the code, right?

> You could combine it with a check that there is an invalid opcode right after the code.

I think I'll add this. Thanks

I think I can reply to this myself now:

1. These unmapped instructions are right before the part of the bytecode that returns the runtime bytecode. Like that part, they would have been mapped to the entire constructor.
2. This somewhat reduces the impact of the issue, because it's safe to assume that any unmapped instruction would have the same sourcemap as the latest mapped one.

Can someone confirm this?

Also, if this is correct, I think a workaround to figure out how many instructions there are is to initially decode as many instructions as the number of source maps. Then continue decoding until you see a `0xfe`/`Invalid Opcode`.

Would this work? Can I be sure that no `0xfe` is emitted in that last unmapped part of the deployment bytecode?

You are right, the `AssignImmutable` section should be after any user-generated code and before the runtime bytecode is returned. Tracking `0xfe` should be reasonably safe.

Thanks for your confirmation Chris.

@iamdefinitelyahuman @nebojsa94 this is probably useful for you too.

Actually sorry, #11908 probably also was a problem here (especially in the initial example code), but we still need to fix it by adjusting how AssignImmutable is translated.

@christianparpart while you are at it, can you also update the documentation to state that "verbatim" counts as a single opcode with regards to source maps?

Maybe we should try to fix this fully by changing source maps to byte offsets instead of opcodes, but that would be a breaking change....

The fix in `AssemblyItem::computeSourceMapping` should take `m_immutableOccurrences` into account when it encounters an `AssignImmutable`.
