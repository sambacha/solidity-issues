# [\#9137 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9137) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Erase knowledge when array variable is pushed/popped

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-06-05 12:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9137):

When a reference type variable is assigned (or an index access is assigned), knowledge is erased for all variables of that same type, since they could be references to each other.
This should also be the case when a variable is pushed/popped, but wasn't done for all cases.
The first assertion in the added test is unsafe, but before this PR was considered safe because knowledge wasn't erased.
