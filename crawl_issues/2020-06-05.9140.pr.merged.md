# [\#9140 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9140) `merged`: Fix wrong alignment for Wasm store/load with 8-, 16- and 32-bit arguments

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-06-05 18:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9140):

The [specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/instructions.html?highlight=alignment) says:
> **_t_.storeN _memarg_**
> - (...)
> - The alignment `2^memarg.align` must not be larger than `N/8`.

In our code the alignment was hard-coded to 8 for all `.load`/`.store` instructions.

`wasm-validate` (from wabt) was reporting the following error on the test case included in the PR before the fix:
```
error: alignment must not be larger than natural alignment (1)
```

Based on #9141 for convenience (I want to put #8240 on top of both). Can be rebased on `develop` if needed.
