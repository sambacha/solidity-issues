# [\#9142 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9142) `merged`: Add support for types in Wasm AST and code generation

Prerequisite for #8240.

This PR adds variable and literal types to Wasm AST and makes `BinaryTransform`/`TextTransform` able to use them when generating code. It **does not** enable their use in `WasmCodeTransform` yet so in practice they're always set to "i64" in the AST and generated Wasm code should not change.

This is now ready for another round of review.
