# [\#9143 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9143) `merged`: Add support for ewasm evmc vm.

Closes #8016.

Replaces #9057.

This PR enables the possibility to run tests against `ewasm` evmc vms.
 
In contrast to #9057, where n-evmc vms could be defined, this PR is more simple. It enables the definition of up-to two different evmc libaries. To execute the tests, at least one `evm1` vm must be defined (either through the `--evmonepath` parameter, or with `--vm`), where the defintion of an `ewasm` vm is optional. If an `ewasm` evmc library was defined (via `--vm`), tests will also run against that ewasm evmc vm.

- [X] Basic structure
- [X] SemanticTest: add support for `compileToEwasm`
- [x] Basic CircleCI integration to also run Semantic Tests via ewasm vm (moved to #9212)

@aarlt we are working on landing https://github.com/ewasm/hera/pull/554. It will be released as Hera 0.3.0.

Some test-cases seem to hang inside hera (e.g. `nested_for_loop_multiple_local_vars`). It looks like that this is mainly related to tests using loops that generate infinity loops. Right now metering is not enabled for the ewasm tests. I think some tests hang in hera because of not enabled metering and wrongly generated code leading to infinity loops.

@chriseth I think it's ready. I split out the CircleCI integration #9481 and currently trying to enable as much tests as possible while fixing some polyfills in #9508. From my point of view this PR #9143 and the CircleCI #9481 could get merged. All ewasm based tests are disabled in #9481 and #9143. Related tests get enabled in #9508. 

One thing: I added in a new CircleCI job `t_osx_test` in #9481 that will also run `soltest_all.sh` in osx. If #9508 is passing the tests now, it would be nice to merge #9481 and #9143. And then we can fully focus on getting #9508 ready.

I removed now the `t_osx_test` CircleCI job. Maybe we should think about how to extent the bytecode comparision tests with ewasm.
