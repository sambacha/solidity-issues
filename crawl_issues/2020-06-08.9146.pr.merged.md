Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7739
Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4804 (`canLiveOutsideStorage() -> containsNestedMapping()`)

This is a replacement for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/6282

----------------

For structs and arrays containing nested mappings, the following are disallowed.
1. It cannot be in calldata or memory.
2. If it is a state variable, then it cannot be assigned to.
3. They cannot be constructed. The new operator is also dissalowed.

`containsNestedMapping()` is meant to replace `canLiveOutsideStorage()`. It is only defined for `nameable()` types, calling it otherwise will trigger a `solAssert`.

Can you also write about this in the `mapping` section of the documentation? It might also that we mention that mappings are skipped in the "copying" section.

This looks good! Can you rebase it, please? I think we don't have to wait for the constructor PR.

Argh, sorry - I broke the external tests...
