# [\#9147 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9147) `closed`: SOLC optimizer crash with misleading error message

## Description

SOLC compiler crashes with undescriptive error:
```
Exception during compilation: /solidity/libyul/backends/evm/AsmCodeGen.cpp(225): Throw in function static void solidity::yul::CodeGenerator::assemble(const solidity::yul::Block&, solidity::yul::AsmAnalysisInfo&, solidity::evmasm::Assembly&, solidity::langutil::EVMVersion, const solidity::yul::ExternalIdentifierAccess&, bool, bool)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable value1 is 2 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable value1 is 2 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
```

### Expected Behaviour:
- at a minimum, give source file/method/contract that caused the crash.
   It was very easy to fix the method (and for the sample file below, it was even enough to remove the `pragma experimental` at the top - which I can't in my real project), but without knowing which file to check, it was a very tedious to troubleshoot.
- If possible, fix optimizer (e.g. copy into memory some calldata parameters as needed)

## Environment

- Compiler version: `Version: 0.6.8+commit.0bbfe453.Linux.g++`

- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): solcjs, solc-docker
- Operating system: Mac, Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

`solc --optimize YulOptimizerCrash.sol`
(note that the code passes compilation without `--optimize`)

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier:MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.2;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract YulOptimizerCrash {

    string public constant GENERIC_PARAMS="param";
    string public constant GENERIC_TYPE="type";

    function registerRequestType(string calldata typeName,string calldata extraParams, string calldata subTypes, string calldata subTypes2) external pure returns(bytes memory){
        string memory comma = bytes(extraParams).length > 0 ? "," : "";

        bytes memory str = abi.encodePacked(
            typeName, "(",
            GENERIC_PARAMS, comma, extraParams, ")",
                subTypes, GENERIC_TYPE, subTypes2
        );

        return str;
    }
}
```

The "stack too deep" error means that you have too many local variables (including parameters). The general recommendation is to use a struct instead of multiple function parameters. I know this is not ideal and the error message could be better.

I'm closing this since we already have other issues about the same problem.

The issue is not the "stack to deep": it's the error message: it should give the developer a clue where in the source tree to look for.
Without source file (and if possible, method it like number), it's very hard to find the cause and fix it.

@drortirosh Yes, that's what I meant with "error message could be better" - sorry for being sloppy.
