I think the test case should be added in the first commit and the second commit introduces the change *and* updates the test case, so it is clear what changed in the output.

I'm wondering if this is the only path in our code that leads to 2 `convertType`. I couldn't find more, still wondering.

What is missing here?

@chriseth are we merging this for 0.6.12?

I tried adding the following test case:
```
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(avoid_double_cleanup)
{
	char const* sourceCode = R"(
		contract C {
		  function f() external {
				bytes memory amount;
				bytes24 zero_bytes24;
				bytes32 signature_root;
				bytes32 node = sha256(abi.encodePacked(
					sha256(abi.encodePacked(amount, zero_bytes24, signature_root))
				));
		  }
		}
	)";
	compileBothVersions(sourceCode, 0, "C", 50);
	// This is counting in the deployed code.
	BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(numInstructions(m_nonOptimizedBytecode, Instruction::AND), 9);
	BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(numInstructions(m_optimizedBytecode, Instruction::AND), 7);
}
```

The problem is the `m_nonOptimizedBytecode` check always has 9 instead of 7 and that mismatches my tests using `solc`. The resulting bytecode seems to be very different (I was only able to compare at the hex-binary output). I compared both deployed and non-deployed code from solc.
The optimized code looks more similar, matching the deployed code except for some small block which is likely some metadata..

Is there a reason why this is still in draft mode?

Nope, It was just originally you who put it in draft mode so I figured you have the criteria in mind for when to "undraft" it ;)
