# [\#9151 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9151) `merged`: Refactor the index assignment logic in wasm::BinaryTransform

The way functions/globals/types are passed around in `BinaryTransform` is not very obvious. At times it looks as if the same thing is passed to the same function twice in different ways (as noted by @axic in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9142#discussion_r436198061 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9142#discussion_r436198299). I tried refactoring it a bit.

At minimum, the names could be clearer. The first commit does just that. I tried also moving some bits into separate functions, making some members constant (to make it clear that they're never reassigned in contrast to others) and even getting rid of passing the values via member variables.

One more thing I could do would be to extract the code for processing function definitions while walking the AST into a separate class. This is the only part that needs to access member variables and it has virtually no common parts with the code that generates sections (maybe except for the enums and small utility functions defined in the `.cpp` file). But the changes in this PR may already be enough or even too much so for now I decided not to do it.

When reviewing please look at individual commits. if some of them require more discussion, let me know and I'll put them in a separate PR (or remove them) so that this one can be dealt with quicker.

I'm going to remove the prefix. I also need to fix the tests before this can get merged - looks like some actual change slipped into the generated code which should not be the case with a refactor.

Yes, the rest looks good - but we do have a test failure...

Tests fixed. PR ready for another round.
