This PR helps https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8950 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9041 against z3's nondeterminsm

Actually ``division_5`` is an improvement, isn't it? ``c = a*b`` *can* overflow, can't it? Why *wasn't* that reported before :-)?

@ekpyron the `division_5` test is correct because the `require` after the overflow prevents it from reaching the end of the function, so the overflow always reverts, thus not reported. This was done intentionally back then, so that it wouldn't report a bunch of false positives for every code that uses SafeMath.

Ah, ok, then I guess we have to figure out why it fails now. Can you give me the model for the overflow happening there?

Ah wait, I spoke too soon.
What I said in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9159#issuecomment-641231057 is what *should* happen.
It could be the case that this is also related to using or not CVC4.

I'd say no changelog. Updated.
