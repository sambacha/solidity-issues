# [\#9162 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9162) `merged`: Memory Escalator

~~Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9584 now.~~ (merged)
Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5766 for the subgraph of the callgraph without directed cycles (i.e. without recursive function calls) and without dealing with function arguments/return values.

Maybe "Memory Escalator" is not the best name by the way :-D.

Also a small remark: This will actually also work, if there *are* cycles in the call graph, as long as there is no cycle that itself contains a function that needs memory variables. I.e. this is perfectly fine:

```
{
{
  sstore(0, f(512, 512))
}
function f(v, w) -> v {
  if gt(v, 100) { g(v - 1, w) }
  h()
}
function g(v, w) -> v {
  if gt(w, 100) { f(v, w - 1) }
  h()
}
function h() {
  let a1...a17 := ... // require some memory variable
  ... ...
}
}
```

I.e. the call graph contains a directed cycle "f -> g -> f". But the edges ``f -> h`` and ``g -> h`` are not part of the cycle, so it's not a problem. ``h`` can still use statically assigned fixed memory locations.

I think I'll switch this back to my original algorithm that walks back-edges from leaves. I think forward-assigning won't work out.
EDIT: at least I have to visit children first.

By the way, one important thing is to also get this working for the abiv2 coder in the old codegen!

Hm... that complicates things *a lot*, since there we don't have a memory init...

Is it really that complicated? You could return the required init memory shift in `CompilerContext::optimizeYul`

I'm not sure, I'd need to check - but it'd need to interact with immutables - and we'd need to think about whether it should also be done for inline assembly then.

This isn't complete yet (e.g. it's still actually unused), but I'm marking it as "ready for review", because it could (hopefully) be a reasonable first step.

Would be nice to get somehow #9575 merged so that the optimisation output would be checked.

Maybe, yeah, but for this PR I'm rather worried about semantic correctness, not about syntactic correctness actually :-).

Well you also need more semantic tests :)

Well, so far in this PR it's not actually enabled in the optimizer suite, so it only can be tested as individual step... but yeah @chriseth and I just said, I'll rebase this now and then try to enable it in the suite somewhere to see what happens and then we decide how to continue :-).

Note to self: the ``StackToMemoryMover`` right now only works for functions, not for the outermost block, that needs a small fix. Apart from that only https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9579 blocks this from being (non-vacuously) activated.

@leonardoalt posted this earlier in the channel: https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkex-contracts/blob/master/evm-verifier/solidity/contracts/dex/DexConstraintPoly.sol
which is a crazy example of a contract using custom memory management in a fallback function, which is perfectly legitimate... (and there's definitely less crazy versions of this pattern around).

Now I'm wondering: if some variable in that inline assembly block ran out of stack, then the memory escalator / stack limit evader would move it to memory, but since the fallback function uses custom memory management, this will utterly break...
I guess we need to think about/decide how to deal with this issue before merging this...

Should we somehow exclude the fallback function here? Should we have some way to indicate that an assembly block does custom memory management? Should we just keep this be the responsibility of whoever writes something like this (which might be very dangerous, since in 99% of cases this will just work, but then adding another variable somewhere can break things...)? Should we exclude functions with any ``mstore`` in inline assembly?

The solution would be clearer, if we had memory objects - then we could just assume that solidity memory management is used, unless inline assembly contains ``mload`` or ``mstore``...

At the moment I think I'd go for disabling this for any function containing a inline assembly block with an ``mstore`` until we have memory objects.

Maybe it would make sense to enable/disable the memory escalator explicitly

We had a long discussion on gitter about naming `freememorystart`, and `memoryguard` seems to be a better option. It triggers the need to look it up in the documentation, while `freememorystart` would leave people thinking "i'm sure that means what i think it means". There is also a need to document these things better than they are in the PR.

I now did the renaming to ``memoryguard``, IR codegen now *doesn't* put in the ``memoryguard``, whenever it sees inline assembly (we can be more lenient in subsequent PRs), and I added some documentation about the builtin and especially it's user-facing behavior to ``docs/yul.rst``.

@leonardoalt I think I addressed all your comments - but I'll now start splitting up this PR into pieces that may not make much sense on their own, but may still be easier to review one step at a time, to finally get this really moving :-).

@chriseth Unless you still want me to write something in the docs as you brought up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9162#discussion_r490230921, I think I handled everything you asked for.

I'd vote for dropping the last commit that removes the distinction between multi-assignments and multi-variable-declarations and the single-variable cases, because it doesn't *really* simplify things all that much to treat them the same.
