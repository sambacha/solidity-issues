# [\#9170 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9170) `closed`: Allow conversion from bytes to bytesNN
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

Allow conversions from the dynamic ``bytes`` type to the fixed bytes ``bytesNN`` types.

Probably best to start with ``calldata`` to support e.g. ``bytes4 sig = bytes4(msg.data[:4]);`` (resp. ``bytes4 sig = bytes4(bytes(msg.data[:4]));``, i.e. for proper calldata arrays first and then directly on calldata slices).

But this also makes sense for ``memory`` and ``storage``.

There may very well be an existing issue for that, but I didn't find any on a quick search.

invalid opcode if the byte array is too short?

I'm wondering if we shouldn't just allow conversions from too long (truncating) as well as from too short (padding) `bytes` arrays.
Wouldn't that be more consistent with how explicit conversions work **right now** for any other types?
Is the fact we *might* change other types in a future version a good reason for introducing inconsistencies now?

EDIT: (I'm for example not yet sure if I won't argue against checks on conversions in 0.9 and for a notion of explicit `safe_convert` or something like that instead... - on the other hand maybe not, since explicit masking is maybe also not too bad for other types, but then we'd need to sort memory slicing for this here...)

We discussed new casting/conversion syntax [here](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5f63d5a3ce5bbc7ffdd03d46) and [here](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=6076e59381866c680c22168c):

> We could consider C++ism `cast<byte[]>(cast<byte[32]>(cast<uint256>(1234))`) to make it worse  (or use `convert<>`)
> And add copyof on top of it: `cast<byte[]>(copyof cast<byte[32]>(cast<uint256>(1234)))`
> `uint256(1234).as<byte[32]>().as<byte[]>()` may be a bit more readable :)

> I thought we had an issue proposing a syntax something like `cast<toType>(val)` instead of explicit conversions. I guess it is just more verbose so people would dislike it?
> But at least would probably be easier to read `cast<address payable>(..)` than `address payable(..)`.
> If we do have cast<> as an unchecked casting, then we could later consider adding convert<> which does checks.
> I wonder if we could use the cast syntax for multiple-step casting, i.e. `cast<uint128,int128,int16>(..uint256 input..)` or `cast<uint128 -> int128 -> int16>(..uin256 input..)` (similar to the mapping syntax)
> But the other option we briefly discussed is explicit casting works like static_cast/reinterpret_cast and we could introduce truncation/conversion helper on the types, i.e. `bytes32.truncateFrom(<dynamic bytes>)`.
> Instead of the multiple step casting I suppose there could be nicer helpers in the stdlib doing that?

On the meeting we also mentioned perhaps we should not name them `cast`, but rather `truncate` and `extend`, etc.
