# [\#9176 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9176) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Add redundant type constraints to assertion block

This PR readds the type constraints for all state, input and output variables at the assertion point.
The reasoning is that sometimes the solver can't reuse these constraints that are added at the constructor, for example, because of how the queries are modeled - with nonlinear Horn clauses.

This isn't super important and doesn't help against nondeterminism, so closing for now.
