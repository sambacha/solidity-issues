How did the error ID clash come to pass? That cannot have happened randomly can it?

@hrkrshnn @a3d4 any idea about how the error id clash happened?

This is the relevant PR for the second change: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9039/files#diff-b59e90af07a5bfbe4dcad2c8eaa50776

My guess is that the `m_errorReporter.error(...)` was copy-pasted from few lines below and the error id was not changed :)

For the first one, I think, 1878 was the error id generated when running the script in breaking. Later in develop, 1878 was generated elsewhere.

Error codes can be used for error coverage, but current infrastructure does not guarantee their persistence. Maybe we should improve it.

@a3d4 I think this can be solved by adding the error ID into the error reports of the syntax tests.
