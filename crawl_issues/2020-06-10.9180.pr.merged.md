That's a funny change... in 0.5 we made it an error *not* to specify visibility for constructors  - and now 0.7 turns it around completely :-). But it does make sense to go that way.

I put this on hold again until we have some feedback about whether people need internal types in base constructors.

The external contracts need to be upgraded. It also makes sense to add this in solidity upgrade. I'll have a look.

Colony and Gnosis will work now. But Zeppelin is designed to compile from the nightlies. So it compiles off `solidity-0.6.10`.

I changed this to make visibility for constructors optional. If a visibility is specified, it has to be consistent with the "abstractness" of the contract, though: internal constructor can only be used in abstract contract and public constructors can only be used in non-abstract contracts. The original logic still applies: If the constructor uses an internal type, the contract has to be abstract.

Updated and hopefully fixed build.

Updated after the EVM version test fix.

Looks like one test still needs update.
