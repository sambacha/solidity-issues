Ok the equivalent of counting dynamic arrays as "1" for mappings that would fix the tests, would be to generally count mappings as "1" as well, instead of as the size of their value type...
But maybe we should discuss a bit more what we're actually trying to achieve with this estimate...

I mean the old estimate doesn't really make sense - e.g. it did complain for
```
struct P { uint256[2**63] x; }
struct S {
  P[2**62] y;
  P x;
}
```
but at the same time ignored:
```
struct P { uint256[2**63] x; }
struct S {
  P x;
  P[2**62] y;
}
```
These cases the new estimate will definitely handle better.

Tactically, I am trying to avoid exception/assert later in `StorageOffsets::computeOffsets`.

> These cases the new estimate will definitely handle better

That was a minor fix - we just have to remove the struct from `_structsSeen` after ascending.

As far as I can tell after reviewing it: every encountered struct was being added to `_structsSeen` and never removed. When `structureSizeEstimate()` was visiting a field of a type that was already in `_structsSeen`, the field was being ignored and 1 was returned. See @ekpyron's example above - the current implementation would give different results depending on the order in which `x` or `y` are listed inside the struct - because both have types containing `P` and only the first one gets actually counted.

There's also a semi-related change mixed in: for a dynamically-sized arrays the function would return the size of its element. Now it just returns 1 - I assume that's because it's just a pointer/reference which requires exactly one slot inside the struct. It would be nice if this was a separate commit to make it more apparent that it's fixing a separate issue.

Sorry, that was not communicated properly. This comment illustrates the issue pretty well:

Also, I think that it would be useful to have a test that runs this function on a struct with a few different types inside it, including nested structs, mappings, arrays and function pointer and compares the result with the expected size. Though I'm not sure if it's easy to do without constructing the AST by hand which would be pretty tedious.

Sure, but it might be a separate PR.

There is already a long dependency chain :). The current PR is needed to move the logic of `StaticAnalyzer::structureSizeEstimate` to `Types::storageSizeEstimate()`. That, in turn, is required for PR #9062 (which is connected to PR #9129). And then I could come back to #9007 :).

@ekpyron 
This PR was intended merely to fix the recursive check. But in addition we changed size for `Type::Category::Mapping` to 1. And I would like to be sure that it is OK. I believe @chriseth has some ideas here, but I'm not sure any more.

>  if we add back suitable checks to catch arrays with large base types some other way

As soon as this PR is finished, I plan to continue with PR #9062.

I'm mainly concerned about these two cases not being errors anymore: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9187/files#diff-f44fe50742b220245cbcf17f0c463994

`uint[200][200][2**30][][2**30]` should be an error if and only if `uint[200][200][2**30][2**30]` or maybe `uint[200][200][2**30][200][2**30]` is an error

I think it would be good to add a storage case for ``validForLocation`` in this PR. That will reintroduce these errors.

I did not quite get it. Let `N` be sufficiently big. Which cases should fail due to oversizing?
```
/*a*/ uint[1][][N];
/*b*/ uint[N][][1];
/*c*/ uint[N][];
/*d*/ uint[][N];
```

Now, let `N * M` be huge, while `N` and `M` are OK. Should the following case fail too?
```
/*e*/ uint[N][][M];
```

Actually spending some more thoughts on it: `[A][][B]` should be fine if `[A]` and `[B]` are fine.

What we want to avoid here is a collision attack. Since a has is computed each time we step from the `B`- to the `A`-array, we should have as much control over the location as we have just with `[A]`. Maybe actually we could even ignore `[B]`, since `T[][B]` is essentially the same thing as `mapping(uint => T)`.

Ah, ok if `B` in `uint[A][][B]` is large, then you can at least force a collision in the lengthes of the dynamic arrays. So maybe the following rules:

Everything that is stored contiguously (statically-sized arrays and structs) should not be "too large", where the size multiplies for statically-sized arrays inside statically-sized arrays and statically-sized arrays inside structs.

```
check(X):
  if size(X) > 2**60: error

size(T[k]):
  k * size(T)
size(T[]):
  check(T) // call it to cause error
  return 1
size(struct S):
  sum(size(m) for each member m)
size(mapping(T => U)):
  check(U) // call it to cause error
  return 1
```

Then, the struct case needs to handle recursive structs again like:
```
size(struct S):
   if alreadySeen(S):
     return 1
   else:
     alreadySeen.insert(S)
     r = sum(size(m) for each member m)
     alreadySeen.erase(S)
     return r
```
Or something like that. Maybe needs some care like that in the mapping case as well. But yeah, probably no way around handling recursive structs here then, and with that, this should work fine!

@chriseth So we basically have two separate things:
* checking size of continuous objects, regardless of their location;
* returning expected storage size?

RIght? And we just implement both things within the same function, `StaticAnalyzer::structureSizeEstimate`.
