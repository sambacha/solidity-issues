(hopefully) fixed.

Updated. It got shorter but also more difficult to review. Your choice! ;)

Hm... Here `errorWatcher` makes things different, but not necessarily better. Would c9a75c4 from PR #9206 be simpler?  It is also similar to several other cases in `TypeChecker` where we use lambdas to get error descriptions.

I was not sure if I should push to your PR, so made my own. Feel free to close it, if you want.

There are two PRs for this now: this and #9206 . I'm just wondering which one to review :-)

I cannot convince myself that the variant with the error watcher is better in the given situation. It indeed shortens code, but lack of early returns makes it harder to maintain.

Also, we have cases where we return `false` without emitting an error. So the first commit (5fdbb5c) is an improvement and might be already sufficient. (Yet we might want to refactor `TypeChecker::visit(InlineAssembly)` more in future, I guess.)

Reset to the first commit only.
