Fixes #8456

In some places it is not possible to call function so, I split old function to assembly and function.
Where we were able to call function it is called, the rest is left with assembly inserted as it was before.

Also, I noticed that yul util function  that is being called with `CompilerContext::callYulFunction` can't have a call to another yul function in its body.

I think the failing CI here is a false positive (complains about `ubuntu20.04-2` image not being present which I doubt because other PRs are passing). Perhaps a rebase should "fix" it
