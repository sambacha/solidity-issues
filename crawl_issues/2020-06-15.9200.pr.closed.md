Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7799

TODO
1. [ ] Write more test cases. For `movableIfStorageInvariant` and function side effects.
2. [ ] New PR about `staticcall` and `returndata`

Maybe we should do the same with `memory` right away.

Maybe we should do this properly, meaning that we collect multiple things that could be invalidated:
 - storage
 - memory
 - returndata
 - other blockchain state

and then query if an instruction is movable across other instructions with a certain set of "invalidations".

The "invalidates" could just be the SideEffects of the other code.

I tried the "compute sum of storage array" manually and it actually works with some tweaks to the inliner!

The only problem is that it runs `sload(0)` twice before the loop:
```
let _2 := sload(_1)
let _3 := sload(_1)
```
If `sload` would be a movable function, it would be replaced by
```
let _2 := sload(_1)
let _3 := _2
```
in the CommonSubexpressionEliminator or more specifically in the DataFlowAnalyzer.

Interestingly, the DataFlowAnalyzer already stores information for `SSTORE`, but if we have `let _2 := sload(_1)`, then this is actually the same information as `sstore(_1, _2)`. I'll try to modify the data flow analyzer accordingly!

The double sload is handled in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9271
