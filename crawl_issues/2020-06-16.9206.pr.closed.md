Hm, a lambda inside a lambda?

I tried to combine the two lambdas locally, but there still remains the problem that we would also have to return the kind of error (declaration, type, ...). So I think the solution where we directly emit the error is better.

The root PR is 9189, here is an alternative implementation.

I thought we can consider all errors as type errors. Anyway, I'm closing this PR then.
