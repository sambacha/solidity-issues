**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `fuzz blocker`

## Description

```
contract H {
  int immutable z = z = 5;
}
```

throws

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b9c9535647f649cec72d966a23678745de6b2bb9/libsolidity/analysis/ImmutableValidator.cpp#L38

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc <input.sol>
```

## Notes

- Since immutable declaration's value RHS (`z = 5`) is visited before LHS (`z`), the set of initialized state variables inside `ImmutableValidator` class already contains `z` at the time of visiting the LHS and the assertion fails.

- I think immutable declarations referencing themselves should be disallowed as we do for vanilla variable declarations (i.e., throw a declaration error `undeclared identifier` for `z` in RHS immutable expression `z + 5`)
