# [\#9215 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9215) `merged`: Fix pragma solidity version in antlr grammar

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-06-17 03:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9215):

Previously, `pragma solidity > 0`, `pragma solidity > 0.0` or alike were not recognized by **Solidity.g4** grammar.

The problem was that the same input (e.g. `[0-9]`) could be `DecimalNumber` or `VersionLiteral`. The lexer makes its decision, and the parser gets an unexpected token.

The lexer _could_ have different modes (a pragma mode and the default mode) and produce proper tokens. But that would require pure lexer and pure parser grammars, instead of a the current compound lexer+parser one.

While separating lexer and parser grammars might be the right thing to do in the long run, here is a quick workaround. (Note that it allows `pragma solidity > .0`. Easy to fix, but would make rules a bit messy.)

Why are we trying to provide a comprehensive grammar rule for the pragmas? A lot of things are not covered by the grammar, but rather solved in analysis later.

.sol files that pass the analysis phase of the compiler should also pass the grammar.
.sol files that pass the grammar do not need to pass the analysis phase of the compiler.
(the grammar is less strict).

The problem here is that `pragma solidity >0;` is correctly accepted by the compiler but it is rejected by the grammar.

@a3d4  Have a look at the following proposal:

```diff

the top..mid of the diff of this diff is most interesting. The name changes were just a cleanup to state that those rules are **only** used inside the pragma parsing.

@ christianparpart 
> Have a look at the following proposal:

I think it does not impact the lexer and hence does not fix the original problem. Or did you suggest it just as a general grammar improvement?

@a3d4 did you answer my questions from before the weekend?

@chriseth We were looking at three options:

> I see three main options now:
(a) to do things in a correct way, with a separate lexer grammar (might require disproportional amount of efforts);
(b) to ignore whatever goes after pragma solidity;
(c) to keep ethereum/solidity#9215, possibly with minor adjustments.

> But if we go for (b) or (c), I'd prefer to minimize the hack. What do you think?

You asked about (b), and I suggested somethink like brutal
```
pragmaDirective
  : 'pragma' pragmaName ( ~';' )* ';' ;
```

I thought I'm waiting for your feedback, did you think the same?

Oh I'm sorry! Yes if that works, it sounds like a good solution to me because this is also what the solidity parser does (I thought I wrote that down somewhere)...

Yes, you did. But I took it as a side remark rather than a suggestion to go, sorry!
