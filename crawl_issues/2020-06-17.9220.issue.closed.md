Since we advocate for this in Solidity programs, we should bite the bullet and also include it in all the compiler source code ðŸ™Š

Hey,
I would like to work on it. Do you have any more information about it?

@sacgrover thanks for wanting to help out! I think what @axic meant is adding the appropriate
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
```
to all source files of the compiler that are GPL-3-licensed.

One Question, SPDX-License-Identifier will always be GPL-3.0 or it can have different value?
and when we say source files. Does it mean abis json that get created?

If the license snippet in that file is gpl, then it is gpl. I think we might also have some mit files.
