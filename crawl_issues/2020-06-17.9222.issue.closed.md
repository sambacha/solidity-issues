And have it also tested like Solidity's.

Should also consider merging the grammar for Yul and "Yul Objects".

Closes #4622.

It is part of the Solidity antlr grammar - can we somehow reuse it?

I just looked at it, but don't think so. Also the Solidity one is very liberal (supports jump labels) as it tries to parse really old sources too.

I have moved the grammar from `yul.rst` and used the low level stuff from `Solidity.g4`.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
