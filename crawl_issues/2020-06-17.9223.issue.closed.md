	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
The following contract, when compiled with `solc --ast-compact-json`, produces an incorrect source mapping for the `YulVariableAssignment` node:

```
contract A {
    fallback() external {
        assembly
{
  let a, b
  a, b := f()
  function f() -> r1, r2 {}
}
    }
}
```

With unix line endings, solc reports the src of the assignment node to be `74:8:0` which corresponds to `b := f()`. It should probably be `71:11:0`.

## Environment

- Compiler version: `0.6.10+commit.00c0fcaf.Linux.g++`
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--

Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.
