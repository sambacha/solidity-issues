I'm not quite sure how to review it :).

What do you think about having the id after, say, TypeError? The error message would look like `TypeError 1111: (1-2): ...`

I would also prefer the error id being mentioned right after the error "kind".

Review should be easy: Just run it locally and see if there is any difference.
