Thank you @cameel and @chriseth for your feedback. I have incorporated most of your comments. `printSource` for semantic tests now prints all sources (instead of only the main source file). However, it does not diagnose syntactic errors (if any) in semantic tests. This feature may be useful when one is initially writing a semantic test, however I feel it is a separate PR :)

" it does not diagnose syntactic errors" - is that a regression?

I haven't checked git history but I doubt that it is a regression. I feel parsing errors in semantic tests were previously ignored.

Edit: I was mistaken. semantic test's `printSource` counterpart *does* diagnose syntactic errors. It only does not colour format the warnings/errors as syntactic test framework's `printSource` does.

I mistook the formatting code (orange text for warnings and red for errors) to be error diagnosis code. So please ignore my previous comment in this regard.

So what is missing in semantic test framework is syntactic error *colour highlighting*

They result in a failed assertion. Parsing errors are printed first though. Did that change now? It would definitely made debugging harder.

> I have one more suggestion and I think you have missed [#9228 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9228#discussion_r443763723) (github folds it under `Load more...`) but I'm already marking as approved because all the more important points have been addressed and it looks fine overall.

Done :) Thank you for the reviews!
