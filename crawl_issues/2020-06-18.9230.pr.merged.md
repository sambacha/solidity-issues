> test/tools/ossfuzz/config/solidity.dict (not sure about this one, but I see other unit names in it; @bshastry?)

Yes, please add "gwei" to the solidity fuzzing dictionary. This dictionary is used by the fuzzer to use solidity keywords in test case mutations.

With the new changes it looks fine to me (except for the one thing mentioned by @chriseth above).

@chriseth @axic so I think I got it working. The only problem left is the antlr grammar. So far I failed to find a solution that works with

```
contract C {
	uint constant gwei = 1 gwei;
}
```
but I poked @christianparpart maybe he can help

I managed to solve the grammar problem. Not exactly the nicest solution, but it works.
