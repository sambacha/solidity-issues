Moving this to draft because likely it will change significantly after #7646 and its related PRs.

@chriseth I'll fix your comments as well in this round.
I have one more bug to solve, that is why I am still leaving this as draft.

I also reviewed my earlier suggestions and added comments to some of them. Unfortunately Github folds most of them.

@cameel Fixed assembly test to have `sub_x.sub_y`. I think I also fixed all of your suggestions.

Reviewed. Here are the remaining things that either need to be fixed or just have not been addressed (maybe you missed them due to github hiding some comments):
- [CompilabilityChecker](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9235#discussion_r457983385)
- [Add info in the docstring that `ObjectNode.name` can be an empty string](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9235#discussion_r457990750)
- [assert about path prefix in pathToSubObject()](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9235#discussion_r457432229)
- [YulString as parameter type in pathToSubObject()](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9235#discussion_r442997342)
- [request for extra tests](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9235#discussion_r443004672)
