# [\#9236 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9236) `closed`: WIP: Natspec parsing moved into solidity parser for better error reporting

This PR isn't finished.

This PR moves the structured-documentation parsing up into the Solidity parser for more precise error parsing. It's not fully done yet, I've left some TODOs (especially in the project root there is a file).

It is for early (structural) feedback, and a few things I've not deleted inside yet in case I need them again (e.g. debug prints).

I'm not sure it is a good idea to make the regular parser parse comments. Would it be possible to get source locations by firing up a second parser and scanner and just transferring the locations?

I actually considered that. but the initiating ticket did read different. It should certainly be less intrusive.

I think the problem with this is the newlines within comments. In general, this whole ticket sounds to me to have a rather low return on investment.

I'm currently rewriting it with regards to your above suggestion (pass source location to `DocStringParser`), which seems to be what I have done from the beginning (much less overhead).

Closing since the benefit is not too big.
