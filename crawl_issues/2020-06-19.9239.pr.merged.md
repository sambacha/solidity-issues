# [\#9239 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9239) `merged`: [Yul] Allow string literals longer than 32 bytes in builtin calls that require literal arguments

Part of #8078. Prerequisite for #9240.

We need to lift this restriction to be able to implement `linkersymbol()` builtin to Yul and have it work with fully qualified library names, which may be longer than 32-bytes.

I just pushed a slightly improved version that needs only a single boolean flag rather than a list of all encountered literals used as literal arguments for the `AsmAnalyzer` check.

Fixed. I pushed it just after rebasing and turns out it was missing the newly introduced error IDs in error messages.
