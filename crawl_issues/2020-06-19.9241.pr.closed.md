Forked the project and currently working on translating the documentation. Hopefully this the correct way of adding a new editions. I am new to open source communities and this is my first contribution if all good. Thanks :)

Hello. First of all, welcome in the community and thanks for your contribution!

Creating a fork of the repository is a great first step. That's where the translation will live. Since the translations are a volunteer effort and we can't make any guarantees about them being up to date, they're not merged into the main repository. We can link to it though and that's what your PR should really contain.

We usually create a new issue to coordinate the effort. This way you might also find other people willing to help. This is something to talk about with @ChrisChinchilla. You can see other ongoing translations here: [translations üåç](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/labels/translations%20%F0%9F%8C%8D).

If you have more specific questions you can find us on the [solidity channel on gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) which is also a good place to casually ask about anything related to Solidity (including translations).
