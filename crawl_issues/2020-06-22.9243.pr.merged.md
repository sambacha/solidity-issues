@yann300 @haltman-at @alcuadrado @iamdefinitelyahuman 

This adds the "jump into" / "jump out of" tags also to `jump` / `jumpi` opcodes coming from yul functions, so this affects the ABI coder, inline assembly and so on. Can you please check if this breaks anything for your framework and / or is useful for you?

We still have to adapt our test suite to 0.6.9, so I can't be completely sure about it, but I think this will need some changes in Buidler. We track jump into and returns, to create something similar to a callstack. This change will introduce jump into without the "file" field of the sourcemap and will probably break a few things.

I run the tests with the compiler you linked, and I can only see a new failure wrt 0.6.9, and it's because of sourcemap without a file.

Here's the tests:

File `c.sol`:

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

import "./d.sol";

contract C {
  function test() public {
    D d = new D();

    d.fail();
  }
}
```

File `d.sol`:

```Solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract D {
  struct MyStruct {
    uint x;
    uint y;
  }

  function fail() public returns (MyStruct[] memory)
  {
    revert("D failed");

    MyStruct[] memory structs = new MyStruct[](2);
    structs[0] = MyStruct(1, 2);
    structs[1] = MyStruct(2, 3);

    return structs;
  }
}
```

Deploy C, and call its `test` function.

No issues on my end.  In the process of testing this I did discover an issue introduced by `0.6.9`, but it's unrelated to these changes and I've already patched it.  Thanks for the heads up!

@alcuadrado can you be more specific about "source maps without a file"? If the opcode is generated from an internal compiler routine used from multiple places (abi decoder, memory to storage copy routines, ...) the source file was always specified as `-1`. The change introduced in 0.6.9 was that in some circumstances, the source reference of the solidity statement that triggered the generation of the internal routine was used instead.

By "source maps without a file" I meant "source maps with file `-1`".

I'll give more info about that failing test later today, including the exact source map that makes Buidler fail.

OK, finally had a chance to look at this.  Answer: I don't think this should cause any serious problems for us.  (Which makes sense, as I'm the one who requested it. :) )

Such jumps will cause a bunch of `unknown function` frames to appear in the stacktraces we print out, but that's not, like, a serious incompatibility, and of course I can go ahead and modify the stacktrace code to account for this.

Haven't actually tested this out yet, this is just from looking over our code.  But will try it out as well to be sure!

(Thank you again for this!)

@chriseth Hey, sorry, I've been running into trouble trying to test this -- the binary doesn't work for me (it seems to expect a different version of CVC4 or something?) and I've been running into problems trying to build from source (I've asked about this on Gitter).  Could you perhaps provide a soljson I could perhaps use?  Thank you!

OK, finally tried this out and it works great!  Sorry that took so long.  Like I said, it does add some less-than-informative lines to our stacktraces, but A. I'll fix that, and B. that strikes me as basically acceptable anyway.  Thanks so much!  Now Truffle Debugger's tracking of assembly variables won't get thrown off by recursive functions. :)

Sorry for the delay @chriseth. 

Here's more data about this failing test.

The problem appears when I run a test that uses the files I pasted in [my previous comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9243#issuecomment-647792524).

If you deploy the contract `C` and then call its test function, this is the execution test you get:

```

 error: revert

The instructions that don't have a file and a range have file `-1` in their source map. Internally, in Buidler, we consider those to be unmapped.

The problem is that jumps marked as a jump into a function are unmapped. I guess this are yul functions calling other yul functions, but I don't know how these should be handled. How can/should we show that in our stack traces?

For example, if a yul function (1) calls another yul function (2) and the second one reverts, our stack trace would look something like this:

```
Revert blah blah
    ???? <-- yul function 2 reverting
    ???? <-- yul function 1 calling another yul function
    C#f() (c.sol:123)
```

The "????"s are there to represent the things that I don't know how to handle.

@alcuadrado Oh, huh, now that you bring up that sort of thing, I'm realizing I'm actually going to have to retest with Truffle as well -- I basically only tested the case I requested these for, I didn't really do a full test.  I didn't think about that sort of issue, of jumps in unmapped code.  Going to check again and see how bad this messes things up.  Oops.

For some of these cases, we will have actual yul code to map to (this is done in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9053 ) at some point, but that of course does not solve the general question.

What I can guarantee (apart from bugs) is that a "jump into" is always matched by a "jump out of", so if you do `n` jumps "into" followed by `n` jumps "out of" you are again in the same function (may it be a yul or a solidity function).

I think you can pretty safely identify functions by their entry point. So whenever you have a "jump into" that jumps to PC `x`, you know that the function that starts at PC `x` is called. You can display that more nicely to the user by checking in the source maps where that PC comes from and determine the name of the function through the AST (I guess this is what you are already doing). If you do not have a source location for that PC, you display something like `internal@<PC>`.

Is that what you were asking about, @alcuadrado ?

Oh and actually another open pull request might also be relevant here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8868 outputs the starting PC of all functions together with the names of the functions. If you want, I can also store the names of the yul functions there...

Do you mean that there are no reverts inside yul functions? Or is this excluding reverts and other terminations?

Right now we check the source map of the jump and use that get its function using the AST.

Yes. We'll do this `internal@<PC>`. At least for now. It would be great if we could give more info, like `internal#enconde-struct` (not a real example, of course). Is #8868 a movement in that direction?

Thanks for your answers, @chriseth. I think this PR is a movement in the right direction. Having internal functions being treated as actual functions make everything simpler, despite needing a few changes now.

I was only talking about regular control-flow inside the currently executing "EVM frame". Opcodes like `call`, `stop`, `return` and `revert` are of course different.

> Yes. We'll do this `internal@<PC>`. At least for now. It would be great if we could give more info, like `internal#enconde-struct` (not a real example, of course). Is #8868 a movement in that direction?

Unfortunately, the internal yul functions usually have horrible names. The reason is that most of these functions are ABI coding functions and those functions always contain a description of the type and these are extremely verbose. We have to make sure there is never a collision between two such functions. A shorter example is `abi_encode_t_uint256_to_t_uint256_fromStack`. But yes, #8868 could provide these names even without the full source code that would be provided by #9053.

Ah, that is very good to hear!

It would also be great to get everyone's input on #9053 and #8868 !

I guess that if we get access to those names we can classify them and show that instead. For example, instead of `abi_encode_t_uint256_to_t_uint256_fromStack` show `abiEncoding`.

OK, on retesting with @alcuadrado's example (thanks for that by the way!), I am also seeing issues in Truffle.

Truffle doesn't crash on that jump in marking, though it does display some inelegant messages, which I should fix.  However, I consider that acceptable.

Unfortunately there is another issue: Markings in autogenerated code aren't balanced.  When I debug this transaction, what I find is that, within the autogenerated Yul for the `revert`, there are two jump in markings, but *three* jump out markings.  This messes up the final stacktrace, as it causes an extra stack frame to get popped off.

It looks to me like the final jump out marking that causes the issue is the return from autogenerated Yul back to Solidity.  If that is indeed what's causing the problem, then the obvious way to fix it would be to have the jumps *into* autogenerated Yul from Solidity be marked with a jump in to match.  And indeed it looks like the jump in was not so marked.

So, hopefully changing that will solve the problem?  Otherwise there are always blunter solutions...

Btw, worth noting that unbalanced jump markings like this causes more issues than just bad stacktraces.  I tried running our usual debugger test suite with this build, and I noticed that our test of decoding array slices failed.  On investigation, it turned out to be due to the unbalanced jump markings -- the unbalanced jump markings (since array slicing involves autogenerated Yul) confused the debugger as to which stackframe it was in, and so caused it to go looking for variables in the wrong places on the stack.

Oh hm -- it's also possible for jumps to occur in unmapped Yul code at the beginning of a transaction before the initial jump into the function being called.  That messes with some of our stuff, but in a minor way, and that I'll just consider something I should fix.  So that's not a big deal.  The unbalancing though is a real problem.

Thanks for the find about the unbalanced jumps, that certainly is a real issue. I'll update this and provide you with new binaries once it is fixed.

Just a heads up: I just saw that we used "jump into" and "jump out of" already for some internal routines that are not yul functions but also not solidity functions - so this functionality is there for even older compiler versions.

Interesting, I hadn't encountered that.  Can you give an example?  Is there any potential unbalance problem there?

@haltman-at I can maybe supply a code example tomorrow (or rather next week, sorry), but the following internal routines exist:
 - copy array to storage
 - clear storage array
 - resize dynamic array
 - convert recursive array storage to memory
 - the "always fails assertion" default value for internal function pointers
 - the memory array and struct initialization function
 - the function that copies a contract's code to memory

note that these are inlined by the optimizer unless they are called multiple times, so you need to use the same function on the same type from multiple places to avoid inlining.

I checked and there should be no imbalance.

I see!  OK, so I can construct examples based on those if I want to test them out -- indeed I just did one and it sems to work fine; no unbalance.  So, new version seems to be fine!  Array slice test now passes.

I'll want to make the small adjustments to Truffle Debugger I mentioned, but it's not going to crash or do anything crazy or disastrous.

Thanks again! :)
