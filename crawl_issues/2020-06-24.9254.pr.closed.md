- [X] image creation
- [X] image testing - done by simple compilation of solidity within the freshly created docker
- [X] image pushing
- [ ] check that a version was already pushed. This will prevent accidentally overwriting packages.


# Overview

This PR enables automated builds for our `solidity-buildpack-deps` docker images.

It will trigger docker builds, if a PR is changing the docker files:
- `scripts/docker/buildpack/Dockerfile.emscripten`
- `scripts/docker/buildpack/Dockerfile.ubuntu1604.clang.ossfuzz`
- `scripts/docker/buildpack/Dockerfile.ubuntu1804`
- `scripts/docker/buildpack/Dockerfile.ubuntu2004.clang`
- `scripts/docker/buildpack/Dockerfile.ubuntu2004`

Currently it will also trigger the builds, if the workflow definition files (e.g. `.github/workflows/buildpack-ubuntu1804.yml`) was changed, this may be removed.

Right now the workflows define the following steps:
- Build image
- Test image
- Push image

In the “Build image” step the docker image will be build. “Test image” will run a simple compilation test using this image. And finally “Push image” will push the tested docker image as a GitHub package. The package will be versioned by the version label defined within the corresponding `Dockerfile`.

After publishing a package to GitHub, it is not easily possible to delete this package. A special request form need to be filled for package deletion. However, packages can be overwritten. See https://help.github.com/en/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/deleting-a-package#about-public-package-deletion

I also tested the behaviour if a PR was created by a user where these files are changed, who don’t have write access to the repository. It seem to use the `GITHUB_TOKEN`  of the user, that means everything will be executed correctly, except the push will fail, because of insufficient rights.

## Names, Variant & Versions

Looking at the `solidity-buildpack-deps` Docker Hub repository the tags used there contain not only a “version”, but also the “variant” e.g. `ubuntu2004-clang-1` or  `ubuntu1604-clang-ossfuzz-1`. The GitHub packages will be stored within the `solidity` GitHub repository, probably its better to just use `buildpack` as the package name. I think it would be good if we would have the variants as different packages on GitHub, like `buildpack-ubuntu2004` or `buildpack-ubuntu2004.clang`. For the emscripten buildpack I decided to also put the name of the used emsdk as part of the package name, e.g. `buildpack-emscripten-1.39.15`. See https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/packages/, note that there are also old packages stored that where created during some tests. Packages starting with `buildpack-*` are created with the latest version of the workflow.

Right now the docker images will be pushed to `$GITHUB_DOCKER_REPOSITORY/$IMAGE_NAME-$IMAGE_VARIANT:$IMAGE_VERSION`. As already described the `IMAGE_VERSION` will be extracted from the version label defined in the corresponding `Dockerfile`.

Additionally to the given version, also a `latest` version will be created and pushed. I’m not very sure whether we need this.

Right now the test compilation is failing for `buildpack:ubuntu1604.clang.ossfuzz`. See https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/runs/805073397?check_suite_focus=true with errors like 
```
/usr/local/bin/../lib/libc++.a(memory.cpp.o): In function `std::__1::__sp_mut::lock()':

memory.cpp:(.text._ZNSt3__18__sp_mut4lockEv+0x2e): undefined reference to `pthread_mutex_trylock'
```

@bshastry maybe you know these kind of errors?

@aarlt Could you try if appending `libpthread-stubs0-dev` here solves this issue?

I would be careful with having this as PR here, before we finalize what we want. I think it's better to work on a fork for now, otherwise we'll end up having packages in our repo, that will be annoying to get rid of again...

@ekpyron you're right. I will close this PR for now. I manually canceled the workflows in the past, but if we forget this, its not nice..

Yeah, we need some nice way to discuss this/work on this in the fork :-).
My first comment would have been, that I'd say it's nicer to just use simple revision numbers in the version labels, i.e. just ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, etc. - instead of full-blown versions like ``0.0.0``.

maybe we can just discuss the stuff here in this closed PR? And we reopen if we are ready? The latest code will be available in `docker-workflow` in my repo: https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/tree/docker-workflow.

@ekpyron I think it would be really nice to have somehow an approval mechanism. So if a PR was approved, only then the docker images will be published.

I mean - if we prevent images from being overwritten, i.e. we make sure that the version is incremented by one between develop and PR (hence better to use simple revision numbers than full version numbers by the way ;-)), then it's fine to just publish in the PR directly, isn't it? We do have versions to have CI keep running on the old images as long as we don't update the version number there - and the ``revision on develop plus one`` image we can just overwrite again in another PR (or by changing the same PR) until we're satisfied...

An alternative would be to just build and test the images on the PR and only to publish them after merging to develop... then it would also be a two-PR-mechanism: first create a PR that updates the docker image and after merging that create another PR that updates the version in the CircleCI config...

There's not *that* much reason to bother with approving and permissions in the sense that anyone with write access to the repo can publish and overwrite the packages anyways...
Although thinking about it and the fact that these images will be used to build the releases as well, we could actually consider that to be a problem :-)...

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2020-07-01 17:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9254#issuecomment-652545250):

Actually, us just being able to overwrite the images is not really nice in general...
But there's one thing we can do: we can refer to the images not by their version number, but rather by their sha256 hash for CI and release builds, e.g. as
```
docker.pkg.github.com/ekpyron/solidity/solidity-buildpack-deps@sha256:122a15554e73d276ea2c41761c584e00dae7a590bca0252395053f1467dd2bf6
```

That will be safe against any unnoticed tinkering. We need to come up with a way to make this convenient, though :-).

Yeah... maybe the "nicest", safest workflow would be:
- Create a PR that touches the docker file.
- Actions on that PR merely build the docker image and run tests in it, but don't publish/push.
- When the PR is merged, an action on develop builds the docker image again, tests it again and publishes/pushes it.
- That same action creates a new PR that updates the sha256 hash of the updated docker image in the CircleCI config (and whereever else it is used).

That way it doesn't really matter who has permissions to push to github packages or not and the whole thing is "as safe as" getting a commit to `develop`.

But maybe there's an even nicer way of doing this...
