# [\#9265 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9265) `merged`: Add --examine-coverage to fix_error_ids.py

First iteration of error coverage checking. Needs to be extended, for instance, to detect errors covered by boost tests.

Does it make sense to rename the file to `check_error_ids.py`?

@chriseth regarding the name, we had that discussion already when I added it to the CI I think. We favored the most common (manual) usage, being that it fixes wrong error ideas that new code introduced to be the default.

I would thus still argue for keeping the current name "fix[..]"

All the other scripts are also called `check_`, even if they fix stuff

I wonder if we should run this from the commandline tests...

@Marenz ok if we run this script from the commandline tests (in the same way we run the `update_bugs_by_version.py`) then I don't care how it is called because I will never run it manually :)

I think you _have_ to run it manually when you introduce new errors that you want corrected (I assume you don't want the automated test to modify source files to correct them)

I meant that the commandline test - which I run - will just call the script, so I do not have to remember its name.

I know, but I am saying you _do_ need to remember it if you ever add new errors that will need the correct codes.. or are we talking about different things here?

@a3d4 do you have an opinion on that? Let's not waste too much time on that...

I wanna direct your attention to our previous discussion here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9085#issuecomment-637608018

@chriseth 

>  do you have an opinion on that? Let's not waste too much time on that...

What do you mean? If naming, then
* in general, I would prefer `error_codes --fix`, `error_codes --check`, `error_codes --examine_coverage` or alike;
* for a concrete project, I would follow local customs (so **check_error_codes** is OK if similar scripts start with **check_**).

If you mean remembering the name - I think we have to remember it to run the script manually when new errors are added, as @Marenz  said.

But in either case, I guess we can merge this PR :).

@a3d4 yeah, maybe just calling it `error_codes` is the cleanest approach.
