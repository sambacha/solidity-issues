# [\#9266 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9266) `closed`: Added error codes to InlineAssembly Boost tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-06-28 02:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9266):

Some errors are covered by Boost tests. Here is a possible way to use error codes for error coverage checking.

`CHECK_ASSEMBLE_ERROR` macro is changed for demo purposes.

Note the `_expected` custom literals. They should be detected by the python coverage checker script.

These should be turned into yul syntax tests. The tests in this file use the assemblystack while the yul syntax tests circumvent that. I don't think this is a problem. The main difference I see is that the yul syntax tests do not try to create bytecode for the successful tests, but maybe we could add that.

I agree we should move them over, there is also a lot of overlap already. It was done mostly for the ObjectParser in #9502, but Parser is still untouched.

I suggest we close this PR.

Closing. The primarily goal of the PR was to illustrate possible way to check Boost error coverage. It was not much about `InlineAssembly`.
