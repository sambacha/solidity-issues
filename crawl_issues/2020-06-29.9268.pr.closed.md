# [\#9268 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9268) `closed`: solc: clickable links in file names

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2020-06-29 13:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9268):

### Motivation

I did that because I'm actually seeing a lot of errors when compiling external contracts with latest solc builds. It actually helps a lot in quickly opening those files that contain the error.

### What it does

Adds support for OSC-8 in error diagnostics, that is, you can click the file names in the error reports.

This is by default auto-detected, can be actively disabled (including auto-detection), or forcefully enabled.

A non-supporting terminal will silently ignore the generated hyperlink
anchor and just print the file name.

I think this needs a command-line test.

I'm putting it to draft mode, so I can work on the sourceName-vs-filesystemName concern that chriseth mentioned somewhere in the near future.

* [ ] Ensure hyperlinks are the actual mapping to the sourceName.
* [ ] Local filesystem knowledge must be decoupled from libsolidity, just like file reader already is (as a callback).
* [ ] Could web tooling benefit from such an info, by also annotating error messages with the actual URI?
