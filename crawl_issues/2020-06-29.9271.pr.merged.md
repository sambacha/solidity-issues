@bshastry can you direct your fuzzing laser at this PR, please?

@leonardoalt the test is basically this one: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9271/files#diff-8e73c4b5909be43c9546bc3f14fff470

@chriseth I meant when you wrote
```
 It is currently optimizign sstore(a, b) x := sload(a) -> sstore(a, b) x := b but not b := sload(a) c := sload(a) -> b := sload(a) c := b
```

Ah, got it now, it didn't do that *before* this PR, now it does it

@chriseth Fuzzer didn't find any issue with the diff in this PR. It has been executed a few hundreds of thousands of times already, so if there was something obviously wrong it should have found it by now.

I would like @ekpyron to also take a look here before merging.

I'm vaguely concerned that the fuzzer did not find the issue :)

Rebased and squashed.

Interesting. I can add a mutation for this specific pattern.

I was not able to reproduce this in the original PR, may be I'm missing something.

I think I know why the fuzzer did not find the failing test case: the optimization sequence masked the bug. I'm not sure which step (or a combination) is/are responsible yet.

@chriseth May be we should consider fuzzing individual steps as well? :)

@bshastry yes, maybe :)
