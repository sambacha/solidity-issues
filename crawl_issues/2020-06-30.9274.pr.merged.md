# [\#9274 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9274) `merged`: Yul interpreter: Remove selfbalance constant

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-06-30 11:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9274):

For evm version `>= istanbul`, `balance(address())` is replaced by `selfbalance()`

However, the constants `balance` and `selfbalance` that are hard-coded in the yul interpreter are different. This means, the fuzzer fails on such an optimization because traces may differ.

This PR removes the self balance constant entirely in favour of a single balance constant.

> I think this is dangerous, because it would not trigger an error if we substitute `balance(2)` by `selfbalance()`. Can you check if the argument is the same as the one returned by `Instruction::ADDRESS` and then return one balance, otherwise the other?

Good point, I will do the more precise check as you suggested.
