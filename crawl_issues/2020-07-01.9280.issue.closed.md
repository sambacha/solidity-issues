Looks like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8959 to me but keeping this issue open for now

This is just a regular 'stack too deep' error because of too many arguments to the decode function. Do you want us to change the exception type so that it does not confuse the fuzzer?

Ah sorry, I see you already did that in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9281 :)

Yeah, no worries. I guess what I wanted to ask is if stack estimation can be done at compile time so that these would be compiler errors and not failed assertions? But of course, doing it generally might be more complicated at compile time than I think. So in a way I was thinking out loud here.
