The problem here is how will we write `movableRelativeTo`? (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9200/files#diff-909b4b08c718c708f1f7b0d7ac2bbc32)

This is how, it is written in the other PR:

```cpp
	bool movableRelativeTo(SideEffects const& _blockSideEffects)
	{
		if (movable())
			return true;
		else if (movableIfStateInvariant() && !_blockSideEffects.invalidatesState)
			return true;
		else if (movableIfStorageInvariant() && !_blockSideEffects.invalidatesStorage)
			return true;
		else if (
			movableIfMemoryInvariant() &&
			!_blockSideEffects.containsMSize &&
			!_blockSideEffects.invalidatesMemory
		)
			return true;

		return false;
	}
```

A natural idea is that we can replace `movableIfStateInvariant()` by `m_sideEffects.state < Effect::Write`. But this will create problems for expressions such as `extcodesize(keccak256(x,y))` (because the state of the expression is read, but keccak256 cannot always be moved) A fix for this would be to assign the state of `keccak256` to be `state::write`, but this is worse.

--------

Replacing, `!_blockSideEffects.invalidatesState` by `blockSideEffects.state != Effect::Write` should cause no problems. I think we would have to go back to having boolean parameters `movableIfStateInvariant`, `movableIfstorageInvariant`, `movableIfMemoryInvariant` inside `SideEffects`.

@chriseth When we add a new boolean field for 'infinite loops' and 'recursive functions', say, `bool deterministic`, I think we shouldn't assign `movable = false`  when encountering these looping behaviour (same for `sideEffectFree` and `sideEffectFreeIfNoMSize`.)

To prevent moving, we can change the functions `SideEffectsCollector::movable()` to return `m_sideEffects.deterministic &&  m_sideEffects.movable`. Similarly, for `sideEffectFree()` etc. Currently `SideEffects::movable` is never accessed directly, it's always accessed via `SideEffectsCollector`, so this change is relatively easy to make.

I still think https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9283#issuecomment-652953223 can be very confusing because we are using the same terms for different things. What is the advantage of not setting `movable` and `canBeRemoved` to false?

@chriseth we could set `movable` and `canBeRemoved` to false. But it is redundant since we could AND `cannotLoop` and `movable` anyway. There is even a comment, that talks about not assigning `movable` to `true.`

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2d64f53a39f4a32f3560e0e8cb2c5d0908fc278f/libyul/optimiser/Semantics.cpp#L98-L102

I agree that `SideEffectPropagator::movable()` returning `m_sideEffects.cannotLoop && m_sideEffects.movable` can be a bit confusing (instead of `m_sideEffects.movable`). Maybe we can rename `SideEffectPropagator::movable()` to `cannotLoopAndMovable()`. Similarly `cannoLoopAndCanBeRemoved()`?

I'm not sure if the comment is really correct (I know, I wrote it ;) ). Functions containing loops cannot be moved across control-flow branches and this is required by "movable". What we could do is check whether some use-cases that check for "movable" should actually check for something that would also be fine with functions containing for loops and then define a new property that is different from movable.

I think after this refactoring, the condition in ExpressionSimplifier::visit can be changed to be less strict.

Would be good to get another thorough review of this.
