I think it would be cleaner in terms of change review (especially judging test cases) if this change would be separated and first reviewing/merging the "disallow dot in user identifiers" change.

Ready for review.

I think this needs to be mentioned in 070-breaking-changes.rst https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/breaking/docs/070-breaking-changes.rst

Not sure about the member - we are not doing proper path resolving yet - what do you think @ekpyron ?

Added a check for `_slot` and `_offset`.

In the long run we should make it proper path resolution and properly resolve ``stackItems()`` in them. But if we don't do that here, talking about "suffices" until we change that, seems fine to me.

Another thing, though: while we're at breaking things here, do we want to go with the ``stackItems()`` idea in general moving forward? Then maybe we should change this for memory references as well and not resolve the name itself, but only ``arr.mpos``. Then switching to proper path resolution and actually using ``stackItems()`` as well as adding this for calldata references and all that would become non-breaking, right?

*With* the ``stackItems()`` idea we'd also get external function types for free. But it'd also break accessing contract addresses, i.e. it would be ``C c; assembly { let x := c.address }`` instead of ``let x := c``. But all of that seems reasonable to me...

Do you think we'd have the time to do all this properly for 0.7 :-)? Or at least go as far as to make doing it non-breaking (i.e. change memory references and contract references here)?

@ekpyron I actually think this would be more confusing that helpful, especially for types that only have one stack slot. Also it wolud expose the names of the slots while this was just an internal name for now. I think this is too much for 0.7.

Rebased and fixed test.
