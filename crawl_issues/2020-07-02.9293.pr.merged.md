# [\#9293 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9293) `merged`: [Yul] Restrict `linkersymbol` to object dialect and add missing changelog entries

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-07-02 12:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9293):

Part of #8078.

Without this the change would affect how `assembly` blocks work and would have to be considered a breaking change.

Changelog entries are for #9239 and #9240.
