# [\#9299 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9299) `closed`: Semantic tests for external functions with memory arguments.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8942 also allowed external functions to take memory arguments, but it didn't add semantics tests for it, so we should definitely add some to be sure it actually works.

Also the documentation needs some updates.

Connected to this: We actually now also allow calldata parameters in construcotrs :)
