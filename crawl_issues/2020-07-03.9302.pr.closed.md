Fixes #9301 

Draft because still working on a TODO mentioned in the issue.

Should also add more in `libsolidity/semanticTests/inlineAssembly`:
```
contract C {
  function f() public view returns (uint ret) {
    assembly {
      function g() -> a, b { a := 1 b := 2 }
      let x
      x, x := g()

      ret := x
    }
  }
}
```
and
```
contract C {
  function f() public view returns (uint x) {
    assembly {
      function g() -> a, b { a := 1 b := 2 }
      x, x := g()
    }
  }
}
```

Currently, viaYul tests are failing as expected (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9303#issue-650499601). Once https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9303 is implemented, the failing tests should be turned into a syntactic test instead that fails (because we decided to disallow it).

Looks like a PR that fixes #9303 is a better place to make these changes. Should I close this PR in that case?

Updated PR with one expectation for yul optimiser/interpreter (last assigned value) on the one hand and another expectation for legacy optimiser (first assigned value) on the other hand. Newly added tests should now pass.

Closing as the underlying issue cannot happen anymore.

So should the issue (#9301) also be closed?
