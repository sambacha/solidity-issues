We should compile some contracts via yul and perform gas checks.

There are some very limited gas tests, we should add some more, especially also comparing compiling via yul not!

To make the impact of renaming functions as small as possible, this should use `std::stable_sort` on a source-order vector of function definitions with a comparator that compares according to the call depth.
