Copy from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9323#discussion_r461110222:

@chriseth Introducing reserved keywords is tracked in #9330 and disallowing keywords is in #9329, because of that I think this PR should/could be merged as is.

Ok, but this PR is still a regression, isn't it?

Regression in what sense?

You are removing the code that disallows names like `jump` - or did I miss anything?

It changes nothing user facing. In the user-side we already have this problem allowing these identifiers in the first place -- this PR does not change that. In the optimiser it allows `jump`/`jumpi`/`dupN`/`swapN` used as identifiers.

I think we have to do #9330 separately which cleans up this matter. And if #9331 is merged then we can also easily reject using Yul tokens (but that results today in a compilation error anyway).

@chriseth need to be approved again, removed some more unneeded headers :)
