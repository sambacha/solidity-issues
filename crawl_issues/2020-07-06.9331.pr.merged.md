# [\#9331 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9331) `merged`: Introduce Token::isYulToken() and use it in AsmParser

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-07-06 22:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9331):

Fixes #7811.
Fixes #8488.

Inspired by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9329#discussion_r450384117

Depends on #9526.

The goal of this PR is to have a separate set of keywords for Yul and Solidity in their respective parsers. After this change the parsers should behave like described in their respective grammars.

It is also useful as a groundwork for #9327 (see #9329 as a PR).

Reworked this based on #9526.

There are weird errors.

I'm adding a large test case to `yulSyntaxTests` with every solidity keyword, as those should be valid in yul.

@chriseth @leonardoalt @ekpyron I think this is ready a for "final" review.

Should we maybe think about a set of reserved keywords in Yul? If we allow more now, then disallowing any again later will be breaking...

Good idea. Any suggestions? I'm not sure we need to reserve things like the memory types (`mptr`)?

I'm not sure there's need for any - I guess the types will be part of the dialect, resp. (compiler-predefined) "user-defined" types, so they don't need to be reserved keywords?
So maybe we don't need any, but if someone comes up with one, it may be good to put it in here :-).

Perhaps constants in yul (#5928) :wink:

The types would also have conversion functions, but I think we are too far away to consider that, e.g. it can wait a major bump.

And we could reserve some proposed names from #7966, but again, that can wait for the next major bump. Likewise some helpers, like require (#7317) could also qualify -- probably these two issues are the realm of dialect, which is handled in #9549.

Yeah, I was actually thinking about the constants - even though I still don't think there is actually any need for them :-D.

As a note: this passes the antlr tests, when rebased on top of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9606.

Since #9606 was merged, this is ready to be merged.

Ok, perhaps some new tests were merged, need to recheck.
