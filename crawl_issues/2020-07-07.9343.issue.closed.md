## Description
Investigate, fix and re-enable tests disabled in #9342.

[My analysis posted on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5f0489a9a9378637e8b2215b):
> Looks like it's just 5 tests that take 99% of execution time with `--run_test=Phaser`. And takes more like 70 seconds:

> It's weird that those tests in particular are so slow. There are many others that repeat stuff thousands of times to check distributions of random values and they still run below 1 second taken all together. At a glance I don't see anything that should be making them that slow. For example `runNextRound_should_do_addition` runs just one round with 1000 identical `"aaaaaaaaaa"` chromosomes with a dummy metric that does not even optimize any program (it just returns chromosome length). It should finish instantly.

> I don't see anything obvious in these tests or in the algorithm code so this will need some profiling. In the meantime, I think I'll just disable them and create an issue to investigate and re-enable them when I'm done with `solc-bin` nightly and release scripts. The code has tons of tests anyway so I don't think it's going to fall into disrepair without those 5 in the meantime :)

## Steps to Reproduce
This should finish instantly:
```bash
soltest --log_level=test_suite --run_test=Phaser
```
