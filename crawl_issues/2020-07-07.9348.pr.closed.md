Ok, maybe the optimizer **is** capable of coping with this then after all :-).

@ekpyron just tested the "avoid copy" for now.

Haha, really :-)? If we get the right way to do this here, it really can't be slower than before... can it :-)?

I also tried replacing some sets with vectors with no difference. Closing this.

Since ``YulString``s are basically "pre-hashed", just out of curiosity I replaced all ``std::map<YulString``s with ``std::unordered_map<YulString``s (defining ``std::hash<YulString>`` to use ``YulString::hash``)...
I actually got 2% speedup (22.868 vs 23.358 seconds for all viaYul tests) - but it also causes one tests in there and a few others outside ``viaYul`` to fail... not sure why those fail and not sure 2% are worth investigating that - although this may be a hidden bug somewhere, since I'm not sure anything should actually depend on the string order...

I don't think that 2% is a stable number across runs. The failing tests are interesting, though! Can we make them fail in the same way by just changing the hash algorithm?

You mean by changing ``YulString::operator<``? I can try...
The test failures are due to the ``unordered_map`` version obviously being wrong, though - so my guess is that it's just some weird, but harmless side-effect of unordered maps - but I'm not sure.
