# [\#9353 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9353) `closed`: Clean up the mess of basePath in solc
**Labels**: `takeover`

The goal of this PR is to make sure that with `solc/solc --base-path openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/ openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/SafeERC20.sol` the following imports will work:
- in `openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/SafeERC20.sol`: `import "./IERC20.sol";`
- in `openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/SafeERC20.sol`: `import "../../math/SafeMath.sol";`

Need to check if this could close #9346.

I am still of the opinion, that the commandline arguments to solc should be proper paths that the shell can resolve. Internally, it would be nice to strip the base path if the given file is inside that directory.

Just to state the problem, I expect the following to work:
```

```

The above output is on `develop`, not this PR. Do we agree the above should work or not?

(And adding some of those extra paths to `--allow-path` does not help.)

I agree that file completion is good, and would be nice to have it. Disregarding that, this messy PR in its current form makes this to work:
```shell
$ solc/solc --base-path openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/ token/ERC20/SafeERC20.sol

Draft or ready for review?

For some reason now this translate `solc test.sol` into trying to load `/test.sol`.

Described what this should do on the top. Feel free to take over.

I think essentially `solc --base-path BP BP/x` should behave like `cd BP; solc x` - the main question is what to do if an input file lies outside the base path.

I could take this over.

What do you think about first adding a table in the docs that would illustrate how various combinations of `--base-path`, `--allowed-paths` and absolute/relative paths (both in imports and in paths specified on the command-line) interact with each other? This would show in a clear way how corner cases are handled now and we could then easily decide which ones do not match our expectations and change them.

We could also extract the path remapping logic out of `CommandLineInterface` and use these examples as test cases. Maybe also unify the behavior with standard JSON (do these options have equivalents there?).

Sounds good, but I think a summary of what we want and changing it right away is better than just documenting the status quo.

Closing this for now. We'll first figure out it in #11036 and #11105, and then come back.
