# [\#9354 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9354) `merged`: Improve testing speed by only enabling the Yul optimizer if needed.

Previously, the yul optimizer was forcefully enabled during testing to prevent stack errors. This PR tries to compile without optimizer first (unless requested) and does a second re-run with optimizer if the first one failed.

Weird - it doesn't cut down testing speed too much. It went from 40 seconds to 9 seconds on the "viaYul" semantic tests for me.

This makes `soltest` go from 7 to 5 minutes on my machine.
