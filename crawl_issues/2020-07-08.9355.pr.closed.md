I think the original issue meant adding `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0` to all `.cpp` and `.h` files in solidity (maybe even more!) provided that that file has a `GPL-3.0` license already.

Currently, we have the following to indicate the license.

If we are adding the SPDX license identifier, we could even remove the license boilerplate. @axic Is that what you had in your mind?

@hrkrshnn  My bad. Sorry, I understood it wrongly.

@hrkrshnn @axic @chriseth  Please review it.

Unfortunately, the SPDX-identifier cannot be a replacement for the license header, so please do not remove it and just add the SPDX-line after it.

Hi @sacgrover , any updates here?

@leonardoalt I think, we can close this PR because I have modified all files as per last discussion but as per latest review by chriseth . It would be hard for me to visit all files manually and append text as per GPL or MIT licence.

@sacgrover It doesn't have to be done manually: the same way this here was done automatically to `replace GPL text by SPDX line`, it could automatically `replace GPL text by (GPL text and SPDX line)`. I'd say it doesn't need to include MIT for now because most of our C++ files are GPL anyway.

@leonardoalt  So In that case... That text has been already replaced with that line in this PR.  isn't this correct?

@sacgrover no, the SPDX line would be appended to the existing GPL text. I meant that one way to do that would be to do the same thing you did automatically, but instead of replacing "GPL text" by "SPDX line", you would replace "GPL text" by
"GPL text"
"SPDX line"
which would have the append effect in the end

@leonardoalt so It will be for CPP file only or other files as well ? I want to be more clear to avoid back and forth.

@sacgrover I guess for whichever files have the GPL header that is currently replaced in this PR. I'm aware of the `.h` and `.cpp` we have in the codebase with that header, but there might be others as well.
