This was discussed in the past and also briefly mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8880#issuecomment-626674881

The `ripemd160` builtin has been there since the beginning because, but 1) it never caught any real use; and 2) we do not expose every precompile in the language (for example ecadd/ecmul/ecpairing and blake2b are not exposed).

What about sha256?

`keccak256` is widely used today, and `sha256` is picking up because of its use in Eth2.0 and other protocols.

maybe group them in a common namespace?

I considered that we should move all/most of our builtins into new namespaces and have the contract explicitly import them, for example `sha256`, `keccak256`, `ecrecover` under `crypto`:
```
import keccak256 from crypto; // here crypto is an identifier because it is "built in"
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
