# [\#9360 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9360) `merged`: Improve error message when assigning builtin functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-07-08 17:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9360):

Closes #4551.
Closes #8875.

Could also output `bound function` and "close" #8875, but I could see a reason to properly support that issue instead.

Good apart from the single style comment.

Also added a case for bound functions, solves another "bug" issue.

Need to squash some commits prior to merging.

@chriseth @ekpyron any opinions?

Does this affect the AST output? If yes, we should put it in the changelog.

Also I'm wondering whether it would be better to always start with `function` and put stuff like `bound` and `builtin` at the end.

I think it is more natural in the front, both in English and it is similar to how we use the "abstract" keyword.

Apparently it does:
```
                            "type": "function (bytes memory) pure returns (bytes32)",
                            "value": "sha256"
```
vs
```
                            "type": "builtin sha256",
                            "value": "sha256"
```

Should we keep the old one there?

In english it does make sense, but for tools the parsing might be easier if the first thing they see is "function" - so maybe split it up even more?

So this change is okay as long for the AST as we document it?

Not sure about that, what would you propose? `function builtin`?

yeah `function builtin` looks good.

Also I noticed yesterday that `toString` / `canonicalName` is used to compute the function selector for library functions. I think we should check that this is unaffected and we should also add some tests if we don't have any.

After #9868, this can be made much nicer.

Oh, apparently this was waiting for some feedback the past month, just was never set from draft mode.

The question is which route to take:
a) display special function type
b) display extra message of different internal type
c) combination of both a) and b) (this is the current stage of the PR)

Tests need to be updated.

Rebased. Will read comments to see what version people want.

It is improving the error messages. So hardly breaking.

@christianparpart I think these are good points and we should improve it. I opted to remove the function type name change from this PR and made it the least amount of changes. We could look into it at a later time.
