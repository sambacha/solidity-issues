# [\#9361 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9361) `merged`: [BREAKING] Remove finney and szabo denominations.

Closes #9337.

We could have issued an error like "finney denomination is no longer supported" instead of completely removing - but since you said no-one uses this anyways, I'd say just removing and keeping the code clean is nicer - but I'll change it if you disagree.

Also includes the change of `gwei` to a proper keyword now as a second commit. I can extract it into its own PR, though, if wanted.

Do we actually want this? I was under the impression we want to allow `gwei` as an identifier and later maybe even the other unit denominations too

I don't think we *wanted* to allow that for `gwei`, but we wanted `gwei` to be non-breaking, so we had to :-). Until now.

EDIT: just to illustrate why we probably *don't* actually want this, if we don't *have* to, look at what happens as long as we do:
```
  uint gwei = 1;
  assert(gwei != 1 gwei);
  assert(1 * gwei != 1 gwei);
  assert(1 * gwei != 1 * 1 gwei);
```
etc. ...

I guess it needs `develop` -> `breaking`
