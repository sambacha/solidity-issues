It assumes that tags never have their upper bits set.

Yeah... I rather didn't immediately see how the mask value is restricted, mainly because in the commuted version ``(_pushTag.data() & u256(0xFFFFFFFF)) == u256(0xFFFFFFFF)`` it looks a bit weird :-). But in the unswapped version it makes more sense.
