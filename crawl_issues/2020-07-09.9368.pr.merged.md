Closes #9213. Replaces #9254.

`scripts/docker/buildpack-deps/README.md`

# buildpack-deps docker images

The `buildpack-deps` docker images are used to compile and test solidity within our CI.

## GitHub Workflow

The creation of the images are triggered by a single workflow, defined in `.github/workflows/buildpack-deps.yml`. For each resulting `buildpack-deps` docker image a strategy is defined in the workflow file - the image variant. The workflow gets triggered, if any Dockerfile defined in `scripts/docker/buildpack-deps/Dockerfile.*` were changed within the PR.

### Versioning

The version of the docker images can be defined within the Dockerfile with `LABEL version`. A new docker image will only be created and pushed, if the new version is incremented by `1` compared with the version of the Dockerfile located in `develop`.

### Build, Test & Push

Note that the whole workflow - including all defined strategies (image variants) - will be triggered, even if only a single Dockerfile was change. The full workflow will only gets executed, if the corresponding Dockerfile was changed. The execution of workflows of unchanged Dockerfiles will not continue and just return success.  See `scripts/ci/docker_upgrade.sh`. 

If the version check was successful, the docker image will be built using the Dockerfile located in `scripts/docker/buildpack-deps/Dockerfile.*`.

The resulting docker image will be tested by executing the corresponding `scripts/ci/buildpack-deps_test_*` scripts. These scripts are normally symlinked to `scripts/ci/build.sh`, except for the `buildpack-deps ubuntu1604.clang.ossfuzz` docker image, that is symlinked to `scripts/ci/build_ossfuzz.sh`. These scripts `scripts/ci/build.sh` and `scripts/ci/build_ossfuzz.sh` are also used by CircleCI, see `.circleci/config.yml`.

If the tests passed successfully, the docker image will get tagged by the version defined within the corresponding `Dockerfile`. Finally, a comment will be added to the PR that contains the full repository, version and repository digest of the freshly created docker image.

We should probably document the process at least in some README or in some other appropriate place by the way.
EDIT: maybe not in the actual documentation, though, but rather near the actual Dockerfile's, since it cannot be done by external contributors anyways, so documenting it would mainly be for future reference for us.

Once this is ok, I will increment the versions to create the first official docker images.

So just to be clear: the actions failing now is by design and intentional - they'll start working on the next PR that increments the version - and @aarlt has a fork in which that was already demonstrated do work (haven't you ;-))?

@ekpyron yes sure :) See: https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/pull/22 .. the failure shown there right now is there because I set the version back to version zero.. https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/pull/22/commits

I really think one workflow per image with a proper trigger is nicer than unifying them with the strategy matrix and will avoid a lot of confusion down the road, so I think that's worth the duplication and I'd suggest to change that back.
Intentionally provoking failed runs on PRs doesn't seem like a good idea to me.

We could also have the update script in the action only run, if the corresponding docker file has *any* changes, but that will result in *succeeding* action runs on the PR for unchanged docker images - that's equally confusing. I expect github actions will - at some point in the future - provide some nicer means to avoid duplication like that (I saw some issue in that direction), but for now I would just keep it at separate actions.

There's trailing whitespace in the README though, bothering the style check script ;-).

I did some final tests in https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/pull/29 and https://github.com/aarlt/solidity/pull/30 and it looks quite good. Should we first merge this and then increment the version to build the first images?
