# [\#9372 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9372) `merged`: Cover cmdlineTests.sh errors

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-07-09 12:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9372):

I had an idea to add detection of error codes produced by **cmdlineTests.sh** to the **error_codes.py** script.

However it seems that (at least for now) it would bring very limited value, just 4 additional error codes.

Two of them are added to **syntaxTests**, and for two others ("SPDX" and "no compiler version specified") a special check is implemented.
