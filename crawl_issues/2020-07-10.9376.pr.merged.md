# [\#9376 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9376) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Refactor verification targets

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-07-10 08:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9376):

Split off https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9113 since it has been problematic and we need the code here so https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9352 can move on.

Simple refactoring of how the verification targets are run in CHC, no tests affected.
