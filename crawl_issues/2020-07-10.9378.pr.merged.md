This optimizes for a very special case, but
1. I think this special case might not actually be that rare.
2. I think it's the only way to make https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9162#discussion_r452344015 work out nicely.
3. Any stack slot saved is a win :-).

I'd *like* for this to be extended beyond variables in the same scope, but that's a nightmare with loops and function arguments, etc. - so if at all I'd do it separately. Having it for the same scope should be mostly sufficient (we flatten blocks anyways).

Yeah, I was and am thinking about more tests... but this runs against each and every semantic test already ;-). But I can try to come up with one or two to add to the unit tests directly...

Yea maybe just add one for each negative case

I replaced this by @chriseth's suggestion, which seems to work out and is both simpler and more general :-).
