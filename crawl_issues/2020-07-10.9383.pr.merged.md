# [\#9383 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9383) `merged`: Upgrade json-cpp to 1.9.3.

The release notes read generally favorable: https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/releases

And json-cpp 1.9.2 is slower to build and causing issues with clang-10 and the ossfuzz builds, stalling the docker image work of @aarlt.

There shouldn't be any harm in doing this and I double checked that there's no mention of 1.9.2 left in the repo, so I think I'll go ahead merging this, once CI finishes, so that @aarlt can better proceed.
