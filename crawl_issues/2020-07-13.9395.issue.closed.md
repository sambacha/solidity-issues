## Abstract

Post https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9082, signed conversion errors inside *all* source files within fuzzer targets get ignored. This issue tracks support for disabling signed conversion checks for only those files that are auto-generated by protobuf.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
