Can you add a fullSuite test for something like
```
function f(a) -> x {
  a := calldataload(0)
  mstore(a, x)
}
```
This should be optimized to
```
function f() {
  mstore(calldataload(0), 0)
}
```
Maybe we could even use `a` in a loop (where it cannot be replaced by an SSA variable) but write to `a` before it is read from. 

It might be that the optimizer will have a problem with the loop case, but at least regular write before read should be optimized.
