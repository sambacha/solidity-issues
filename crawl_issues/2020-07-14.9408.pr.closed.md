# [\#9408 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9408) `closed`: Refactor subtype size check.

@a3d4 I remember you asking where the check should be and I said "as early as possible". I thought this was about preventing an internal error but this does not seem the case and thus I think the static analyzer is better suited since the type checker should mainly validate that operators can properly applied to types and it is already doing a lot of other checks.

Fixes #9099 for me, should also include that example?

Does this closes #9129 then?

This is a refactor - #9099 should already be fixed in develop if this fixes it.

To me warning about types of things being dangerous still seems like a thing for the type-checker - but nothing against moving it back :-).

type checker is about things being impossible - things being dangerous should be done in the static analyzer :)

Tried develop and it is fixed, not sure which PR did.

Maybe we should create an issue for moving all the other stuff over then :-)?

@chriseth @ekpyron 
My understanding was that we wanted to unify (in some sense) `ReferenceType::validForLocation`, `StorageOffsets::computeOffsets` and `oversizedSubtypes`. (`oversizedSubtypes` as a free function could disappear in my planned next refactoring.)

Very roughly speaking, if an object size exceeding 2^256 is an error, but exceeding 2^64 is just a warning, both checks might belong together. Placing the checks for "the elephant does not fit the china shop" and "the elephant might scratch walls" close to each other does not look that wrong conceptually (and should lead to shorter code, pragmatically).

I understand the difference between "impossible things" and "dangerous things", but not sure if it justifies using completely different checkers.

Are you sure we want to move the code back to `StaticAnalyzer`?

The technical side of PR looks good. I have a bit mixed feelings about "variable covers" vs "type covers", as "variable covers" sounds better. But at the same time it is a relief if a simple unified message is used :).

I'd tend towards @a3d4's position here.
But I'd also be fine with moving - but then we should clearly define this distinction as a policy and move all other warnings out of the ``TypeChecker`` as well and make this consistent.

The other check was moved into the ContractLevelChecker because it checks a property of the contract. I would prefer to keep the typechecker as small in scope as possible and let it only perform local checks like "what is the return type of this function" or "can you apply this operator to these types".

Maybe we can move both checks to the static analyzer or introduce a whole new component (in preparation to move more checks out of the type checker)?

And I agree that the size checks in 'validforlocation' should be done somewhere else - `validforlocation` should only check if there are any types that are conceptually impossible for the location like mappings in memory or recursive structs in calldata.

Just as a note: at the moment the **only** thing ``validForLocation`` does, is size checks :-).
I only introduced it a while back as a generalization of ``validForCalldata``, which also only ever checked size bounds...
I'm not saying that this is all nice as it is now, but we should probably carefully think about what stuff to move where in general...

This could for example mean to remove ``validForLocation`` altogether and replace it by a general ``sizeUpperBoundForLocation`` that doesn't validate anything, but merely calculates the size bounds for each location.
Then we could just use that to validate that the sizes are fine in ``StaticAnalyzer`` or a new component.

We have to be careful not to do things like this too late, though - having unreasonable types like e.g. types with too large size was the source of quite a few ICEs - but it's probably fine as long as we catch all of it before codegen (and by now we should have a lot of tests that would hopefully show any issues that might occur earlier than that).

Ah wow, I did not know that, I thought it would at least check for things like mappings or so!

Then we should certainly rename that function and check if it needs to be in the type checker.

I could imagine changing the storage offset calculations to use bigints to avoid assertion failures.

Having `Type::sizeUpperBoundForLocation` as just a size calculator looks as a right thing to me (regardless of where it is called to check for impossible and dangerous types). Should it be the next step?

That sounds like a good plan, @a3d4 ! But please move this out of the type checker if possible.
