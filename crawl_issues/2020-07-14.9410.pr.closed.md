I do have windows build and test runs written for github actions here: https://github.com/ekpyron/solidity/blob/5a9345798e396e79d18faed61ed1de5c094557ef/.github/workflows/emscripten.yml

Might be helpful for having powershell download evmone and stuff like that.
EDIT: Haha, although I just realized that I never got around to actually finish and fix that last part of having it run against evmone, so if anything, it's only a rough reference :-).
