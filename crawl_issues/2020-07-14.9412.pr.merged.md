Wouldn't just adding a check for `c` being "printable" and at most 127 in the following line solve the whole problem (plus adding a "scanUnicodeString" similar to "scanHexString"): https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/liblangutil/Scanner.cpp#L792 ?

(if the check fails, the scanner would return "invalid token" or something)

I think scanner errors are the worst from the point of the user understanding what is going on.

That is the place however I added the check for transmitting the different token type.

needs expectation update in the ast tests.

These clang warnings are extremely annoying, they don't happen locally on my clang... and it takes forever for CI to run.

There are also failures in soltest: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/7028/workflows/d11cf686-97b2-4a77-a346-4d51dc044707/jobs/402484

Yes, I'm fixing that. Strangely it did not occur locally, but perhaps I did not ran every single test (as it still takes ~20 minutes here).
