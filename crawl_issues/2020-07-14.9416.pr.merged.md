I think this is totally a bugfix we want to have. It is interesting that we already have several tests that now add the new error! The problem is that in order to fix these tests, we make the base contract functions `view` instead of `pure`, but then we get many warnings: state mutability can be restricted to `view`.

Should we not issue this warning for a `virtual` function?

Added a second commit: Functions reading constant state variables are considered `pure` - so I think constant public state variables should also be pure.

Yeah, not issuing the warning for ``virtual`` functions makes sense. We already don't issue it for functions with empty implementation - basically because we didn't *have* ``virtual`` at the time - we could think about removing that special case and instead not warn for anything ``virtual``. (A non-virtual function with empty implementation makes little sense anyways, doesn't it?)

Tests are failing though?
