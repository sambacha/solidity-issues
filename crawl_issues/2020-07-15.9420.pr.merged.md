This PR confirms that https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9430 worked and uses the images built there for our CI runs.

The hashes are the ones the github actions left as comments in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9430

By the way: in the future the plan would be to have the action that ran in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9430 auto-create this PR, so that we don't have to manually transfer the hashes from there to here and to make sure that we don't miss the travis config or the build_emscripten script (which e.g. happened in 0.6.11).
