Run on "large" resulted in the following test times (minutes): 5.5, 4, 4, 1

Will try the default instance and see if it is significantly slower.

Regular needs: 6, 4, 4, 1

So I would stay with regular and maybe increase parallelization instead.

Needs rebase.

If we end up with a test setup that just gets passed a list of test names to run, then circleci could even auto-balance the jobs by measuring which take more time, that would be really nice...

On the other hand, i don't know the system would take a list of 50k test names...

Hm... maybe test suites would be a start?

github, what is wrong with you? I force-pushed a minute ago!

I did notice it kind of sucking in that regard recently - also with comments - those took hours for me to trigger notifications or even show up on the website on several occasions...
