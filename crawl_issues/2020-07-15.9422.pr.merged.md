> I don't think this is the right way to do it, we should properly fix `commonType` to return a function type that does not have named parameters. Maybe it would be enough to remove the names in `mobileType()`.

I am not sure how to do this, but will check. I agree that we should fix it properly.

Yes, problem should exist there as well

I changed mobile type to have empty names instead of named arguments from left function type.
This produces error that says that named argument is not matching function declaration. Hope this is fine.

Also, before it was possible to do things like:
```
contract C {
    function g(int x, int y) public pure returns (int) { return x - y; }
    function h(int y1, int x1) public pure returns (int) { return y1 - x1; }

    function f() public pure {
        (false ? g : h)({x : 1, y : 2});
    }
}
```

It was taking names from left type, and completely ignoring names from right.

No test failures looks good!

We did not have tests for calling function types with named parameters - but that did not work in the first place. I'll add such a test.

I also removed the names of the return parameters. Now I think it is really compatible with 'isImplicitlyConvertibleTo'.

Could you please add some more tests by looking at `isImplicitlyConvertibleTo`? I'm thinking of things like `(true ? f{value: 10}, g{value: 10})()`

I will do it. Will also fix stackenbotten issues.

After adding some tests, discovered some other problems.

For example, in:
```
contract C {
    function f() external payable returns (uint) { return msg.value; }
    function g() external payable returns (uint) { return msg.value + 1; }

    function h() public returns (uint) {
        assert((true ? this.f{value: 1} : this.g{value: 1})() == 1);     // fails without assertion, just fails
        assert((false ? this.f{value: 1} : this.g{value: 1})() == 2);    // same
        assert([this.f, this.g][0]{value: 1}() == 1);                            // all fine
        assert([this.f, this.g][1]{value: 1}() == 2);                            // all fine
        return 13;
    }
}
// ----
// h() -> 13
```

So, when we set value with type it is ignored I think. Compilation is fine, but fails in runtime. I can investigate as part of this PR.
Compilation passes also if values passed are different for left and right type.

There is something really weird going on with setting function values in all of the cases actually. I need to dig more to find out

It might be that functions with value set need one additional stack slot.
