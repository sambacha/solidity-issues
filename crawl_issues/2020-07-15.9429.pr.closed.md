I think the `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` secret was not set yet.

@chriseth @ekpyron @cameel I'm not sure whether we can really use this solution. I think everyone will then be able to overwrite our docker images. 

Ah, it seem to depend on what properties are set for that secret, right?

Ah probably thats the problem here and my user can not read the secret because of permissions?

As long as we use sha256 digests to refer to the images, permissions don't really matter.

Can you try pushing a branch in the repo instead? I don't think secret tokens will be available from PRs from forks (that'd be literally anyone having access to it).

Closing in favour of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9430 (which is exactly the same just from a branch in our repo, not from a fork, which makes it work)

Nice! So that was also a good test :)
