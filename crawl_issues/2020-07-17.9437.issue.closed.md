# [\#9437 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9437) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Eventually bring back tests that were disabled

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9426 (and other PRs) we have disabled/removed some SMTChecker tests because of z3's nondeterminism. Even though they are working on fixing some of these problems, we won't see a new release very quickly. So we disabled those tests on our side so that CI can agree with local dev, but we should check those tests when there is a new z3 release.
