# [\#9438 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9438) `merged`: Set type properly for event definition subexpressions

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9434

Not sure if this is the correct fix. I haven't found any problems with further visiting the subexpressions of an event definition, but maybe there was a reason for that. @chriseth @axic ?

I don't understand - why do you need to continue visiting the event? The parameters are types and they are fully known after the analysis phase.

The types of the typenames yes, but not of all subexpressions.

Ah sorry, this is the analysis visitor not the smt visitor! Then it's fine!
