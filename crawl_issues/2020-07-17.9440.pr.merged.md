@leonardoalt Could you please rerun the fail one. Seems like failed without reason.

@sacgrover looking at all 569 files manually and visually string-check iff the license values match is really challenging. How did you create the diff? Did you use a small helper script (with a technique described in the prior PR) or did you touch them all manually?

@christianparpart Obviously, not manually :) I used VS Code my favorite editor to find the string and replace it with (search string + extra licence line). A mentioned in last PR, I changed only GPL licensed files.
