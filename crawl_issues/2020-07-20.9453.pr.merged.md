# [\#9453 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9453) `merged`: Replace acute accent with grave accent

The single acute accent, besides appearing in our code base only once, was also UTF-8 encoded, causing potential misprinting:

**Side remark 1**
There seems to be just one other case where the source file contains a UTF-8 character (test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp). We may want to fix it and create a new validation rule to enforce ASCII.

**Side remark 2**
The quotation marks in messages are different. We use ` " `, ` ' `, `` ` ``. Or sometimes nothing.
The message above is using both ` " ` (`"var"`) and `` ` `` (`` `uint8 x ....`). Do we have any guidelines?

`var` is removed (converted to a parser error) in breaking (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9428.) So, there are no more checks for var in `TypeChecker`.
