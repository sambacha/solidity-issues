**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Description

Currently, we time out of recursive call interpretation by counting the number of basic blocks interpreted and timing out once this number has breached a pre-defined threshold.

For example

```
{
  function f() -> x { x := f(); }
  mstore(0, f())
}
```

However, because the pre-defined threshold for optimised code is greater than (currently 4x times) that for unoptimised code, it is possible in certain corner cases that the interpretation of optimised code runs out of stack memory (due to recursion) when the fuzzing process has access to only a limited amount of stack memory.

This issue tracks support for fixing this by counting the number of interpreted statements (instead of the number of interpreted basic blocks). Infinite for loops are prevented by counting each for loop execution as a single step.
