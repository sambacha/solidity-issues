## Description

Using `block.timestamp` causes `YulException: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable value5 is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.\n\u001b[31mCompilation failed. See above.\u001b[39m`

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.11
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): petersburg
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Confirmed in both `etherlime` and `truffle`
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: `ganache-cli`
- Operating system: OSX

## Steps to Reproduce
I am still trying to isolate it but the branch where that surfaced is https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts/tree/maintenance/migrate-to-blockchain-timestamp I've minified the changes to just a single switch from `now` to `block.timestamp` [here](https://github.com/argentlabs/argent-contracts/pull/139/files#diff-252645bba53001a15e101c0e5845da2eR128) which causes the failure, see CI run https://circleci.com/gh/argentlabs/argent-contracts/1253 step `Compiling contracts`. You can reproduce on the above branch by running `npm run cc`.

Note that compiling the contracts one by one does work, it's only when targeting a directory when this errors.

Making the same change in the legacy contracts compiled with solc 0.5.4 does **not** manifest the error, this error only happens in 0.6. (tested with 0.6.11 only).

Upgrading to solc 0.6.12 appears to have [solved that](https://circleci.com/gh/argentlabs/argent-contracts/1261) so perhaps it's a symptom of a bug fixed there.
