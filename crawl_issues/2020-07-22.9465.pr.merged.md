# [\#9465 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9465) `merged`: Checked arithmetic by default.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-07-22 08:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9465):

Depends on #9479.

TODO:
 - [x] documentation
 - [x] document: division by zero is always checked
 - [x] wrapping arithmetics for Sol -> Yul
 - [x] disallow `-x` for unsigned `x` outside of "unchecked" - or do we want to disallow it in general? `0-x` is still OK, I would say.
 - [ ] decide which error to report and change all errors.

Rebase problems?

This still needs to be rebased and perhaps need to merge develop into breaking too. At the same time this seems to depend on #9479, so I'd suggest turning this to draft until that is merged.

Rebased and changed target to `breaking_8` (@axic requested to have one breaking branch per release at some point)

Can you add a test where a new block is defined inside an `unchecked ` block such as this:

```solidity
contract C {
   function f() public {
        unchecked{{
            uint max = type(uint).max;
            uint x = max + 1;
        }}
  }
}
```

`if (<sth>) unchecked { x; }` is invalid currently. It was just looking weird to me. We anyway need a special case unless we also want
`function f() public unchecked { x; }` to be valid.

It's fine, I was just wondering when I saw the grammar - disallowing it now is definitely good - we can still allow it later anyways, while not the other way!

Actually some commits need to be squashed.

Looks good. What about ` decide which error to report and change all errors.`?

Will be done in #10013
