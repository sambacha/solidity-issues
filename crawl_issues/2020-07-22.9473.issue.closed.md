**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

As preparation for the upcoming Solidity Portal we decided to use the documentation as the "main source of truth". Right now, there is no part in the docs indicating where and how one can contribute to the lang design discussion / process. 

We could either add a few sentences on that in the [contributing section](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.11/contributing.html) or create a new section. My opinion is adding it to contributing should suffice.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9175 for context on portal.
