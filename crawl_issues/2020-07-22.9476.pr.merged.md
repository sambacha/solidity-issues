# [\#9476 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9476) `merged`: Building release on Windows

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2020-07-22 14:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9476):

### Getting Windows tests running on CI

- Moves C++ version setting from toolchain into command line (such as `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_VERSION=20` (defaulting to 17); as this did conflict with AppVeyor CI always passing its own toolchain file (to vcpkg)
- Uses VS 2019 instead of VS 2017

@christianparpart In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9587#discussion_r466402829 I decided to leave the links unchanged. Please update them in this PR, either to VS2019 (if you manage to build with it) or to some working VS2017 links (otherwise).

We should check that release builds are built in release mode.

FÃ¼r eine reason soltest.exe isn't being created on CI. 

EDIT: Fixed. This was caused by a compile failure but the compile step in the CI did not notice that (marked as succeeded). I think this is not a big problem (if you know it) because the tests cant be run if compilation failed.

Can you extract the unrelated commits into their on PRs?

Build takes 24 minutes :(

We have 4 CPUs on the machine, maybe set parllelism to 5?

I was able to execute the appveyor builds using wine, but this build fails:
```
> wine ./solc.exe --version
000d:err:menubuilder:init_xdg error looking up the desktop directory
0009:err:module:import_dll Library VCRUNTIME140_1.dll (which is needed by L"Z:\\tmp\\solc.exe") not found
0009:err:module:attach_dlls Importing dlls for L"Z:\\tmp\\solc.exe" failed, status c0000135
```

Is it a problem with my system or the way it is built?

Hm, I have a file called `vcruntime140.dll` on my system.

Now I realize what @ekpyron recently must have meant with the windows release is broken. In my PR I was just 1:1 porting the BAT file to Powershell, so it must have been broken before too. I've now fixed and tested the resulting binary (using wine, too). and it works now. :)

Did you see or try #9594?

Now I did see. Thanks. Maybe CPack from cmake could do that for us. I would have to try that out. But maybe in another PR as this is not related to moving from appveyor to CircleCI? I can give that a try.

The idea was to quickly check if the static linking works using the linked cmake property - and if not to use cmake install targets for the dlls (the issue links to a PR in a fork demonstrating how that can be done)...

Or put differently: just trying to fetch some random dlls from some Visual Studio path was what broke this in the first place - we should either avoid those dlls or have cmake decide which ones to install instead.

Now the build and test jobs work, but is still using the `MSVC140_1.dll`

My current guess is that this is due to installing boost compiled with VS 2017.

Looks like the release build is not a release build.

Finally working!
