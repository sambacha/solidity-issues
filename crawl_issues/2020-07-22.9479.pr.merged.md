Would be nice to know the gas costs of this.

The inner loop itself takes about 144 gas per iteration. For an exp that uses the full 8 iterations this is about 1200 gas per exp operation.

In comparison, the opcode itself costs 10 gas.

If the LHS of the operation is a Literal, can we write a version where the compiler computes  the max-value of the exponent: `256/log_2(integer_literal)` The code reverts during runtime if the exponent is greater than or equal to this value. Otherwise, we make a call to `exp` (or `shl` if base is 2)

I tried to look at all the non-trivial examples (i.e., not `literal**literal`) of exponentiation. All such cases had a literal as a base, mostly 2, some 10, one 256. Here is a list of use cases https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/c73874b150d4a2c1ec6ebbc345efa9b3

@hrkrshnn @leonardoalt you are right, we should certainly specialize this for literals. it might even make sense to add some conditional to check for the values of non-literals.

After the "optimization for small bases" commit, most of the tests will now not test the loop anymore...

@leonardoalt can we prove this code correct?

All of the examples in @hrkrshnn 's list, the bases were either 2, 10 or 256, so I added optimized version for those bases.

> @leonardoalt can we prove this code correct?

with a few adjustments I think so

I just realized that functions containing `leave` cannot be inlined, which is of course fatal in case the exp function is used together with constants. That is another point in favour of replacing functions with constant arguments by copies. I will rewrite this without leave.

Why do we need checked exponentiation for the yul IR, but not for the old codegen?

This function is tricky. We do not necessarily want it to be inlined, but we want information about the size of the base to be taken into account in the function. Currently, the optimizer can only do this through inlining. Using `leave` prevents it from being inlined because the concept cannot be adequately replaced in all cases.

In the end of course, we should write the code such that it is best readable and improve the optimizer instead, because Solidity code will also very likely use `return`.

If a function does not contain a `leave` inside a loop, we can pack it into `for {} 1{} { ... break }` and replace the `leave` by a `break`, but I am not sure how well the other parts of the optimizer will cope with that.

Reverted to the version that uses `leave`. Since most of the code is the same regardless of the type, we might consider extracting the part that does not depend on the type into its own function (which then takes `max` as an explicit parameter), which would reduce code duplication

I'm now confident this is a version that can be merged, so please review!

The version that optimizes constants and small values will be done in another PR.
