# [\#9483 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9483) `closed`: Yul interpreter: Smaller execution timeout for tests and additional test cases

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7943 (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7943#issuecomment-662019812)

Also do not match traces in the fuzzer if optimized code runs out of execution steps because there is no guarantee that the traces are going to be the same.

I thought this was ready for a review but on a second thought, it is not. Will close this for now and reopen when it is.
