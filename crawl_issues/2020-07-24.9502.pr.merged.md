# [\#9502 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9502) `merged`: Add syntax tests for Yul objects

I did this before realising `ObjectParser.cpp` contains very similar test cases, but having them in this format I think is nicer. We should probably remove the duplicated cases from `ObjectParser.cpp` if we merge this.

Why not use the object parser for regular yul syntax tests instead?

It falls back to "code only" mode if the text does not start with `object`.

> Why not use the object parser for regular yul syntax tests instead?

That was my first choice (added all these checks into `yulSyntaxTests`), but that posed some issues. I can't fully remember what but it seemed reasonable to be separate.

It may do that but the object mode is just not working properly:
```
yulSyntaxTests/objects/multiple_root_object.yul: FAIL
  Contract:
    object "A" {
      code { }
    }
    object "B" {
      code { }
    }

  Expected result:
    ParserError 2314: (26-32): Expected end of source but got identifier
  Obtained result:
    ParserError 2314: (0-6): Expected '{' but got identifier
```

```
yulSyntaxTests/objects/conflict_object_object.yul: FAIL
  Contract:
    object "A" {
      code {}
    
      object "B" {
        code {}
      }
      object "B" {
        code {}
      }
    }

  Expected result:
    ParserError 8794: (66-69): Object name "B" already exists inside the containing object.
  Obtained result:
    ParserError 2314: (0-6): Expected '{' but got identifier
```

etc

@chriseth I think you mean the `yulOptimiserTests` which supports both?

Fixed `libyul/SyntaxTests` to parse objects too, better this way?

More tests can be moved and things can be dropped from `test/libyul/ObjectParser.cpp`, but would like to get some confirmation first that this direction is approved.

@chriseth what do you think?
