Can you try xcode 11?

Xcode 11 works but it requires macOS 10.14 or later

Sorry about that, it looks like macOS 10.13 does not support C++17. Can you at least work with the binaries?

@jjhesk The errors you posted right now look like harmless warnings so you could just tell the compiler to ignore them. The project is configured to treat all warnings as errors by default because we don't want them to be ignored in development but you can do just that for your personal build by removing the `add_compile_options(-Werror)` line from `cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake`. You can do it by editing the file or just run the one-liner below (run it from the main directory where you have the code checked out):

```bash
sed -i.bak '/^[[:blank:]]*add_compile_options(-Werror)[[:blank:]]*$/d' cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake
```

> where can i download the working binary to the system?

You can get static MacOS binaries from https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/macosx-amd64

Also, I'm almost finished with building older versions down to 0.4.0 so if you're interested in those, keep an eye on #9226. I post an update there when they're available.
