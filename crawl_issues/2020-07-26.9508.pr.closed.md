@axic I don't know anymore what encoding is correct for `address` and `balance`. Right now it is different from the `ewasm-interpreter` branch.
e.g. `test/libyul/ewasmTranslationTests/address.yul` storage dump
is not `0000000000000000000000000000000011111111000000000000000000000000` , but `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011111111 `. 
for `test/libyul/ewasmTranslationTests/balance.yul` storage dump
is not `0000000000000000000000000000000022222222000000000000000000000000`, but `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000022222222`
Right now I'm too blind to see the problem.

The point of this PR is to fix the translation and of course the output will change, because the evm->wasm translator now uses proper byteorder. I think the PR looks good.

@aarlt can you squash some of these commits? What is left to be done here?

Rebased in order to get the changes from #10135.

We may want to clarify what memory model we are following with the EVM->Wasm translator. I assume we are trying to keep the memory matching with EVM aka. numbers stored are in big-endian order.

This means we need to byteswap balances, but can just copy addresses and storage, as those are not treated as numbers in ewasm host functions.

@axic @aarlt do we need to discuss that in the round or are you confident that's the way to proceed?

inline assembly should "just work". `mload(x)` and `mload(add(x, 1))` should return the same thing on ewasm and on evm.

Agreed.

I think in this case this PR may need quite a bit of work to only swap the correct things. It may be swapping sload/store right now which masks the problem.

I added a test `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/various/endianess.sol` to check the behaviour of `mload`/`mstore` and `sload`/`sstore`. For `mload`/`mstore` ewasm is behaving exactly as in the EVM case. For `sload`/`sstore` I checked the "endianess" by adding debug output in evmone and hera. It turns out that the implementation is correct.

I think what needs to be done is documenting how this is supposed to operate above the polyfill:
- memory layout
- size and endianness of types (address, balance, storage)
- etc.

@aarlt can we close this?
