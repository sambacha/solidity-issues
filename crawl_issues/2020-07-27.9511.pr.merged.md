# [\#9511 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9511) `merged`: [BREAKING] Distinguish between stringLiteral and hexStringLiteral in the JSON AST

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-07-27 08:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9511):

Part of #9412.

The JSON AST prior to this change can not be used to completely represent the source, because the string literal kind is lost. The node also contains two values: `value` which is filled out if it is representable in JSON (and if it is, it may contain unicode escapes), and `hexValue` which is also a hex string.

This has not been a huge issue, because both string literals support unrestricted values. After #9412 this will not be possible (as the regular string literal wont accept a lot of characters), but I still felt it makes sense to do this as a separate PR. Let me know if it should be just folded into the soon-to-be-monster #9412.

I also thought about changing that behaviour of `value` using unicode escapes and things, but realised that we have to keep it in such a way because we are restricted by what is valid in JSON.
