Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9234
Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9506

I'm not sure this fix is the best, but anyway, here's what it does:
Solidity arrays are represented in the SMT encoding as a tuple (Array Int) where the first element is the array and the second the length. This tuples needs a name because this name is used by the SMT solver to create a constructor and accessor functions for this tuple type. Solidity does implicit conversion also for arrays where the base type is implicitly convertible, so that
```
    uint8[] a;
    uint[] b;
    function f() public {
        b = a;
    }
```
is allowed. The SMT solver complains then, because `uint8[] != uint[]`.
The solution here is to ignore the size of the base type when it has a size.

There is a test failure.
