# [\#9522 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9522) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix ICE in tuples again

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-07-27 15:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9522):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9519

No Changelog because same entry from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9515

This needs to be called here again instead of unwrapping the tuple before the whole thing because we need the `_funCall` expression as well, and that contains the tuple.
