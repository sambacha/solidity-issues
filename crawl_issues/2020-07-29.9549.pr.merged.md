Actually this PR opens up the possibility to simplify `AsmParser` even further. There is no need to mark things as `FunctionCall` if it is for a builtin in the parser, it can be decided later on in analysis (it is shadowing).

I suggest to do that in a separate PR, this is already quite big.

It looks good, however decision on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9549#discussion_r462495913 is needed.
Also, maybe removing duplicated tests is a good idea.

I'll rebase this on breaking, but I think it would make sense getting #9555 merged first, and merging develop into breaking, to reduce the potential for conflicts.
