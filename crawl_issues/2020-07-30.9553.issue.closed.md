```
/// @notice Hello Interface
interface A {
}

contract C is A {
}
```

results in

```
======= a.sol:A =======
User Documentation
{
  "kind": "user",
  "methods": {},
  "notice": "Hello Interface",
  "version": 1
}

======= a.sol:C =======
User Documentation
{
  "kind": "user",
  "methods": {},
  "version": 1
}
```

Same happens if `A` is a contract.

@Marenz I'm not sure what we've agreed to.

Is `@notice` on contracts meaningful at all? Also, should natspec on contracts (as opposed to functions) be auto-inherited?

`@notice` as it is currently implemented is only inherited on functions. The ticket didn't mention the contract case

I'm torn about whether `@notice` should be valid on contracts, but we can at least inherit the properties.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
