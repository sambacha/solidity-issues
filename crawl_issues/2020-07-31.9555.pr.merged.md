Depends on #9331.
Depends on #10203.

This shows the potential result -- a very simplified parser -- we can get to after the two dependencies.

Ok, I had no time to deal with the boost tests. I can update them once we agree on these changes / the direction.

Can

`using ElementaryOperation = std::variant<Literal, Identifier, FunctionCall>;`

be simplified to

`using ElementaryOperation = std::variant<Literal, Identifier>;`

?

Or actually I think it can be simplified to that in some places and replaced by `Expression` in others.

Looks very nice in general!

This is blocked on updating the boost tests. My goal was to have another PR which migrates them to syntax tests which can be easily updated.

I'll try to convert the boost tests.

Is this depending on anything else now?

`inlineAssemblyTests` need to be also extracted.

I am working on extracting more Yul tests (as discussed in Todays meeting).

How do I read the bytecodecompare output?

Probably better to not look at the diff but rather compare the results of the previous steps manually.

It looks like this PR is almost there, and it would be nice to have it.
@axic maybe someone could help you with the bytecode compare stuff?

Bytecode compare seems to be failing simply because of a version mismatch in metadata:
`0.7.5-develop.2020.11.9+commit.5bc51dcf` vs
 `0.7.5-develop.2020.11.10+commit.5bc51dcf`.

I think the issue is just that it ran around midnight and builds ended up with different dates. I reran the jobs and I think they'll succeed now.

Looks like it needs a rebase because of the spellcheck.

Oh, this should have been squashed prior to merging ðŸ˜¬
