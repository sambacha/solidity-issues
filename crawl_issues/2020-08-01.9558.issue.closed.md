# [\#9558 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9558) `closed`: [yul] ExpressionSimplifier removes non-movable expression
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

This test passes but it shouldn't because `call()` may change blockchain state (similarly other opcodes that are potentially state changing) and therefore if a contract previously disabled optimizer but at a later point *only* enabled the expression simplifier (not sure if this is a user-facing setting), the end-result will be different.

Please note that full optimization suite retains the `call` in the example below, so this is only a bug if one were to only enable the expression simplifier.

```
{
  pop(byte(0, shr(0x8, call(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))))
}
// ----
// step: expressionSimplifier
//
// { pop(0) }
```
