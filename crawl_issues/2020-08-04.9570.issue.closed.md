It would be nice if Solidity constants were supported in Yul.

Currently I have to do this:

```Solidity
    bytes32 internal constant ERC20TOKEN_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256("governance.token.diamond.ERC20Token");

    function erc20TokenStorage() internal pure returns(ERC20TokenStorage storage ds) {
        bytes32 position = ERC20TOKEN_STORAGE_POSITION;
        assembly { ds.slot := position }
    }
```

It would be nice if it worked this way:

```Solidity
    bytes32 internal constant ERC20TOKEN_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256("governance.token.diamond.ERC20Token");

    function erc20TokenStorage() internal pure returns(ERC20TokenStorage storage ds) {
        assembly { ds.slot := ERC20TOKEN_STORAGE_POSITION }
    }
```

In general there *is* support for accessing solidity constants from yul just like you want - but unfortunately only as long as they are actually compile-time constant, i.e. with ``bytes32 internal constant ERC20TOKEN_STORAGE_POSITION = 0x6ed1e8b58b8677af52e598804adae6eaacd4c419a6334c92069fde3cd6d8affc;`` it should work.
Calls to e.g. ``keccak256``, however, are not evaluated at compile-time, but rather inlined... we want to fix that and we have several long-standing issues for it e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157 - once that's finally done this should just work... but I'm not sure when that'll be :-).

Here's the original issue: #3776

@ekpyron The [changelog for Solidity 0.6.12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.6.12) says this:
*  Code Generator: Evaluate keccak256 of string literals at compile-time.

So it seems like it should work now. I am using Solidity 0.7.0

Good point :-). But that change in 0.6.12 was rather a code generation optimization - so you're right, the compiler now actually evaluates keccak256 during code generation, but that's "too late"...
So this issue is a special case of the more general problem, namely, that this works:
```
contract C {
    uint256 constant x = 3 + 1;
    function f() public returns (bytes32) {
        assembly {
            let y := x
        }
    }
}
```
while this doesn't:

```
contract C {
    uint256 constant x = uint256(3) + uint256(1);
    function f() public returns (bytes32) {
        assembly {
            let y := x
        }
    }
}
```

(the latter is not evaluated *early* enough, even though after optimization you'll likely still have ``4`` in the bytecode when referring to ``x``, i.e. it's still *eventually* evaluated during optimization...)

So I still think the most general solution to this would be to implement https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157 - but we could also think about introducing a special case for string-literal-keccak256 earlier than that, since that's a likely use for constants...

@ekpyron I gotcha. I appreciate the explanation. Thank you. Yes, a special case for string-literal-keccak256 earlier than that would be great!

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
