This is probably wrong because we might not know the base offset pointer, at least for statically-encoded types.

I may still be confused here... but for statically-encoded types ``abiDecode`` will just expect them to be encoded in place at the given offset - so that should work, right?
For dynamically-encoded types, however, on the stack we already followed the tail pointers, but (ABIFunctions.cpp:L226) will expect a pointer at the offset (relative to base offset zero) and try to follow that (which it shouldn't), right?
So for dynamically-sized types we'd at least need to use something like ``ABIFunctions::abiDecodingFunction`` directly, right? But that's not exactly right either - e.g. ``abiDecodingFunctionArray`` still expects the offset of the length on stack, but we're already past that and have both a pointer to the tail and a length on stack...
So what we basically need is (ABIFunctions.cpp:L1157+), with ``offset`` and ``length`` taken from stack, right?
I think what we need is *almost* abi decoding, but not exactly...
But yeah, I have to think through this properly tomorrow, I may still be talking garbage right now, I'm still a bit confused :-).

On the other hand, I still think this *should* be rather feasible, if we extract the suitable snippets from the ABIEncoderV2 code (maybe we can then actually have the ABIEncoderV2 code call this shared code).

I plan to implement array copying in #9725 and just use in old codegen for unimplemented things.
Maybe we can close this one?
