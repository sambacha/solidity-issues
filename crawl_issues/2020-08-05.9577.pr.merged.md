> Why?

Because we don't need it - the old optimizer doesn't use it, and the new optimizer *mostly* doesn't use it ever since we move for loop conditions into the body and the simplifier *mostly* acts on expressions without side effects anyways.
And it's very easy to miss in reviews (happened to both you and I before ;-)) and we did have critical bugs because of that.

The only issue is to make sure that the *mostly* becomes an *always* with this PR.
