The logic here is not proper yet, maybe not ever Scopable also opens a scope...

What about ``virtual bool ASTNode::opensScope() const { return false; }`` explicitly overridden in source unit, try catch, block, for, function and contract (if that's the exhaustive list, didn't check)?

It turns out that the AST nodes that open scopes and those that store their scope are two completely different things.

Most notably, FunctionTypeName opens a scope but itself does not store the scope. This makes sense is a certain way but also leads to the fact that if you start with a variable declaration in a FunctionTypeName and follow the `scope()` pointers, you will not end up at the source unit.

I don't think they can be merged, because not every ScopeOpener is a VariableScope.
