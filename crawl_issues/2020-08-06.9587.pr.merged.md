# [\#9587 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9587) `merged`: [docs] Fix broken and outdated links

Resolves #9580.

In case of the internal links the problem was caused by using `` `title <url>`_ `` syntax and putting in an anchor name instead of an  URL (e.g. `` `strings <strings>`_ ``). The correct form would be `` :ref:`strings <strings>` `` for an internal refefence and `` :doc:`strings <strings>` `` to link to a local file called `docs.rst`. See [Sphinx docs > Cross-referencing syntax](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#cross-referencing-syntax).

This is something that will keep popping up so I tried to find a way for Sphinx to detect this error for us automatically but unfortunately it's not that easy. Broken links are only detected if you use the `:ref:`/`:doc:` syntax. We could use the `linkcheck` to find broken links by running this from the `docs/` directory:
``` bash
sphinx-build -b linkcheck . _build/html
```
The problem with it is that it finds too many false-positives. For example it tries to check `https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.X.Y/solidity_0.X.Y.tar.gz` which only used in a code snippet. It also reports anchors on github as broken because they use `href="#anchor"` rather than `id="anchor"` (example: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js#example-usage-with-smtsolver-callback).

In the end I gave up and just reviewed the output of `linkcheck` manually. There were quite a few broken or outdated links and this PR fixes them.
