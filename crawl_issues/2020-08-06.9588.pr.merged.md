# [\#9588 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9588) `merged`: [docs] Fix solidity code blocks using incorrect highlighter name

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-08-06 13:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9588):

Found while fixing #9580 / #9587.

Apparently the language name must be capitalized. Otherwise `scripts/docs.sh` exits with an error (exit code = 2):

```
Warning, treated as error:
/home/cameel/data/working-set/projects/solidity/docs/natspec-format.rst:49:Could not lex literal_block as "solidity". Highlighting skipped.
```

What's weird though - why doesn't it fail in CI? We do run the script in: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.7.0/.circleci/config.yml#L635-L646
`sphinx` itself is is not listed in `docs/requirements.txt` so maybe CircleCI is running some outdated version?
