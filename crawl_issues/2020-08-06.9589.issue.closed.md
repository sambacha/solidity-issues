# [\#9589 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9589) `closed`: Replace `bool DeclarationRegistrationHelper::visit(...)` by a more generic visitor like in the Scoper
**Labels**: `medium effort`, `low impact`, `nice to have`, `refactor`

The Scoper now does most of the work of the DeclarationRegistrationHelper - we should remove the asserts in the latter and make its behaviour rely on the ground work done by the Scoper - potentially also using a generic visit function like in the Scoper.
