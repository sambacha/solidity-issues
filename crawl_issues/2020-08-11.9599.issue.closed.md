Example:
```
struct Position { int x; int y; }

Position[2] memory pos;
pos[0] = (-1, -1);
pos[1] = (1, 2);

function matches(Position memory _pos) returns (int a, int b)
{
    (a, b) = _pos;
}

function matches2(Position memory _pos) returns (int a, int b)
{
    return _pos;
}
```

Is this feature still under consideration? It would be convenient to assign a struct directly to variables listed in a LHS tuple.

Probably not in the near future. The situation is similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9598#issuecomment-733721782. We would probably accept PRs but it's not on our roadmap right now.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
