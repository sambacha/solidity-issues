Example:

```
contract S
{
    function foo(int _a, int _b) public pure { .. }

    function bar() public returns (int, int) { return (1, 2) }

    function foobar() public {
        foo(bar());
    }   
}
```

This might be convenient but we should really make this clear in the syntax, for example in the way python does it.

For those who don't know how python does it (I had to look it up): 

In Python, you can expand list, tuple, and dictionary (dict), and pass each element to function arguments.

Add * to a list or tuple and ** to a dictionary when calling a function, then elements are passed to arguments.Note the number of asterisks *.

Here, the following contents will be described.

* Expand list and tuple with *
  * With default arguments
  * With variable-length arguments
* Expand the dictionary (dict) with **
  * With default arguments
  * With variable-length arguments

This feature can be extremely useful for validation. E.g.

```solidity
function isSomethingValid() public view returns (bool, string memory);
require(isSomethingValid);
```

Right now we have to write something like
```solidity
(bool isValid, string reason) = isSomethingValid();
require(isValid, reason);
```

Syntax suggestion:
``require(..isSomethingValid())`

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
