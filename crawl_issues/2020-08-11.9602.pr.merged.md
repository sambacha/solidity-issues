Please add more tests, at least one for a calldata struct that is dynamically sized / encoded.

@chriseth I fixed some of the comments. 
Probably it was bad idea to put all of the conversions in one PR. Once you check again, if it is too hard, I can split it to one PR per converion.

Tests are failing.

> So pending the remaining split into potentially multiple variables that will be required for function types, but which we could also postpone until then, I think this is fine.
> We should make sure to have good test coverage with nested arrays and structs, etc, with the upcoming next step of also supporting arrays for all of this.

I opened issues regarding function types and arrays, linking them here for reference: #9725 #9727

> (Still :-)) looks good to me! But since #9717 is already merged, we may have to wait until after the release with merging this.

I agree. I would wait as well :-)
