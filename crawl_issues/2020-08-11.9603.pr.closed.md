Just to clarify why it got closed: we discussed this on the call today. @axic said that the goal with this PR was to get back the code coverage feature we used to have ~2 years ago but have it separately report coverage for syntax and semantic tests. The coverage config in [fizzy](https://github.com/wasmx/fizzy) has something like this and it could be ported to our repo to do what we want.
