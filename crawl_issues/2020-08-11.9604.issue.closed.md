# [\#9604 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9604) `closed`: Disallow ``this`` and ``super`` and ``_`` as identifiers.
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

I just realized that ``uint this = 4; uint super = 7; uint _ = 42;`` is still allowed and only a warning. I think the next breaking release should disallow this.
The last one is probably the most controversial one, but ``_`` is the placeholder keyword for modifiers, and I'd think it'd be nice to not have any keywords used as non-keyword in general...

While we agreed to this on a recent meeting, what do we actually mean by "disallow"? A specific error saying these are reserved identifiers?

We already have shadowing warning for `this` and `super`, but not for `_` (unless within a modifier, I guess):

```
Warning: This declaration shadows a builtin symbol.
 --> super.sol:3:5:
  |
3 |     uint this = 4; uint super = 7; uint _ = 42;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^

Warning: This declaration shadows a builtin symbol.
 --> super.sol:3:20:
  |
3 |     uint this = 4; uint super = 7; uint _ = 42;
  |                    ^^^^^^^^^^
```

Actually there is no warning inside modifiers:
```
  modifier m() {
    uint _ = 42;

    _;
  }
```

The shadowing warning for `super` and `this` are also present within free functions, so I'd definitely call the lack of shadowing warning for `_` a bug, which is happening because `_;` is turned into a specific AST node (`PlaceholderStatement`) as opposed to an identifer.

I would say disallow means it is an error to define an identifier that is called 'super', 'this' or '_'.

But on that note we should disallow any other special to be overridden, such as `msg`, `block`, `type`, etc.

I think what is more important here is to disallow `_` as an identifier given it has varying behaviour depending whether it is in a function or a modifier. Started adding tests for that when I asked the questions above.

@hrkrshnn pushed the tests I added for underscores, I think we can merge that independently.

@chriseth @axic  I was wondering what's a good way to proceed in here? One way would be to check for names of FunctionDefinition, VariableDeclaration, Modifiers etc. in SyntaxChecker. What do you think?

I'd do it in the SyntaxChecker, but some of these things are implemented in the `NameAndTypeResolver`, iirc.

Implemented in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10255
