# [\#9606 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9606) `merged`: Rewrite of the antlr grammar.

Fixes #9369.

This should be much closer to Solidity 0.7...
It's a complete rewrite, but so far it's far from perfect - but it gets exhausting quickly...
This should, however, pass the tests and should be robust against https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9331 as well...
In any case, it will need a few rounds of cleanup still.
Note to myself: among several TODOs: verify operator precedence (will probably be wrong for ``**`` without some special annotation).

String literals in solidity (especially the distinction between unicode and non-unicode literals) is still not correct.

I added another commit that extends the grammar a bit further - I think the complication is fine, since the rendering in the documentation is unaffected. And this way I could add reverse tests, i.e. test that each of our tests that involves ``ParserError``s actually fails to parse using the grammar (excluding only 5 errors - only one of them being an actual issue involving empty tuples on the LHS of assignments, the others being "import not found", docstring, license comment and pragma related).

Still not entirely sure if we should go for this complication (it's the ``local[...]`` and pre-condition ``{}?`` and post-execution ``{}`` stuff in the grammar...).

@axic I think I covered everything now. It now has proper escape sequences, shares some lexer fragments between solidity and yul (marked with comments), actually emits proper documentation for lexer fragments and is rebased and adds back a workaround for the -> whitespace stuff.

The last commit I just pushed changes the rule names in the documentation from CamelCase to dashed, which looks nicer and more consistent to me - but I can change it back, if you disagree.

@leonardoalt I think I got all of your comments.

Do I understand it correctly that the goal here is to write a grammar that only works for the current version of Solidity? Did we check who uses the grammar and for what and if that is in line with what they are doing?

Also, does anyone use the grammar outside of antlr? I'm asking because we are now using several features that go beyond the scope of simple EBNF

The main user of a similar grammar is the solidity parser linked in the issue, but that was already broken against the old grammar in our repo. Nobody I'm aware of has switched to the grammar in our repo with anything yet. Also I generally don't think a grammar targetting multiple versions makes much sense (exaggeratingly I keep saying we can just use ``anything*`` for that and it wouldn't make much difference). We can't test it, so it will break sooner or later (not that it ever really was correct in that it *could* parse all versions or even only 0.4+ correctly), the categories it will assign are weird or wrong, and maintaining it becomes increasingly impossible.
So I'd definitely say we should have a grammar targetting the current version only and people should choose a grammar based on the pragma, if they need more than that.

Rebased and squashed.

I started experimenting with a solidity fuzzer that derives from the antlr grammar. Should I rebase the fuzzer on this branch or stick to the existing grammar on `develop`?

Oh I'm sorry - I thought this was merged already!

No worries! I had already rebased, was more waiting for confirmation :-)
