In the example below it is obvious we want to call the variant with the two extra parameters, but the error does not make it obvious why we can't call it (uint -> int conversion required). A better error message showing the different types would be great.

```
	function checkStealing(uint _x, uint _y) private
	{
		CrossState[] memory stealPattern = new CrossState[](4);
                [..]
		for (uint i = 0; i < directions.length; i++)
		{
			(int xS, int yS, int xE, int yE) =
				checkPattern(_x, _y, stealPattern, directions[i].x, directions[i].y); // error here
                       [..]
		}
	}

	function checkPattern(int _x, int _y, CrossState[] memory _pattern,
		int _xStep, int _yStep) public payable
		returns(int startX, int startY, int endX, int endY)
	{ [..] }

	function checkPattern(int _x, int _y, CrossState[] memory _pattern) public returns(bool)
	{
        [...]
        }

I would also suggest to change the source location displayed here to be the entire function definition header.

I stumbled upon this issue while writing test cases with function types. The following compiles just fine (Edit: And binds to the square of function).
```
function f(uint x) pure returns (uint) { return x ** 2; }
contract C {
        function (uint) pure returns (uint) immutable i = f;
}
```

However, the following does not. The type error seems to be incorrect at first glance. Unlike @Marenz example, there is no type conversion happening so one would expect the first free function to be bound to the immutable.

```
function f(uint x) pure returns (uint) { return x ** 2; }
function f() pure returns (uint) { return 42; }
contract C {
        function (uint) pure returns (uint) immutable i = f;
}
// ----
// TypeError 2144: (170-171): No matching declaration found after variable lookup.

@bshastry this is expected. What an expression resolves to should not depend on how the expression is used later on, at least in my opinion.

Not sure I follow. Shouldn't `i` bind to `f(uint)` in the example? `i` is not used later on, so I don't understand what you mean.

Solidity follows the concept that in `x = i`, what `i` refers to does not depend on `x`, but only on the scope of `i`.

Sorry, I still don't understand :) How does the scope of `i` explain the fact that

```
function f(uint x) pure returns (uint) { return x ** 2; }
contract C {
        function (uint) pure returns (uint) immutable i = f;
}
```

compiles

but the following throws an error

```
function f(uint x) pure returns (uint) { return x ** 2; }
function f() pure returns (uint) { return 42; }
contract C {
        function (uint) pure returns (uint) immutable i = f;
}
// ----
// TypeError 2144: (170-171): No matching declaration found after variable lookup.
```

In both cases `i` (in this case `function (uint) pure returns (uint)`) is in scope because the free function should be visible in the contract and hence in scope, right?

Another case reported in #10220 by @barakman.

```solidity
contract Test {
    uint256[] private arr;

    function func(uint256 x, uint256 y) public {
        arr.push(x, y);
    }
}
```
Up to 0.5.17 the compiler used to report this:
```
Error: Wrong argument count for function call: 2 arguments given but expected 1.
```
Starting with 0.6.0 the error message is much less informative:
```
Error: Member "push" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in uint256[] storage ref.
```

@bshastry the compiler tries to resolve `f` but there are two candidates. Overload resolution does not work by checking which option would result in fewer errors, it works by looking at the types of arguments in the function call. No function is called here, so it cannot be resolved without ambiguity.

This came up again recently: #13812. The issue has a nice test case where the error messages look confusing at first glance and only after removing the overload it becomes clear why the candidates do not match.

Also, two related issues:
- #13813
- #12332

The error message you've received is indicating that there is an issue with finding a matching function declaration based on the provided arguments. It's true that the error message could be more specific and informative, especially in cases where multiple overloaded functions may match the argument types.

In your code, you have two overloaded functions named checkPattern, and you are calling one of them with specific arguments:
(int xS, int yS, int xE, int yE) = checkPattern(_x, _y, stealPattern, directions[i].x, directions[i].y);

The error message is suggesting that there are two candidate functions that could potentially match this call, but it doesn't provide detailed information about why one is not selected over the other.

To make error messages more informative, you can consider providing explicit type casting to disambiguate which function should be called. For example, you can specify the expected argument types explicitly like this:
(int xS, int yS, int xE, int yE) = checkPattern(int(_x), int(_y), stealPattern, int(directions[i].x), int(directions[i].y));


(int xS, int yS, int xE, int yE) = checkPattern(int(_x), int(_y), stealPattern, int(directions[i].x), int(directions[i].y));
By explicitly casting the arguments to their expected types (integers in this case), you help the Solidity compiler determine which overloaded function to call, and this can lead to clearer error messages if there's still a mismatch.

While it's a good practice to provide explicit type casting to disambiguate overloaded function calls, it's also important for the Solidity compiler to improve error messages to make it more apparent why one function is chosen over another when multiple overloaded functions match the argument types. This can help developers avoid unnecessary complexity in their code and make debugging easier. Consider providing feedback to the Solidity development team regarding this matter to help improve the language's usability.
