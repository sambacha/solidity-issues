# [\#9619 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9619) `merged`: Add more syntax tests for Yul

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-08-13 13:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9619):

Pulled out of #9549. The reason to merge it here, because #9549 may not be merged until 0.8.0.

Some of these tests are missing entirely currently, like the octal one.
