`from` is a keyword, but it is actually allowed as identifier as well anywhere - the only place where it actually is used as a keyword is in import statements.
We should either:
 - make it a full regular keyword that's diallowed in identifiers
or
 - add another scanner mode for imports and only make "from" a keyword in that mode.

The main argument against making `from` a keyword is that it is a really common variable name.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
