# [\#9625 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9625) `closed`: [DO NOT MERGE] clang-format

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13174375?u=52d702cb6bec53b561afa293cf9cd53ef7a63924&v=4" width="50">[hrkrshnn](https://github.com/hrkrshnn) opened issue at [2020-08-14 11:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9625):

clang-format compiled after the [patch](https://reviews.llvm.org/D33029) and some updated configuration. [Here](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) is a reference for settings.

## Problems:

### if
Instead of 
```cpp
if (
    expr1 &&
    expr2 &&
)
```

we have:
```cpp
if (expr1 &&
    expr2)
```

Because breaking after `(` seems to be only supported for comma separated "syntaxes". The "dangling" parenthesis is also not applied in this case, and also for `{`. We can fix this with a patch though.

### for
There is a space after indendation-tab(s), when range based for loops get broken after `:`. Potentially a bug that can be fixed.

I'm closing this, since this can't be merged.
