This seems to be much more complicated than initially anticipated. I think we should use UserDefinedTypeName really just for type names and thus ModifierInvocation should use an Expression instead of a UserDefinedTypeName. Maybe we can find a middle ground where we do not allow the full power of a generic expression - I think there are other places where we use UserDefinedTypeName that are actually not really type names.

Maybe the solution is to use something like `IdentifierPath` inside UserDefinedTypeName (which inherits from TypeName and has the corresponding annotation), and use IdentifierPath directly in all the other AST nodes that are not really types like InheritanceSpecifier, UsingForDirective and OverrideSpecifier.
