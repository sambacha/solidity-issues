# [\#9644 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9644) `merged`: Fixes compilation with MSVC.

operator overloads for std::vector, std::set, std::multiset have been in `dev` namespace long time ago, then moved to global namespace by @leonardoalt last year (maybe as compilation fix?) Now, MSVC is complaining, so they're moved to `std` namespace, so that the operator overloads are in the same namespace as the arguments, to make ADL happy for all 3 major compilers (Clang, GCC, MSVC).

I do not know why gcc/clang behave differently and why it started to break on MSVC though?

Why didn't you move all the operators to the std namespace? Is `+=` different than `+`?

Oh, this was a mistake, by accident. Fixed..

This, by the way, makes everything the compiler does undefined behaviour :-). (It's pretty much the prime example of what not to do in e.g. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/extending_std)

I'm not sure if we care too much, since it will of course still work... but I'd actually say we should change this back and look for a standard-conformant solution instead...

We did revert this change.

Ah, right https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9655 - didn't see that one yet (just stumbled upon this one because it had requested a review from me back then and I'm catching up on notifications), then nevermind!
