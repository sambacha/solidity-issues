Fixes #9414 

Creates a new class `Predicate` that wraps `SymbolicFunctionVariable`, used as predicates in the CHC engine.
The predicates are owned by the static map `m_predicates`, as suggested by @chriseth , and the maps in CHC only use pointers to those predicates.
Furthermore, this PR also refactors the code that constructs counterexamples, mostly moving code into the new Predicate class, making the code more robust.

This PR is more easily reviewed by looking at each commit sequentially.
