# [\#9651 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9651) `open`: Strengthen storage variables being unassigned now that we have inline assembly
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `low effort`, `low impact`, `must have eventually`

Reported by @magnus237:

The following code does not report a warning because of the self-assignment:
```
function f() external pure {
    string storage s1;
    s1 = s1; // self-assignment
    string storage s2 = s1;
  }
```

Now that we have inline-assembly access to the slots, the following code would be a better (more explicit) way of saying "please ignore the warning":
```
function f() external pure {
    string storage s1;
    assembly { s1.slot := 0 }
    string storage s2 = s1;
  }
```

Can we change the control-flow-analyzer accordingly, i.e. do not take assignments from variables into account which are themselves not yet initialized?

Since by now this is not merely a warning, but an error, this becomes breaking - but still something we should do eventually.
