Does assignment to `.slot` in inline assembly work?

Why is this only needed for inline assembly?

It doesn't work, fails with somewhere in ASTCopier. I think it is something unrelated to this PR. We can open another issue for this.

I am not sure if we can access `slot/offset` in any other way?

I changed PR to do like that, should look much better now.
