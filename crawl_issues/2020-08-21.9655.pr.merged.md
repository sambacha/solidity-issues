# [\#9655 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9655) `merged`: Fix MSVC ADL

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-08-21 22:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9655):

This suggests a fix for MSVC ADL compilation error, without adding function templates to the `stl` namespace (which, strictly speaking, seems to be UB).

The following program illustrates the issue:
```
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void operator+(vector<int>, vector<int>) {}

namespace ns
{
    struct S {};
    class C {
        friend void operator+(S, S) {}
    };

    // clang: OK
    // msvc : OK if /permissive- is specified
    void f() { vector<int>() + vector<int>(); }
}

int main() {}
```

Without **/permissive-** flag, which enables the compiler standards conformance mode, msvc gives
> error C2676: binary '+': 'std::vector<int,std::allocator<int>>' does not define this operator or a conversion to a type acceptable to the predefined operator 

In our case, the error occurred because of the recently introduced `operator+` from `SideEffects`:
```
struct SideEffects
{
    . . . .
    friend Effect operator+(Effect const& _a, Effect const& _b)
    {
        return static_cast<Effect>(std::max(static_cast<int>(_a), static_cast<int>(_b)));
    }
```
Replacing it with a simple function works too, but it would be just a workaround.

The problem is that the lookup stops when it finds some operator in a "closer" namespace, even if the types do not match, right? Wouldn't then the solution be to move all operators into the global namespace?

I think it is a part of the name lookup in general, not something ADL specific.

> Wouldn't then the solution be to move all operators into the global namespace?

Technically, it will work, but it is just a workaround. And if we do want a workaround, a local fix would be to rename the `SideEffects::operator+`.

I would keep `friend operator+`, it looks quite normal. I'd rather think about moving the global operators back to their namespaces and adding them to candidates via `using` (re `using std::swap;` idiom).

BTW defining own operators for standard types is [questioned](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl):

> Name lookup rules make it impractical to declare operators in global or user-defined namespace that operate on types from the std namespace, e.g. a custom `operator>>` or `operator+` for `std::vector` or for `std::pair` (unless the element types of the vector/pair are user-defined types, which would add their namespace to ADL). Such operators would not be looked up from template instantiations, such as the standard library algorithms. See dependent names for further details.

(Besides, a newer STL could come up with `operator+(vector, vector)`, causing potential conflicts.)

Regarding the option **/permissive-**, in general. Although changing compiler settings for big projects might be risky, the new MSVC projects got it set by default nowadays. So it might be a positive thing to have it, independently of the ADL issue.

This actually uncovers some conversion problems in ExecutionFramework. Can we fix those?

It seems that msvc was always thinking that there is more than one user conversion, but did not complain about it without **/permissive-**. Here is a way to reproduce:

```
struct A
{
    operator int() { return 0; }
};

struct B
{
    B(int) {}
};

B f() {
    A a;
    return { a }; // msvc : warning C4927 : illegal conversion; more than one user - defined conversion has been implicitly applied
                  // clang: ok
}
```
