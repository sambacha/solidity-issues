The equivalent function combiner is only run once, but I think it does not consider two functions equivalent if they call two different, but equivalent functions. Furthermore, I think it fully fails for two equivalent recursive functions.

Yeah, I think the idea at the time was that it will/should be run multiple times anyways, since functions might *become* equivalent due to optimization - and we just ignored recursive functions.
The block hasher can rather easily be adjusted to produce equal hashes in these cases (even for equivalent recursive functions) - I imagine actually comparing equivalent recursive functions for equality to be a bit of a hassle, though, but I'd need to think about it, maybe it won't be too bad...

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
