**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

## Abstract

Tracks support for the following sub-issues
  - ~~[x] #9674 Install antlr4 jar and c++ runtime package from source in `Dockerfile.ubuntu1604.clang.ossfuzz`~~
  - ~~[x] #9675 Generate antlr parser visitor for every CI build/alternatively check in auto-generated files into the Solidity repo~~
  - ~~[ ] #9676 Derive an antlr mutator class from the auto generated antlr visitor class~~
  - [ ] #9677 Add mutations for all aspects of antlr4 grammar (this will probably span a few months)

## Motivation

Currently, the solidity parser fuzzer `solc_noopt_ossfuzz` feeds pseudo-random input to the compiler.
This is augmented with a [dictionary of solidity keywords][] and [an initial set of test files][]
Although this setup is pretty good at finding bugs (mostly ICEs related to parsing solidity), it is inefficient because of a lack of grammar awareness.

This is an umbrella issue to track support for a grammar aware solidity fuzzer.
The key idea is to leverage existing [antlr4 grammar][] towards targeted mutations of test input *in addition to* pseudo-random mutations.
The hope is that this finds bugs quicker because the likelihood of generating parseable input is greater than pseudo-random alone.

## Specification

- ~~Generate antlr4 c++ visitors for Solidity grammar using antlr4 jar executable~~
- Write base visitor for different aspects of solidity grammar
- Derive from the visitor
- Mutations are added inside derived visitors

## Backwards Compatibility

TBD

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
