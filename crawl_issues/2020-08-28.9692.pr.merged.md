# [\#9692 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9692) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix soundness of array pop

Consider the following code snippet:
```
a.pop();
a.length;
```
where `a` is `uint[] a`.
Before this PR those statements were in the same CHC rule (block). The problem with that was that
- `a.pop()` adds the constraint `a_2.length = a_1.length - 1` and the check `a_1.length == 0`
- `a.length` adds the type constraints `a_2.length >= 0 /\ a_2.length < 2**256`
This implies that `a_1.length > 0` and the SMTChecker thinks the `pop` is safe, whereas it isn't.

The solution in this PR is to not decrease the length and not to wrap around when the length is 0 and `pop` is executed. At runtime this would revert. So if we want to go on and report further errors we behave as if this pop was never there, that is, by leaving the length as 0 - we do report the `empty pop detected` though.

Found a problem so I converted to draft, investigating.

Ready for review.
