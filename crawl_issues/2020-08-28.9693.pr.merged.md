# [\#9693 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9693) `merged`: CMake toolchain file cleanup

Until now the toolchain file also mandated the C++ standard to compile the source code with. This always conflicted with my windows setup (and CI) when using VCPKG. 

This PR cleans this up, and I also changed our CI config to explicitly pass `CMAKE_CXX_VERSION=20` for test-compiling against C++20.

Why was this causing a problem btw?

@axic  that's been a problem when you use Visual Studio with vcpkg (package manager). vcpkg gets passed as toolchain, so it always conflicted on my end (when working with VS) and I had always to hand-change some files that I couldn't commit/push.

This change allows us to not force local changes when using VS. Also, I think it is (should) be much cleaner now (sorry for the late delay :-) )

I think there should be a way to combine toolchain files by including one file from the other one. But if you can live without toolchain files, I'd recommend it.
