# [\#9694 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9694) `merged`: Fixes C++ narrowing conversion compile error

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2020-08-28 12:55](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9694):

This compile error only happens on MSVC (on the CircleCI), and while I understand why this error is being generated I wonder why no other compiler has caught it.

This PR is based on top of another PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9693
