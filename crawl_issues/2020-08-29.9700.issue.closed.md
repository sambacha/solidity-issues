when build solc from the source, I execute:
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && make  
the solc version is: solidity_develop_yyyy_mm_dd.commitxxx

Just create an empty file called `prerelease.txt`. If it's missing or non-empty, it's a development/prerelease build and the content of the file is included in the version string.

@chriseth I've seen people asking about it a few times already. Maybe we should mention it in https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source?

Yes! Also note that there is a source archive on the release page that contains the prerelease.txt file. So actually if you build yourself from just some source, it might be good that the version is a prerelease version, since there is no guarantee that the source is actually the one of the release.
