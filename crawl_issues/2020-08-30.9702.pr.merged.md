# [\#9702 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9702) `merged`: Fix ICE caused by an array of mappings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-08-30 14:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9702):

Fixes #7410 by disallowing `.push(<arg>)` for storage arrays with mappings.

@chriseth @leonardoalt @hrkrshnn 

~~From the #7410 discussion, I somewhat concluded that the idea is to forbid arrays with (nested) mappings.~~

~~I added a simple check and updated several test cases (more needs to be updated). Is it the intended direction? The impact (in terms of the number of failing tests) is rather big.~~

Disallows `.push(<arg>)` ~~and `.pop()`~~ for storage arrays with nested mappings.

I don't think we should disallow them - sorry :)

Should we move #7410 back from the implementation backlog then? Or is there a consensus how to proceed?

One way to proceed is to disallow `push` and `pop` for arrays (state variables) containing mappings.

@hrkrshnn I just noticed that we already have an issue about that in the design backlog so it's probably the way to go: #8535.

Several tests fail because of `.pop()`. Should I push to `breaking`?

Disallowing `.push(<arg>)` is a bugfix to develop. Disallowing `.pop()` should be a feature for breaking (if we want it).

Just out of curiosity: `.push()` is fine, right?

In the sense that it does not crash the compiler, yes.
