# [\#9703 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9703) `merged`: Corrected warning for homonymous, but not shadowing declarations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-08-30 18:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9703):

Fixes #4558.

Can you check this, please?
```
function e() {}
contract test {
    function f() public pure { uint e; uint t; }
}
funciton t() {}
```

```
function e() {}
contract test {
    function f() pure public { uint e; uint g; uint h; }
    function g() pure public {}
}
function h() {}
```

We warn about shadowiing `e()` only. `g()` and `h()` go unnoticed.

I also saw that we do not seem to consider declarations which go after the current one. I wanted to address it as a separate issue when this PR is completed.

Right, the "no shadowing warning for later declarations" is a different issue.

Please add a changelog entry - fine otherwise!

Oh and maybe `_declaration.isVisibleInContract()` would also be better than checking for external visibility - which is a quite specific property.

Done.

Do you mean `bool _invisible` in `DeclarationContainer::registerDeclaration` and related things? It could make sense, let me have a closer look.

@chriseth 

> Do you think a solution including the "invisible" flag would be possible?

Consider
```
contract C {
    function f() public pure {
        uint x;
        { uint x; }
    }
}
```

If `invisible = (!_declaration.isVisibleInContract() || _inactive)`, then both `x` are invisible, right (because they are in the block scope, hence inactive)? Then the warning would be "This declaration has the same name as another declaration.", while it should be "This declaration shadows an existing declaration.".

Or did I misunderstand you?

I think the error looks fine. It's maybe not that important after all. Also in your example - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9703/files#diff-5d15f07f01f7bb76a8c6410ee3b1a6e1R6 - I would say this should be shadowing, since they are different scopes.

But to sum up: I think it is better to use a flag native to the NameAndTypeResolver instead of something that is only usable inside contracts.

I'm a bit confused. Do you mean **name_shadowing2.sol** or **name_pseudo_shadowing.sol**?

**name_shadowing2.sol** already reports "shadowing", and **name_pseudo_shadowing.sol** is _not_ shadowing, according to #4558.

What do we mean by "shadowing" exactly? My rough definition would be that "new x" shadows "old x" iff removing "new x" would not break compilation, and all references of "new x" would become references to "old x".
