# [\#9715 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9715) `merged`: OSX: Fix readlink & ASTImportTest.sh issues.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5008794?u=aa5f725afdad81154a79cd5ab6be9340b08da4a9&v=4" width="50">[aarlt](https://github.com/aarlt) opened issue at [2020-09-01 00:31](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9715):

Fix #9711 and #9712. Also see #9710. 

This is probably not the cleanest solution. 

- `scripts/splitSources.py` - system exception hook will print message and will result code `3`. This will be treated as a critical error by `scripts/ASTImportTest.sh`.  If an `UnicodeDecodeError` exception occurs, the script will result code `2`, `scripts/ASTImportTest.sh` will ignore this, but will print stdout of the python script. The semantic of result code `0` and `1` are the same as before: `0` means that there was code extracted from a multi-source file and `1` means that the file was not a multi-source file. Also regarding #9710: splitting of multi-source files containing invalid utf-8 sequences is still not implemented.

- `scripts/ASTImportTest.sh` - use of `greadlink` on osx #9712. fix that it silently ignores errors by adding result code handling for `scripts/splitSources.py` #9711. 

- `scripts/test_antlr_grammar.sh` - use of `greadlink` on osx.
