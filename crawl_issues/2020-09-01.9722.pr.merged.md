Thank you for the review @cameel . I will slowly work through your feedback and try to make the code cleaner and make it conform to our coding style.

@bshastry I noticed you pushed a few hours ago, is this ready for review again?

Sorry for the late update on this PR @leonardoalt  and @cameel 

There have been some changes, hopefully for the better. 
  - Removed antlr4 dependency since it didn't really serve original use case (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10044)
  - Removed everything from this PR except a basic skeleton for quicker re-review
  - Generator currently only "generates" `pragma solidity >= 0.0.0;` but of course future reviews will incorporate grammar elements found in the Solidity antlr grammar spec. This will be written in C++ with minimal dependencies.

Might also need a rebase

Rebased. Not sure why spellcheck failed since its complaints are unrelated to this PR.
