There seems to be a problem with super lookup.

It seems we do resolve the function properly, but then directly call another funciton.

It looks like `void IRGeneratorForStatements::endVisit(FunctionCall const& _functionCall)` performs a shortcut while it should not have.

Fixed.

The code path should be the same as assigning `super.f` to a variable or using it inside parenthesized expression.

The problem with `super.f` is that it depends on the contract currently being compiled, while all the type information is the same regardless of which contract is currently being compiled. So the only choice would be to not assign anything to `referencedDeclaration`.

Right... maybe it *would* be better not to assign anything to ``referencedDeclaration`` then, though :-). But yeah, not crucial I guess.

If we don't assign then we don't really know where to start searching - but maybe we can add a flag.
