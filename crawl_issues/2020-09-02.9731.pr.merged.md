Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9667

This PR fix some issues with the CHC encoding:
- The `genesis` predicate is actually not needed anymore since we started using nonlinear Horn clauses
- The `interface` and `nondet_interface` predicates for contracts were applied to the wrong contract
- The block counter wasn't reset
- The CHC solver wasn't reset

@mijovic I think I found the problematic test. Can you reapprove?

Btw, do you have any viable explanation why the test was problematic?

I don't, but I got it to fail 100% of the time even locally on my laptop.
