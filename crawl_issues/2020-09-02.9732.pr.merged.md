# [\#9732 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9732) `merged`: Drop i386 from the PPA release script.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-09-02 16:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9732):

Ubuntu dropped support after bionic, so the builds for newer versions won't even attempt to build an i386 version - and the bionic i386 build has been failing for ages now with no-one complaining...

So at this point we might as well drop it from being marked as supported for the package.

The alternative would be to have a 32-bit linux test build...

Ping @chriseth
