@chriseth I added a description how to do this manually. I also saw that the used SPDX identifier is `deprecated`, so I tested the manual steps by updating the license (see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/61245). Basically `GPL-3.0` is not a valid SPDX identifier anymore, but `GPL-3.0-only` and `GPL-3.0-or-later` where introduced. ~For now I changed the license to `GPL-3.0-only`. Is that license correct?~

@chriseth What would you say is the license that should be supplied in the formula? just `GPL-3.0-or-later` or something like `all_of: ["GPL-3.0-or-later", "MIT", "BSD-3-Clause", "Apache-2.0", "CC0-1.0"]` as suggested in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/61245?

I'm not sure what the meaning of `all_of` is, but "gpl-3.0 or later" is the right license for the bulk of the source.

Hi, Homebrew maintainer here.

The `all_of:` indicates that there are multiple licenses that need to apply. See [Homebrew's License Guidelines](https://docs.brew.sh/License-Guidelines) for more information about the syntax here.

Thus, the suggested line:

```ruby
license all_of: ["GPL-3.0-or-later", "MIT", "BSD-3-Clause", "Apache-2.0", "CC0-1.0"]
```

is equivalent to the SPDX identifier: `GPL-3.0-or-later AND MIT AND BSD-3-Clause AND Apache-2.0 AND CC0-1.0` (more info about SPDX license expressions [here](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/appendix-IV-SPDX-license-expressions/))

It is possible that `GPL-3.0-or-later` is all that's needed. I only brought up the issue of the other licenses because I saw this statement in the [`README`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity#license):

> Some third-party code has its [own licensing terms](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/templates/license.h.in).

I got the specific licenses from [`cmake/templates/license.h.in`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/templates/license.h.in) (which is where the link directs).

Does this help to clear things up?

@Rylan12 Thank you for the clarification. We decided to go with `all_of`. I updated my PR.

Please squash and mention the wording in the PR description that causes this to be recognized as created by the script.

@chriseth I'm not sure I get what you mean. There is no reason that the PR need to be recognised as created by the script. A normal PR should work. The only thing may be that the commit message should be `solidity x.y.z`, if the formula was updated to version `x.y.z`.  But it seem to be  not a strict requirement.

If you make the PR look like it was generated by the utility, it gets merged quicker.
