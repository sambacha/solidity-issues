# [\#9738 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9738) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Implementing copying of arrays to storage 

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23421619?u=50068b46fd9aafcb2b59c0d93b9eb49692ba9c66&v=4" width="50">[mijovic](https://github.com/mijovic) opened issue at [2020-09-04 09:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9738):

Code is ready for review.

TODO:
- [x] Adding more tests with nested arrays, arrays of structs, structs containing arrays,...
- [x] Remove calls to index access functions
- [ ] Optimize number of calls to `sstore` (try writing multiple array members at once if multi members fit one slot) (we agreed this will be a part of other PR, there is an issue for that now #9831)
- [x] Clear storage array with zeros when copying smaller array

Depends on:
- #9843
- #9905

Fixes #9037

Also as a general note: I may have been blind and just not seen it, but I think it's missing in the PR:
Storage has to be zeroed out in case the array used to be larger.
I.e. this:
```
contract C {
  uint256[] x;
  function f() public returns(uint256) {
    x.push(42); x.push(42);
    uint256[] memory y = new uint256[](1);
    y[0] = 23;
    x = y;
    assembly { sstore(x.slot, 2) } // overwrite length to 2, s.t. we can easily access the second element that should have been cleared
    return x[1];
  }
}
```
has to return ``0``, not ``42``.

I am adding tests for these. I used `resizeDynamicArrayFunction` to clear unused part of the array and write new length. It works for types greater than 16bytes as it is just clearing whole slot. Now I am fixing it to work with smaller types.

What's the state of this - is this still ready to be reviewed given everything that was extracted from it? If so, ping me about it. It asks for a rebase in any case (maybe even better to wait until https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9985 is merged with it, that'll probably require another rebase).

I'll do rebase and will need to remove some things from here.
When done, will ping you :-)

I rebased and solved conflicts. Pushed just in case. Will now be fixing PR. Please do not review still :-)

@chriseth Combined into one function. 
Probably most of this can be used for copying from storage to storage when implementing that part.
