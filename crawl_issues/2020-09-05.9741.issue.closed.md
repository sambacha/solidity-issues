We are hitting that smtAssert because in the class TupleSort, in the operator==, we are comparing "members", which has the following values:

"members" field in Tuple (1, 2) has the following two elements:
tuple(int_const 1,int_const 2)_accessor_0
tuple(int_const 1,int_const 2)_accessor_1

"members" field in Tuple (3, 4) has the following two elements:
tuple(int_const 3,int_const 4)_accessor_0
tuple(int_const 3,int_const 4)_accessor_1

Since those strings are different, TupleSort operator== is returning false causing that smtAssert to hit.

I'm not sure about the best way to solve this issue. Any suggestion?

@cakesoft-arpit Yea that's an annoying case with RationalNumberTypes that put the value itself into the type name. I started looking into it yesterday and might have a fix today.
