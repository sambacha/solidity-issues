    return array2d[2];
  }
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):

The fuzzer found a smaller test case

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract A{function f()public{delete([""][0]);}}
```

Perhaps this issue has to do with SMT checker throwing an ICE when deleting dynamically sized storage array at the same time as expanding the array via a `push` op.

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
  int[] a;
  function f() public { delete a.push(); }
}
```

throws https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/58579332473bc28add0d8439498df6988957ce7e/libsolidity/formal/SMTEncoder.cpp#L510

Reopening because the following test case causes a similar assertion failure

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
  struct S {
    int[][] d;
  }
  S[] data;
  function f() public {
    ++data[1].d[3].push();
  }
}
```
