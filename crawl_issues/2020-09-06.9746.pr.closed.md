# [\#9746 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9746) `closed`: Refactor oversized type checking
**Labels**: `takeover`

Oversized types lead to compilation errors and collision warnings. The logic of both cases is similar, but not the same. This PR suggests some unification.

@cameel 
I did several requested changes to shorten the list and commented some others. Please make the conversations as resolved when applicable.

My general idea is to agree on the overall approach first, and then do tactical optimizations.

Please rebase on #9791.

Just some squashing and rebasing. Do not get distracted, let's finish #9818 first.

Implementation of `ArrayType::sizeUpperBound` is based on the old one. As @cameel indicated, it might be good to have it recursive instead. I plan to do it next, as soon as we are OK the overall design.

Similarly, `validForLocation` has quadratic complexity, which can be changed to linear relatively easily.

I think that this issue really needs some more tests to make sure the corner cases we're discussing actually work as intended in practice.

Is this refactor still valid nowadays?

I think so. It was related to one of the bugs I have assigned and wanted to fix - it was modifying the same code. The problem is that assessing the effect of all of these size changes was a bit hard and there are still some open questions here.

Honestly, it's been so much time since this has been started that I think it would be easier to just start fresh. But if someone is willing to take over, we could also continue here.

On the call today we decided to close this. I'm probably going to go back to that bugfix at some point and I can reuse parts from here but I don't really want to take over the whole PR.
