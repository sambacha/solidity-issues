# [\#9747 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9747) `closed`: abi.decode with pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2 reverts with 2-dimensional array

Compiler: 0.5.7
Test set up: Remix on ropsten

I have a function with a parameter of bytes calldata that needs to be decoded to a struct, but the call reverts in assembly. I believe the issue has something to do with the nested array. I have used a similar technique with only a 1-dimensional array in the struct and it seems to work OK.

```
struct InputParams {
    address[] exchangeAddresses;
    address[][] exchangePoolOrPaths;
    address[] tokenAddresses;
    uint256 tokenStartAmount;
    uint256[] tokenAmountsExpected;
}

function execute(uint blockNumber, bytes calldata data, bool admin) external 
{
    InputParams memory params = abi.decode(data, (InputParams));  // this reverts in assembly
}
```

Inspecting the raw input to transacting with this function does not provide much info. I parsed out below the separate parameters and they seem to be encoded OK:

Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be here, or is this a bug?

Hi All,  
I think I simplified the problem case.  I think there's an issue with decode and dynamic arrays inside structs.

What works:
```
    struct InputParams
    {
        address[2] exchangeAddresses;
    }

    function execute(uint blockNumber, bytes calldata data, bool admin) external
    {
        InputParams memory params = abi.decode(data, (InputParams));
    }

with calldata:

0xb83775a0
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000040
000000000000000000000000b5ffd0a221fc94de9255382e70ce1aec76b68c89
0000000000000000000000003b3d4eefdc603b232907a7f3d0ed1eea5c62b5f7
```

What does not work (reverts during decode):


```
    struct InputParams
    {
        address[] exchangeAddresses;
    }

    function execute(uint blockNumber, bytes calldata data, bool admin) external
    {
        InputParams memory params = abi.decode(data, (InputParams));
    }

with calldata:

0xb83775a0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```

Let me know if I can provide more info and if I am actually just passing incorrect calldata...

The content of `data` is not encoded correctly for `abi.decode()`. That builtin expects a tuple, even if the tuple contains just a single value. In your case it must be a single-element tuple containing the `InputParams` struct but you're giving it that struct directly, not wrapped in anything.

The working example above works because `address[2]` is a static type and a single-element tuple containing such a type looks exactly like that type when encoded (it does not have a separate header containing offsets).

Awesome, thanks for the insight!

So how can `abi.encode()` when struct is `address[] exchangeAddresses`
