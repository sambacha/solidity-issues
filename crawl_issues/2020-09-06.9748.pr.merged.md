# [\#9748 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9748) `merged`: Forbid implicit conversion from a contract to super

Fixes #9596.

At some point in the future #7744 will make such conversion impossible anyway so I think forbidding it should not be controversial. All the tests still pass after doing so.

I tried to come up in some other situations where this conversion could happen but the only one I found so far are operators.

Ah sorry, needs another rebase. Also I think the changelog entry can be shortened a bit.

Rebased and changelog shortened. I hope it's better now.
