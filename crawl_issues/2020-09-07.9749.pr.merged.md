# [\#9749 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9749) `merged`: Fix typo: "fallback" should be "receive"

I believe the modified line is referring to the `receive` function instead of the fallback function.
If that's incorrect, I'd suggest rewording it to make it clear that we're discussing the fallback function in the `receive` section.
