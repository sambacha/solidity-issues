I expected some of the elements in the AST that used to be UserDefinedTypeName to be replaced by IdentifierPath - wasn't that the idea behind the refactoring?

Sorry to complicate this even more, but I think we should take more care about whether or not to perform virtual lookup. I think all annotations that have `referencedDeclaration` should have another field that says whether or not virtual or super lookup is to be performed. Then we can properly match the type checker with the code generator on these using assertions.

Is this PR depending on any other PRs?

Yes, this one: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9820

Which also means we need to merge develop into breaking again
