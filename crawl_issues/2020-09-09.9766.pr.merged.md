# [\#9766 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9766) `merged`: Fix overload resolution with named arguments when order differs from declaration

Fixes #9752.

We have several places where named arguments are matched to parameters. Maybe it is better to do this just once and store the index mapping in FunctionCallAnnotation?

@chriseth Functions don't usually have many parameters so I doubt it's worth it from performance standpoint. But reducing duplication might be. Maybe a common function that does the matching would be better? I could do it in a separate refactoring PR if you want.

I moved my event tests from this PR  to `events/` and also added a small refactoring PR that moves other tests that were already there: #9768.

Yes, my comment was with regards to code cleanup, not performance. I'm fine with either just computing the mapping again (but guaranteed in the same way) or storing it in the annotations.
