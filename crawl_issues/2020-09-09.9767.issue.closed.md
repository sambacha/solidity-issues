# [\#9767 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9767) `closed`: [Sol->Yul] Implement member access for arrays in calldata structs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23421619?u=50068b46fd9aafcb2b59c0d93b9eb49692ba9c66&v=4" width="50">[mijovic](https://github.com/mijovic) opened issue at [2020-09-09 12:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9767):

Member access for calldata structs is implemented. However, if struct contains arrays, member access is failing for these.

example:

```
contract C {
    struct S {
        uint128[3] a;
    }

    S[] s;

    function f(S[] calldata c) external {
        s = c;
        assert(s[1].a[0] == c[1].a[0]);
    }
}
```

Fails as `c[1].a[0]` fails because member access doesn't support arrays
