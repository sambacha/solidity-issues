- adds language design subsection
- harmonizes capitalization and punctuation 
- restructures the order of the sub-sections to follow the order of the 1st bullet list

Edit: I recently read an article on how to make text more accessible for disabled people and one measure is to introduce full stop points at the end of each bullet point so that reading tools read it out correctly. 

closes #9473

I think you need to rebase over `develop` to get some bugfixes from there.
