# [\#9783 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9783) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Fix slow tests for classic genetic algorithm

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-09-11 20:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9783):

Fixes #9343 and re-enables the disabled tests.

Turns out that the thing that was slowing tests was my last-minute change to `isFitter()` function to make chromosome comparisons deterministic. The change was a lexicographic comparison if length and fitness of both chromosomes were the same. The worst case scenario for this is a huge population of many long identical chromosomes - and that's exactly the case in the affected tests. The comparison was not very heavy on its own but still much heavier than iterating over a string and it's a very common operation. It involved iterating over the chromosome and looking up every step name in a map.

My fix is a refactor suggested at some point by @chriseth - making `Chromosome` store the string of abbreviations rather than a vector of optimisation step names. This way the string conversion is now basically free.

The re-enabled tests are now back to running in ~1 second (down from ~70 seconds before refactoring).
