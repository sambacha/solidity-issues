# [\#9784 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9784) `merged`: [yul-phaser] Make phaser tests less brittle

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-09-11 20:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9784):

This PR replaces three mutation tests that had the expected random results hard-coded for a given seed. The new tests just check the expected value and variance of the random effects of mutations.

Another change are the increased tolerance and number of samples in two chromosome tests that also check variance and expected value. @chriseth reported that they tend do break easily. That's because the original tolerances and sample numbers are deliberately low to make them fast.

This change makes phaser tests take about 1.5 seconds, which is a lot compared to ~0.25 previously, but practically nothing compared to the runtime of other tests.

EDIT: Depends on #9783 (sorry for not mentioning it earlier!).
