Warning: Assertion checker does not yet implement this type of function call.

I don't think the SMT checker needs to do anything with events though, just ignore them and don't emit a warning.

Could also include the low-levels logs, `log0()` to `log4()`.

Agree. The arguments should still be visited for side effects.
