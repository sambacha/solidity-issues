First step in a series of PRs to update the Z3 version everywhere.
I haven't run the script yet, so please ping me, once we're clear that we go through with this before the next release, then I'll run it and link the build status here :-).

Should be the last merged.
Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9797

4.8.7 or 4.8.9 ?

Damn - commit message was wrong, I'll fix.

Builds are running (https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps/+packages).
Apparently ``eoan`` is already out of support and doesn't accept new uploads, so I'll remove it from the script.
