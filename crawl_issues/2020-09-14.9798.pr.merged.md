Changelog conflict, but might wanna fix only after we merge the revert PR (or make that one the target of this one)

Because you keep merging stuff while I'm waiting for CI. And then I wait another 3 hours for CI :)

I think this is weird z3 error. As far as I know it is not related to this PR, but @leonardoalt can confirm probably.

Ughhhh that's annoying. That's the same thing we had in the previous version. At some point I figured the shift test from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9807 was the culprit and removed it. In that PR I readded tests that used to be problematic, I guess one of them is causing trouble again. So annoying.

I think we can merge this

I think we need to find out the buggy test before it propagates to develop like last time.
