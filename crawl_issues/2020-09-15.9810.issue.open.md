See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1985. The limits in it mostly mirror what is in geth. There is a plan to finalise this EIP, perhaps should not do most of this in SMTChecker before it is finalised.

Interesting. This EIP specifies the maximum memory size which is relevant for #8382 and #9746 too. I was actually wondering if there was some official upper limit on that.

The EIP is flagged as stagnant. Do we still want to apply those limits @leonardoalt?

Sure, we could do it. Some of them might not be applicable because they're too low level, but might be a low hanging fruit.
