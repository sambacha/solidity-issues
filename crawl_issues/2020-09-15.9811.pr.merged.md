# [\#9811 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9811) `merged`: Completely static Windows build on CircleCI

~~Once this works I'll move some more logic to scripts - just checking how CI behaves so far.~~

For the record: so far I get 3.5 minutes to build and install boost (and cmake) on cache mismatch, and <30 seconds for cache restore - but for some reason the actual solidity build takes a bit more than half an hour so far (which is more than in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9476 - and I'm pretty sure that cannot only be due to the completely static linking), so I'm still trying to figure out why that is and if it can be improved.
The newer boost version could affect build times, but I'd still not expect that much of a difference...

The bulid times are still better than appveyor, aren't they?

Actually with the ``msbuild`` build command I just tried instead of the ``cmake --build`` command it's down to 20 minutes, which is in line with the other PR - weird that that makes that much of a difference, but well. And yes, that's better than appveyor (which is also at ~35 minutes I think, once it actually started).

So I think I'll extend this by the release logic and tests now.

Fine apart from the question whether we want the artifact to be a zip - but I think we can just merge as is now.

Please note that this doesn't properly deal with the distinction between develop and release builds yet (i.e. it doesn't create prerelease and commit hash files yet) - I'll take care of that in a separate PR.
