# [\#9818 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9818) `merged`: Introduce CompositeType

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-09-16 02:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9818):

Part of #9746.

The idea is to decompose a type into its subtypes, and then check if subtypes are good for the given location. This PR addresses the collision-in-storage warnings only, the next one should re-use the same machinery in the context of `validForLocation`.

In principle, we could place `decomposition()` and `fullDecomposition()` functions to `Type`, but it is already a bit crowded. Introducing `CompositeType` might be a cleaner option.

Contract is a value type and thus should not have parts, I would argue. Tuple type sounds like it should return its components in that function.

But it groups together a bunch of variables which occupy storage. So I guess it should also undergo the same size calculation as other composite types and get a warning if the variables taken together take up too much space?

EDIT: But I can see why we might not want to go there anyway, [like in case of tuples](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9818#pullrequestreview-490228885).
