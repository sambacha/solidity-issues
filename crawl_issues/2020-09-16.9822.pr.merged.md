Please wait a moment with merging it. Looks like maybe it actually does fix #9821 too. If so, I'll need to add extra tests.

Yeah, it does fix it. I must have checked that case on a build from before the fix because now I can't reproduce it and in the code the same function (`isImplicitlyConvertibleTo()`) is used for both.

Now this PR is ready for review again. I only added an extra test case and updated the changelog entry.
