# [\#9824 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9824) `closed`: Move away from INVALID and use custom error types instead.
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-09-16 13:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9824):

Since checked arithmetic might be used for input validation, the need to move away from the invalid opcode (which consumes all gas) is stronger once we make checked arithmetic the default.

The middle ground between just using `revert()` for all internal errors and using the invalid opcode is introducing different error types (#7877) for `revert()` and internal errors.

The following situations currently or potentially in the future generate internal errors which we regard as "should never happen":

 - overflow/underflow
 - division / mod by zero
 - array out of bounds access
 - enum type conversion error
 - calling an uninitialized internal function pointer
 - assert with false condition

The following error situations are considered as "validating input" and thus might be OK to happen:

 - abi decoding error
 - calls returning "error"
 - require with false condition
 - calling a contract that contains no code
 - a non-payable function receiving ether

The bottom ones either use empty returndata or the signature of `Error(string)` if a reason was provided.

We could create individual errors for the "should never happen" errors (and also for the others), but I would guess that people will not ant to react differently to each of them anyway (user-defined errors are a different matter).

So maybe we should just create a single error type that is used in that case? Should it contain a message?

Suggestions for the name:
 - `Panic()`
 - `Failure()`
 - `Fault()`
 - `Critical()`
 - `CriticalError()`

I'm _really_ not sure if that's a good idea :-) - but we could for each of them introduce an integer-encoded error code that explains what happens...
So for example if we consider all the arithmetic errors and arrays out of bounds accesses as ``Panic``, we could have
``Panic(uint256)`` and define some bit schema indicating hierarchical error types...
Like ``0x01xxxxxxxx`` is arithmetic errors... ``0x0100000001`` is overflow on addition, ``0x0100000002`` is underflow on (signed) addition, ``0x0100001001`` is overflow on multiplication, etc....
and ``0x02xxxxxxxx`` is access errors... ``0x0200000001`` is access past the end of an array, ``0x0200000002`` is too large array index, etc...

But yeah - while it would be a cheap and nice way to be both coarse and fine-grained in error reporting... maintaining a list of this that then will never break would probably drive us mad :-).

While this is a good idea, still the main question is if such a distinction is useful. What you want to know is in which context the error happened and not what kind of error happened. Note that since we have error forwarding, it can also have happened inside a called contract.

I think it is kind of set that we want to be able to distinguish between `Panic` and `Error`. What if we use `Panic(uint)` to allow for potential error codes, but always use `0` as "unknown panic" for now and potentially introduce such a hierarchy in the future?

The reason behind using `Panic(uint256)` with `0` for everything instead of `Panic()` for now is that people only need one catch statement for both cases - for the same reason we did not want to introduce different error kinds for ArithmeticError, FunctionDoesNotExistError and so on.

I think that it's dangerous to allow handling `Panic`s without providing specific error codes. If relying on built-in safe math for validation becomes a pattern then people will want to be able to catch these errors in some situations. But without error codes it's not possible to do so without silencing failed assertions at the same time.

For that reason maybe it would make more sense to just reclassify overflow/underflow as something allowed to happen? They stand out to me as the only case where checks are tricky enough to make users not want to validate the input explicitly.

You can switch from checked to wrapping arithmetic using the `unchecked` keyword. Even if you catch an error, it still means that the call reverted, you cannot "un-revert" it. it might also be that the error originated in a call further down the line. Just because there was an arithmetic error does not mean it was the one arithmetic error you thought about.

Because of that, I think catching an error and especially reacting on it depending on the reason has a very limited use-case.

But if I switch to `unchecked` then I won't be able to catch safe math errors. I'm thinking about the opposite situation because I think these errors are the ones people are most likely to consider non-fatal.

The use case for catching a `Panic` at all is very limited but we're still allowing it. In my opinion, if you want to catch it, you're likely to care which one it is and silencing the others is probably an unwanted side-effect.

I still don't properly understand the use-case, but I do want fine-grained error codes, just as a second step to make quicker progress on this.

We could add `Panic` as the first step and just not provide any mechanism to handle it until we have error codes. That way it's still cheap (not using `INVALID`) but people are not encouraged to silence all panics indiscriminately at Solidity level. They can only do it outside of the transaction.

But I don't have a specific use case so it might well be that this is not relevant in practical use. It's just my general opinion that silencing stuff in a broad way is a bad practice and this approach might encourage it in some situations without giving the user an alternative. It's also that it's not clear to me how long the gap between the first and the second step will be and in the worst case we might be stuck with just the first one for quite some time.

Got and email from Franziska Heintel about this topic. Replying here, as she requested.

Yes and yes. Awesome that this is being implemented.

This sounds good to me. As someone else mentioned on the email thread: it would be more convenient to also have a string description of what the error code means. Like you said 0 means "unknown panic". However, I'm assuming these codes will be clearly documented on https://solidity.readthedocs.io/ so if one doesn't know the code, they can quickly look it up.

The following situations currently create an invalid opcode or a Panic in the future:

 - failing assert()
 - arithmetic overflow in addition, multiplication, exponentation, negation, ...
 - arithmetic underflow in addition, multiplication, exponentation, negation, ...
 - division / modulo by zero
 - array too large (either storage or memory)
 - memory allocation error (too much memory required for something)
 - empty array pop
 - array out of bounds access
 - enum conversion error
 - calling invalid internal function

Note that the old code-generator still contains code that uses "invalid opcode".

Suggestions for how to assign error codes:
 - `0x00`: generic / unspecified error. Used by `assert()`.
 - `0x11`: arithmetic underflow or overflow
 - `0x12`: division or modulo by zero
 - `0x21`: enum conversion error
 - `0x31`: empty array pop
 - `0x32`: array out of bounds access
 - `0x41`: resource error (too large allocation or too large array)
 - `0x51`: calling invalid internal function

I wonder whether we should be more generous and at least use 16 bits for it and reserve 256 slots in each category or even more... it's not like we don't have enough space in the uint256. Just, s.t. if we ever need a larger category, it's can still be the same part that designates the category.

My motivation for staying within one byte is to save deployment gas costs.

I would also be good to be able to identify abi decoding errors. Especially using abiencoder v2, there is usually quite a few paths that end at the decoding stage already if one doesn't specialize the calldata to a specific function signature.

@mrchico abi decoding errors will either return no data or data with a signature of `Error(string)`. The codes we are currently talking about will all use `Panic(uint256)`. We can of course talk about making abi decoding errors more specific, but that would be a different discussion.

@chriseth The proposal looks good to me. The only change I would consider is not using `0x00` for `assert` violations, but specifying a designated (non-generic) error code for such cases (e.g., `0x61`). This should ensure that program analysis tools that only care about assertions can reliably detect them even if for some reason future Solidity versions emit `0x00` for other generic/unspecified errors.

> My motivation for staying within one byte is to save deployment gas costs.

In all of my time as a dapp developer I have never seen anyone care about contract deployment gas costs.  Runtime gas costs are all that anyone I have talked to cares about.  For deployment, either you are deploying a contract once (ever) or you are deploying multiple copies of a contract that has a very high per-contract value (where gas costs are negligible compared to what you are doing) or you are using a proxy.

I have heard this argument of "to reduce deployment gas costs" come up multiple times from the Solidity dev team, and I would like to better understand where it comes from?  Who are these people who care about deployment gas costs?  What situation are they in where that is a thing that matters?

@wuestholz this is a very good suggestion! It allows analysis tools to distinguish between explicit `assert(x)` statements and "compiler-internal" assertions.

@MicahZoltu people are not worried about deployment gas costs, but they are worried about staying within the code size limit, so i think it is still reasonable to only use a single byte for the error code.

For now, I allocated `0x01` for `assert(false)` since it is still a "generic" error because you do not specify the reason.

We briefly discussed today whether 
a) we should introduce a `panic(code)` helper for inline assembly which does the encoding,
b) and whether we would encourage users to use it instead of `invalid()`.

The answer to b) was yes. The answer to a) is that some prefer to do this via #9282 and also considering the "standard library".

Please note one can manually encode the panics in inline assembly:
```
// Assuming `code` is <=255
function panic(code) {
  // This is using the scratch space, but could use anything given we revert.
  mstore(0, shl(0x4e487b71, 248))
  mstore(32, 0)
  mstore8(36, code)
  revert(0, 36)
}
```

Also see a similar discussion about `assert`/`require` in #7317.

Note that "could use anything given we revert" is not true anymore if we want to properly support the stack limit evader.

Well, as long as the `memoryguard` is used properly (such as in a custom allocator), then it is not a problem. Isn't it?
