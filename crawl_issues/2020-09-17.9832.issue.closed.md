# [\#9832 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9832) `closed`: Bug when resizing array in storage for types smaller than 17 bytes
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `codegen error`

Consider following example:

```
contract C {
    uint128[] x;
    function f() public returns(uint128) {
        x.push(42); x.push(42); x.push(42); x.push(42);
        uint128[] memory y = new uint128[](1);
        y[0] = 23;
        x = y;
        assembly { sstore(x.slot, 4) }
        assert(x[1] == 0);
        assert(x[2] == 0);
        assert(x[3] == 0);
    }
}
```

Third assert fails, and it shouldn't fail as array should be cleaned when resized to smaller array.
