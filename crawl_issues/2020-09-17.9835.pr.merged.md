# [\#9835 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9835) `merged`: Add missing checks for parameter compatibility with ABIEncoderV1 in calls

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-09-17 13:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9835):

Fixes #8379.
Fixes #9728.
Fixes #9270.

The fix is to add an extra check in `TypeChecker` and return a compilation error instead of triggering an ICE or an `UnimplementedError`.

Added missing changelog entry.

Looks like my fix is breaking the Colony contract in CI: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/8445/workflows/d92b2fd9-0def-4f15-9600-0dddd9d4f45e/jobs/443473

The code that fails is in [validGlobalSkill() modifier](https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/colonyNetwork/blob/develop/contracts/colony/ColonyStorage.sol#L149-L155)
```solidity
  modifier validGlobalSkill(uint256 _skillId) {
    IColonyNetwork colonyNetworkContract = IColonyNetwork(colonyNetworkAddress);
    Skill memory skill = colonyNetworkContract.getSkill(_skillId);
    require(skill.globalSkill, "colony-not-global-skill");
    require(!skill.deprecated, "colony-deprecated-global-skill");
    _;
  }
```

The file it's in does not use the `ABIEncoderV2` pragma while [IColonyNetwork](https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/colonyNetwork/blob/develop/contracts/colonyNetwork/IColonyNetwork.sol) does. And `getSkill()` returns a struct which is not allowed in ABI v1 so the code is clearly wrong and probably will fail at runtime.

The interesting thing is that it apparently was not triggering the ICE. I don't know why and the contract is huge so isolating the cause will take some time. I'm not sure it's worth it.

The question is: do we consider the fix a breaking change in that case?

Ready for review again. Changes are pretty minor:
- Moved changelog entry
- Now looping over parameter types rather than arguments
- Two new tests to test pre-byzantium behavior (`v2_accessing_returned_dynamic_array_without_returndata_support.sol`, `v2_accessing_returned_dynamic_array_with_returndata_support.sol`)
- Two new tests to cover the Colony bug (`v2_v1_v2_modifier_sandwich.sol`, `v2_v1_v1_modifier_sandwich.sol`)

Everything else is the same. I'm currently working on the extra cases I found that are not compiler errors (posted in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8379#issuecomment-704342651) but that's a problem in codegen, not type checker so I'm going to extract it into a separate issue and fix there. The type checker changes here are done so I think we can merge this PR as it is now.

BTW, for `t_ems_compile_ext_colony` to pass we need to merge https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/colonyNetwork/pull/7 first.
