# [\#9836 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9836) `merged`: Add missing check for nested dynamic arrays in abi.encode()/decode() functions in ABIEncoderV1

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-09-17 14:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9836):

Related to #9835.

Nested dynamic arrays passed to `abi.encode()` and `abi.decode()` are not detected as unsupported when not using ABI encoder v2 but the compiler fails down the line on an `UnimplementedError` instead. A proper compilation error is reported only for structs. This PR makes changes this so that they're both handled the same way.

The fix makes `Type::fullEncodingType()` consistent with what `TypeChecker::typeSupportedByOldABIEncoder()` returns for ABI v1.
