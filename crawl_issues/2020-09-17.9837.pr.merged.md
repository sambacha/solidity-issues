# [\#9837 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9837) `merged`: Allow using zero in patterns passed to isoltest --test

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-09-17 15:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9837):

Is there a reason for disallowing zeros or was this just a bug?

After this change a command like
```bash
isoltest --test=syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/044_*
```
no longer results in
```
Invalid test unit filter - can only contain '[a-zA-Z1-9_/*]*: syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/044_*
```
but runs `syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/044_returning_multi_dimensional_arrays_new_abi.sol` instead.

Zeros could e.g. be some special character used in patterns. It does seem unlikely though. I was asking just in case :)
