# [\#9838 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9838) `merged`: Fix wrong name reported for invalid named argument

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-09-17 15:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9838):

The error message was mentioning the wrong argument as invalid if the named arguments were in a different order than the parameters in the declaration. In a way it's similar to #9752 but it's a different piece of code this time.

Also, it was reporting parameter names used in the function declaration instead of argument names used in the call as the message implies.

The PR also moves syntax tests related to named arguments from the huge `nameAndTypeResolution/` directory to one where the other tests related to this are.
