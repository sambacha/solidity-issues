As [discussed on twitter](
https://twitter.com/alexberegszaszi/status/1306681715767865344) auditors are still afraid of the optimiser and currently we only have a [verify brief description hidden within standard json](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/using-the-compiler.html#input-description):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20340/93594968-bedcf980-f9ae-11ea-8237-8cc548fa7180.png)

We should create a section under internals explaining all the libevmasm optimiser steps. Later we should extend it with the libyul steps too.

The yul steps do have some documentation in  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/README.md linked from ~~https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/README.md~~  https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/internals/optimiser.html (which in itself has some explanations of the libevmasm optimiser, but I haven't really read it and checked how good and extensive it is)...
The documentation of the yul steps is probably out-of-date and incomplete by now as well, though...

EDITED: wrong link

I'm solely talking about "the documentation" and not files in the repository ðŸ˜‰

I meant "linked from https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/internals/optimiser.html" ;-).

But yeah - might be good to overhaul that one and not merely link the readme in the repository (which I don't think we've been properly maintaining anyways), but rather to move all of that to "the proper" documentation as well. But it's a good starting point in any case.

Is this task complete now? The Yul optimizer steps are now documented. The libevmasm optimizer also has a more detailed description in [Opcode-Based Optimizer Module](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/optimizer.html#opcode-based-optimizer-module), though I'm not sure if it describes all the steps or just the inliner.

@cameel I'd argue the documentation is still lacking. Ideally it would provide enough context so that people understand those Standard JSON settings.

Ah, so it's specifically about the Standard JSON input docs? Updated the title.

Well not specifically, but that's the easiest way to explain the connection to each step.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
