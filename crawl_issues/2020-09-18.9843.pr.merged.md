# [\#9843 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9843) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Implementing delete struct

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23421619?u=50068b46fd9aafcb2b59c0d93b9eb49692ba9c66&v=4" width="50">[mijovic](https://github.com/mijovic) opened issue at [2020-09-18 12:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9843):

I am sneaking in support for recursive functions in `MultiUseYulFunctionCollector` as it is needed for recursive structs. If there is some better way to solve this, I am willing to change that :)

Depends on #9914

I think #9914 will help activating recursive struct case. So, once it is merged, will do another check for that case.

After merging #9914 I needed to implement conversion from `Struct storage` to `Struct storage` pointer in order to get `recursive_struct_2.sol` passing.
It activated bunch of tests as well :)

I think most of the tests start with copying to storage, and that's one thing we have not implemented yet.

Yeah, I hope so, too.
