# [\#9844 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9844) `closed`: Remove release and zip logic from appveyor config.

Since we removed the release script, the appveyor run fails everywhere...
On the other hand, it will probably be superseded by the CircleCI run anyways, so we can also just disable it altogether (I think @chriseth would need to do that in the github settings, though, right?)

In any case, this PR should fix the test runs for now.

Seems to work.

I would prefer to keep both in parallel for at least one release.

Given https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9848#discussion_r492252625 I'm not sure adding the script back is better than removing running it :-). But both is fine, so if either PR is merged the other can be closed.

Closing since https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9848 was merged instead
