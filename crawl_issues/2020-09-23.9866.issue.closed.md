# [\#9866 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9866) `closed`: String literals should use hex representation if not ASCII in error messages

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-09-23 11:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9866):

```
Error: Explicit type conversion not allowed from "literal_string "4V"" to "bytes2".
  --> unsigned.sol:10:13:
   |
10 |      return bytes2(hex"123456");
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

The `hex"123456"` is displayed as "4V" which corresponds to `0x34 0x56`. The first character is not displayed as it is a control character.

`StringLiteralType::toString` should be changed to display hex string if there are non-ASCII characters in the literal. Perhaps we could also consider changing the "invalid UTF-8 literal" there to also just display as hex string, given the conversion error is displayed elsewhere.
