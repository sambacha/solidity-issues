Maybe we don't need to do this actually, because of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9873

I think this might still make sense, but you have to adjust the code in line 37+ - the circelci logic does not check how long each job takes, so you have to manually distribute the larger ones to their own executors.

Right. I moved the run with only SMTChecker tests to the beginning, so it's the first - and heaviest expected - run.
