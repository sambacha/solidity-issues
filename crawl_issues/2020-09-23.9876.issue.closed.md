# [\#9876 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9876) `closed`: [SMTChecker] User timeout option

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-09-23 20:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9876):

Currently the SMTChecker uses a resource limit per SMT query. `rlimit` was chosen instead of the usual timeout to improve reproducibility in the SMTChecker tests. However, that's not very helpful for users.

We should allow a user configurable timeout for SMT queries.
