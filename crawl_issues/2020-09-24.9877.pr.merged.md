# [\#9877 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9877) `merged`: Fix shadowing/same-name warnings for later declarations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-09-24 03:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9877):

```
function e() {}
contract C {
    function f() pure public { uint e; uint g; uint h; }
    function g() pure public {}
}
function h() {}
```

The old implementation warns about shadowing `e()` only. This PR adds warnings for `g()` and `h()`.

Having to pass `m_deferredDeclarations` all over the place does not look very nice. Furthermore, the container we register the declaration at is already passed to the functions.

Instead of `m_deferredDeclarations`, we could store pointers to child containers in the container and then walk the structure of containers and maybe even make the homonym search a function of the container?

I completely agree, it looks redundant. The issues are that in `DeclarationRegistrationHelper::registerDeclaration`
- `_errorLocation` might differ from `_declaration.location()`,
- `_warnOnShadow` flag needs to bee preserved.

So it seems to me that (deferred) declarations need to be decorated somehow with that information. I could add parameters `_errorLocation` and `_warnOnShadow` to `DeclarationContainer::registerDeclaration`, store them somehow, and at the end walk the container tree. (The order in which we report the shadowing warnings does not  matter, right?)

Yeah, maybe add another structure to DeclarationContainer that contains the error locations and "warn on shadow" flags and so on instead of maintaining another parameter.

Actually - is `warn on shadow` set to false anywhere else except for the point where we re-register `this` and `super`? Maybe that can be simplified?

Needs rebase.

Rebased and added a couple of tests.
