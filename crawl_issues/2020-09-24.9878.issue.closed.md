Consider the following multi source isoltest test case (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9852#discussion_r494154820 for original context)

```
==== Source: s1.sol ====
function f() pure returns (uint) { return 1337; }
function g() pure returns (uint) { return 42; }
==== Source: s2.sol ====
import {f as g} from "s1.sol";
==== Source: s3.sol ====
// imports f()->1337 as g()
import "s2.sol";
// imports f()->1337 as f() and
// g()->42 as g
import {f as f, g as g} from "s1.sol";
contract C {
  function foo() public pure returns (uint) {
    // calls f()->1337 / f()->1337
    return f() / g();
  }
}
// ----
// DeclarationError 1686: (s1.sol:0-49): Function with same name and parameter types defined twice.
```

The declaration error's source location does not point to the source of the problem i.e., the import alias in `s2.sol` `{f as g}`. This issue tracks support for improving the error message accordingly.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
