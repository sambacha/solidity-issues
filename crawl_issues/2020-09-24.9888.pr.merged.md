Does not need compiler support and is breaking because of `using`

We had a design call and it was accepted in #3044, but maybe it was too long ago and people changed their minds.

It's a bit unfortunate that adding any member to any type is always breaking because of the ``using`` thing :-) - but because of it I'd indeed say this *is* breaking (but since 0.8 is soon anyways that's not too bad, is it?)

Please rebase onto breaking.
