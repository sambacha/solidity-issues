Since we are disallowing `address(-1)` it makes sense to implement `type(address).min` and `type(address).max`.

Do you think we really need those? Not sure people actually use that, mostly `address(0)`. If they really need it they can do `address(type(uint160).max)`

I also don't think we should expose that to the language - these are mostly used for range checks and arithmetics.

I'll close it then. It was rather quick to implement anyway.
