This is ready for review.

@mijovic this should be very similar to the previous one you reviewed, with a tiny refactoring on top

Still missing new tests

Updated the code with correct `const`s

Added new tests, ready for review

Overall it looks fine to me, but I think this really needs at least a look from @ekpyron or @mijovic. I pointed out everything that I could find in the included changes but I don't know the SMT codebase well enough to tell if anything important might be missing :)

Looks good, just needs another rebase because of conflicts

- Added the test requested by @cameel 
- Added new assertions for `msg.sig` and `msg.data` now that they are interpreted
- Added Changelog entry

Sure, the test changes are fine. I was going to approve too but the number of modified files in the PR suddenly went up from something like 18 to 42 when I looked at the diff :) A lot of those look like simple tweaks in tests at a glance but there are some others too so I thought I'd better take a proper look at them when I have time tomorrow rather than approve in a hurry today.

Yea unfortunately I had to change A LOT of tests removing assertions because z3 started crashing. I'd say that's fine for now, I already reported the bugs, will probably be fixed in the next version and we can hopefully bring those assertions back.

Sure :-)
These changes are due to Spacer crashing if I am correct. You can check out last commit for reference.

@mijovic There were more. E.g. in `CHC.cpp`, `SymbolicTypes.cpp` or `SymbolicState.cpp`. I suspect it might be some trivial stuff, but unfortunately github does not make it easy to check. I just see whole files I already reviewed as changed. And I'm new to SMT code so fully understanding what is what still takes some effort.

But if nothing stood out as wrong to you then I guess it's all fine. I can confirm that everything I did manage review looks fine but I just didn't want to give a false assurance that I reviewed it all by marking the PR as approved myself :)
