Extracted from #9258.

We want the release binaries added to `solc-bin` to be identical with those on github release page. Since the process of adding them to `solc-bin` is manual right now, we should really have an automated check for that, running on all `solc-bin` PRs.

The easiest way to do so is to just download the binaries from github release page and compare. I already have a script for getting the binaries from both Github and CircleCI: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/35, https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/41. It was originally meant to make it easier for the uploader to get them but we shelved that idea. It can be easily repurposed as a part of the check. I just need to do minor modification and run it inside a github action.

> - Binaries in solc-bin must be the exact same binaries as the ones on the release page.
>     - Maybe we could have the manual update script check that.

> Right now @chriseth wants release binaries to be uploaded manually so it's easy to ensure that they're the same. Just upload the same files to both places :) This would be just a sanity check to ensure you did just that.

> And if we automate publishing releases, I think it would just be a matter of having the same CI job upload both to solc-bin and to the release page

We discussed it on the call today. We decided that the check itself does not make much sense since the binaries on github release page can actually be changed at any time. We might still want to go back to the idea of the script for getting the binaries though. 

We're going to wait until @ekpyron is back to discuss it.

We should discuss if we still want it. The process is still manual but with #12929 the binaries are unlikely to go out of sync, unless someone changes them intentionally. We're also considering automating the process of submitting binaries to solc-bin so a discrepancy would be even less likely (though not impossible).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
