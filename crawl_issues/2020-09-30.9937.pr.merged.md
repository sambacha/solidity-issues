It seems to be working now. The binary has 14MB non-stripped and 11MB stripped.

The binary produced by travis is built inside an alpine docker file and only needs 9.5MB stripped. Is that a problem? Should we also build inside alpine?

Ah, maybe due to Release build.

> Still 11MB

Not sure if that makes a big difference in size but the executable from CircleCI is really static (linked with `-static`, `ldd` says `not a dynamic executable`) while ones from `solc-bin` are just not linked with any dynamic libraries (not linked with `-static`, `ldd` says `statically linked`).

Also, the the size in MB is rounded. The actual difference is closer to 1 MB. Your executable is 11037104 bytes while 0.7.2 from solc-bin is 9887824 bytes.

This is weird. If built via `./scripts/docker_build.sh`:
```
> ldd upload/solc-static-linux 
	statically linked
```
If built via `cmake .. -DSOLC_LINK_STATIC=1  -DUSE_CVC4=OFF -DUSE_Z3=OFF`:
```
> ldd solc
	not a dynamic executable
```

Even though docker_build.sh just uses `RUN cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTESTS=0 -DSOLC_LINK_STATIC=1`

Maybe it's related to the compiler or linker in alpine?

Just for reference, [today's discussion about the `-fPIC` flag on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5f7c95eeb7db72780a28b3fb).

Just for the record: the main difference is probably depending on ``/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`` or not and/or if it's a position independent executable or not.
I'd tend to say depending on that is just fine and a position independent executable is always nice, because it allows the kernel to do address space layout randomization, if it wants. And it's the smaller one anyways.
That being said I think both are fine and between those two modes (plus probably different versions of libstdc++.a and maybe even boost embedded in it, right?) I don't find the size difference particularly surprising.

I dug deep into that today to try to figure out which options actually differ. The differences in flags are actually pretty minor. The `-fcf-protection` flag on Ubuntu seems to be the only one with a noticeable impact, adding about 150 kB. It does not fully account for the size difference between binaries though. I think it's rather due to `glibc` being used on Ubuntu and `musl` being used on Alpine. 

### musl vs glibc
Here's a short test:
```bash
echo "int main() {}" > test.cpp
g++ test.cpp -o test -static
```
- Executable size on Alpine: 46 112 bytes
- Executable size on Ubuntu: 871 568 bytes

Another downside to `glibc` in our use case is that apparently it's not recommended to statically link it. There's a lot of questions about it on SO and blogs but the only more official looking mention is this entry on glibc wiki: [Even statically linked programs need some shared libraries which is not acceptable for me. What can I do?](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/FAQ#Even_statically_linked_programs_need_some_shared_libraries_which_is_not_acceptable_for_me.__What_can_I_do.3F). I don't think we're using NSS in `solc` (though this might change with introduction of LSP?) but if our goal is for it to be completely static, it might be a good idea to stay on `musl` anyway.

### Flag differences
gcc is built with `--enable-default-pie` in both images. It also reports both `-fPIC` and `-fPIE` as enabled when compiling our .cpp files in both cases. So this one does not differ after all.

- On Ubuntu the compiler gets extra flags (shown when running `make VERBOSE=1`):
    - `-imultiarch x86_64-linux-gnu`. On Alpine it does not and it's not built with `--enable-multiarch` so adding it to `CXXFLAGS` causes an error. I don't think it would affect binary size anyway.
    - `-Wformat-security` just enables a warning.
    - `-fasynchronous-unwind-tables`: no change in size when added to `CXXFLAGS` on Alpine.
    - `-fstack-clash-protection`: adds 4096 bytes to executable size on Alpine.
    - `-fcf-protection`: adds 151 552 bytes to executable size on Alpine.
- On the list of enabled options printed by `g++ -Q -v` when compiling our .cpp files, there are only three differences:
    - ``-fstack-clash-protection`` only on Ubuntu
    - ``-mglibc`` only on Ubuntu
    - ``-mmusl`` only on Alpine
- Alpine image has boost 1.72 while Ubuntu has boost 1.71

### More info
I can post full lists of compiler and linker flags if anyone wants to take a look but there's a lot of it and I already listed the differences above so I think it might be too much information already.

The problem with statically linking glibc is mainly that a lot of other "static" libraries are still built against dynamic glibc, so linking any of those will introduce the dependency on dynamic libraries back - be we don't have the problem (well, at least not currently, but if it is a/the problem with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9937#discussion_r506599392, we can just build another version of z3 that doesn't have that problem, since we build it and any other dependencies that might have this problem ourselves anyways).
So all that being said I'd strongly suggest to move away from and not more towards alternative embedded standard C library implementations. It's not like size is really an issue for these builds and glibc is what we test again and which is known to be the more complete implementation (compared to any other one). If for some reason we do want to keep releasing musl libc builds, we really have to start actively testing that IMHO.

The thing is, we've been using an alternative libc implementation in all static Linux builds the whole time. So is it a good idea to change that now?

That only means that we released static builds that had serious testing issues so far. No reason to continue to do so.

Well, ok :) I'm a bit wary that some issue related to statically linked glibc that we didn't think of might show up but I guess we'll soon find out now that it's on CircleCI and tested properly... And we mostly use glibc in development so having it in static builds does seem like a better choice.

So anyway, if we're fine with the switch from musl to glibc and with those few extra flags that gcc on Ubuntu uses then it looks like there's nothing more to do here (apart from maybe linking Z3 statically but that's a separate issue) and it can be merged as is.
