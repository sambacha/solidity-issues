# [\#9958 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9958) `merged`: Fix ICE caused by storage parameters with nested mappings in libraries

Fixes #9957 .

Alternatively we could wait for PR #9746, it fixes the issue too. (So I was puzzled for some time why I cannot reproduce the error locally :).)

The "fixes" link seems to be to a PR.

I think it was meant to fix #9957.

EDIT: And I see that when you type a dot after `#9957` github's editor suggests `#9915` and inserts it when you press enter. I wish I could disable this issue autocompletion. It's getting in the way more than it ever helps.

Yes, corrected, thanks!

Also, I hope the formatting is OK now, I did not reply to each comment.
