# [\#9959 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9959) `merged`: Fix ICE caused by const structs with mappings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-10-06 02:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9959):

Fixes #9951.

The issue was introduced in d41eaeba5686828b85279057f3a7da8be0f9a8f9, PR #9146,
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9146/files#diff-07335c711d9742b9c53a75648c7ad55cL2295-L2298.

Basically, `if + continue` was replaced with `solAssert`, which crashes with constant structs containing mappings:

```
contract C {
    struct S {
        mapping(uint => uint) c;
    }
    S public constant e;
}
```

The comment in the old code claims that the old behavior was intended. I restored it, but not completely sure if it is the right way to go. Skipping struct members looks suspicious :).

Constants can only be value types, so the struct is already an error.

It might be a slightly different thing. We report a non-fatal error `"Constants of non-value type not yet implemented."` in `TypeChecker` already. That implies that one day they might work.

Here we have a nested mapping issue. Maybe `"Constants of non-value type not yet implemented. Besides, constants are located in memory and could not contain nested mappings anyway."` ? Sounds funny enough, but I would not mind to have it.

Another point is just moving the existing non-value-constants-not-implemented check from `TypeChecker` to `ContractLevelChecker` does not sound quite right. I think it belongs rather to `TypeChecker`, and it is nice to have it non-fatal.

@a3d4 type checker does analysis on expression level, the fact that a constant does not have a value type should be detected earlier, probably in the declarationtypechecker.

I moved the check to `DeclarationTypeChecker`. Was not sure if neighbor checks regarding const initialization should belong to `DeclarationTypeChecker` too, so left them in `TypeChecker` for now.

(There are a few failing builds, ~~but they do not seem to be relevant~~. Investigating.)

Looks good, but somehow causes an internal error in a documentation snippet.

The error occurs in `StandardCompiler::compileSolidity(StandardCompiler::InputsAndSettings _inputsAndSettings)` when converting to Json:

```
if (compilerStack.state() >= CompilerStack::State::Parsed && (!compilerStack.hasError() || _inputsAndSettings.parserErrorRecovery))
	
        . . . .

        sourceResult["ast"] = ASTJsonConverter(false, compilerStack.state(), compilerStack.sourceIndices()).toJson(compilerStack.ast(sourceName));
```

due to `solAssert(!(location() != DataLocation::Storage && type->containsNestedMapping()), "");`.

For some reason, `compilerStack.hasError()` returns `false`, although `DeclarationTypeChecker` fails.

3fc486d may fix this.

But there are three more similar `return false;` in `CompilerStack::analyze()` right before the fix (lines 353, 360, 366 (sorry, links do not work)).

Should `m_hasError` be set to `true` always before returning `false` from `CompilerStack::analyze()`?

> Also missing a changelog

Yes, I know :). I plan to do it when all other things are completed, to avoid merge conflicts.

Will rebase and merge.
