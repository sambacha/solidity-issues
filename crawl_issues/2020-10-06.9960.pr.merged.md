# [\#9960 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960) `merged`: StackLimitEvader: Track unreachable variables globally instead of per function.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-10-06 09:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960):

First part of a series of PRs moving towards moving function arguments (I'll do this in very small steps this time ;-)).

Since the Yul sources are disambiguated, i.e. all variables have globally unique names, unreachables can be tracked globally.

This will result in the ``StackToMemoryMover`` walking through functions without unreachable variables (doing nothing), but it simplifies things, especially down the road.
