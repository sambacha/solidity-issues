# [\#9961 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961) `merged`: StackToMemoryMover: encapsulate memory offset tracking into its own class.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-10-06 09:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961):

~~Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960.~~

Subsequently, the ``StackToMemoryMover`` will be split up into multiple steps (rewriting assignments+declarations, rewriting function definitions, rewriting function calls and rewriting identifiers) and will probably internally have to call the expression splitter and joiner between them.
Tracking and assigning memory offsets to variables will be shared among those individual steps and is therefore extracted first.

~~Putting this in draft mode until https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960 is merged.~~
