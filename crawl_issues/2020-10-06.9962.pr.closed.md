~~Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961 (which depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960).~~

As mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961 the ``StackToMemoryMover`` is split up into parts.
Subsequently, an additional pass will rewrite function definitions and function calls. For the latter the expression splitter is needed before, though, and expressions have to be joined again before rewriting identifiers.

~~Putting this in Draft mode until https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961 is merged.~~

I think this split even makes sense if we (as discussed with @chriseth on a call) may not end up running expression splitter and joiner between the parts later.
The ``StackToMemoryMover`` is still easier to read and more robust, if it does one thing at a time in separate steps, do you agree? Also the "FunctionArgumentMover" part (to be added in the next PR) will probably have to be run iteratively to handle functions with more than 32 arguments as well, that's also an argument for keeping things split.

So I think I'll continue on top of this one and just replace https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9973 as discussed with @chriseth.

Maybe not - I'll move it back to draft and will first check how things look without splitting.

Closing this, since I think I'll end up going a different direction in the end.
