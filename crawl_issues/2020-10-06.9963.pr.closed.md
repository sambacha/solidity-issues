# [\#9963 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9963) `closed`: Move for loop conditons and split expressions during StackToMemoryMover (reversing afterwards).

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9962 (which depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961 which depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960).

This one needs some thought.

The reason for doing this, is that in the next step, function definitions will be rewritten (moving arguments/return parameters to memory), which requires rewriting function calls - and that's only possible in split form.

But first of all I'm not sure, if we shouldn't generally run the ExpressionJoiner until it stabilizes instead of only once.

And secondly, we need to make sure that the combination ``ForLoopConditionIntoBody`` + ``ExpressionSplitter`` before and ``ExpressionJoiner`` + ``ForLoopConditionOutOfBody`` after is invariant with respect to stack slot requirements.
- Moving the for loop condition should be fine - whatever is accessible in the condition should be accessible in an if in the beginning of the body and vice versa.
- ``ExpressionSplitter`` and ``ExpressionJoiner`` should not change the stack layout at all, if I'm thinking about them correctly (they just exchange implicit spots on stack with explicitly named slots, i.e. local variables). But maybe good, if someone confirm that that's true.

Nicely, the test expectations are identical, except for higher variable indices.

Putting this into draft mode until https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9962 is merged.

Closing this, since I think I'll end up going a different direction in the end.
