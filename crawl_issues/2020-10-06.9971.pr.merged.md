# [\#9971 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9971) `merged`: Checking experimental pragmas in the right source unit when compiling modifiers and inherited functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-10-06 19:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9971):

Fixes #9969.

~Needs more tests. I haven't really tested it with experimental pragmas other than `ABIEncoderV2`.~
- Done. This does not really affect the SMTChecker pragma because it's not used in the codegen. And those two are the only experimental pragmas we have now (not counting those test pragmas prefixed with `_`).

The PR is ready for review now.

All the included test cases are things that cause an ICE without this fix, except for `v1_modifier_overriding_v2_modifier.sol` which preempts ABIEncoderV2 by overriding the modifier.
