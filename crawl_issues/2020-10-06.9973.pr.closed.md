Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9963 (which depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9962 which depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9961 which depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9960). Also contains a copy of the change in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9972.

This one does the actual deed and moves function parameters/return values to memory, if required.
This is still an *actual* draft and needs some refinement.

For demonstration purposes it has a commit to no longer force-run the full optimiser on the tests. For this to work, the safe-guard against inline assembly has to be removed, though. But, this way all tests pass this way, whereas there's around 20 of them that wouldn't without the full StackLimitEvader.

It also needs proper test cases for functions with more than 16 arguments/return values. It may be that for that to work the arguments have to be moved in a different, specific order (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9973/files#r500583082).

Closing this, since I think I'll end up going a different direction in the end.
