# [\#9976 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9976) `merged`: Dropping AppVeyor CI (as we've moved Windows tests to CircleCI)

This drops AppVeyor CI (basically just removing the appveyor.yml it seems). No other references found.

I think we should make sure AppVeyor is gone from Github CI after merge.

So I guess this means that we're switching to adding `exe`s to `solc-bin` in this release?
