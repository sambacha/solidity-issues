Related to #9931 and #9932.

Just executing the `update` script takes 18 minutes on Travis. In nightly builds on GH actions it's just 13 minutes. Might be even faster in CircleCI but setup might require more work.

I can at least confirm that the checkout of `solc-bin` is faster on CircleCI. Takes about 2 minutes compared to 7 minutes on Github Actions.
