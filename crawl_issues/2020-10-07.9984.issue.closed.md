<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
```
function getBlockTimestamp() external view returns (uint256) {
        return block.timestamp;
}
```
In view functions, the `block.timestamp` is not the same as the real timestamp. It seems it returns the last timestamp which the contract was interacted or executed with non-view functions.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.2
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Ganache
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
```
-->

```
function getBlockTimestamp() external view returns (uint256) {
        return block.timestamp;
}
```

Thanks in advance,

That's correct behavior. `block.timestamp` is the timestamp of the most recent block. On the actual blockchain the timestamp would be changing simply because there are new blocks being mined all the time but if you're checking it in a test environment running ganache, you're just seeing the timestamp from the last time you did something that involved creating a new transaction and adding a block. Calling a view function does not involve creating a transaction so there's no new block in that case.

Thanks for your explanation. That fully makes sense.

Then for unit testing on a test environment, how can we handle this?
It seems that there is no solution, right?

You can use `evm_increaseTime` from Ganache for testing.

See for example https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/67593/as-in-truffle-tests-pass-the-check-by-block-timestamp
