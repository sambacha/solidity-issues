There should be an issue about this problem: Do we want to make use of the knowledge that in the current storage layout, some parts of a slot are completely unused?

One reason why we did not make use of that knowledge yet is because of upgrades: Someone might want to add or remove items at the end of a struct. If this is an issue here has to be discussed, but I would prefer not to just merge this without a decision on that subject. 

I think we even discussed that in the past and concluded that the gas savings are not worth the trouble.

I'm aware of that discussion, but I don't think that's exactly the same - this here is really only about deleting the struct, so the situation is slightly different, isn't it? Here I'd argue we actually *should* delete the whole slot, particularly with an eye of upgrades...

I.e. if I extend ``struct S { uint8 a; }`` to ``struct S { uint8 a; uint8 b; }`` - is it then sane behavior that deleting the struct might ever *not* delete ``b``?

You're referring to this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7891, right? Where we decided against it in the end?

@chriseth I added few tests that show where this is different to the old codegen. There are 3 different tests, and all of them fail with old codegen.
