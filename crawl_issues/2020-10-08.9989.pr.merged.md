Can you check if we have the same problem with parameters?

I checked and they don't have the same problem

For normal parameters it seems they are only inherited if they match exactly.

What is blocking this?

`existingTags` was no longer needed when I changed to use iterators with the `upper_bound()` function.

Before we had one loop over a multimap. `return` tags for example could have multiple values. `existingTags` was there to make sure we don't copy the already existing ones and we couldn't just check the target map if the tag already exists because due to the multi map we need to add the same tag with different values (e.g. multiple `return`s)

I rewrote it a bit to not use `it->first` and `it->second` much.. I could rewrite it without iterators I suppose but then I'd need to use `equal_range()` at the very least and it will also be not be much easier I fear..
