The following code compiles without error but it seems to me that the compiler should throw an error because the generated runtime code does not work:
```Solidity
   function test() external pure returns (uint256[] memory _myArray) {
        _myArray[0] = 10;
        _myArray[1] = 12;
    }
````

It seems to me that it should be a compile error to assign a value to an item in an uninitialized memory array, because it doesn't work at runtime.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
