# [\#10007 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10007) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Try to solve the deposit contract loop

The `assert(false)` in https://github.com/axic/eth2-deposit-contract/blob/master/deposit_contract.sol#L158 should be unreachable. It is currently not solvable with the SMTChecker.

I wrote a direct CHC version of it in https://gist.github.com/leonardoalt/d9a000dc03fd7cba90e4bcf472549d79, but z3/Spacer is unable to solve it.

We could try to solve it first directly as CHC before trying to solve it with the SMTChecker.

@GeorgeSheridan no.

As explained in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9806, we can't really expect to solve the loop, aka proving that `assert(false)` is not reachable, due to it needing a nonlinear inductive invariant which we can't expect to be found.
