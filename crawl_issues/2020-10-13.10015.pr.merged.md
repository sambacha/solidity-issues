Well, I was hoping this would stay smaller, and I was hoping that I wouldn't have to leave this open while I'm off, but what can one do.

It is worth a look, it does work, but there will be some minor changes required, I'm sure (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10015#discussion_r506639957 probably for example). Not sure if anyone wants to take it up while I'm gone - if so, then please be careful with it ;-P.

Because I happened to read that @mijovic wants to test compiling the gnosis safe on this branch: note that all of this is currently disabled entirely - to actually have ir codegen run this, the memoryguards have to be added back.

I.e. #10047 needs to be reverted for that.

For the record: I think all three of those involve recursions preventing the stack limit evasion.

I missed that one, I'll have a look now!

Fixed in the commit "Fix argument stack slot reuse for functions without return variables.". The code transform missed to properly pop arguments on last use for functions that didn't have return variables (I thought this would never happen, because there'd always be at least one return variable left, but that's of course not the case, if the function doesn't have any return variables from the start).

> Is it okay to perform this for code with msize?

I'd say: In general, the stack limit evader is only ok, if you write code that conforms to our memory invariants - I'd say that includes the use of ``msize``. In theory, there can both be uses of `msize` compatible with this and incompatible with this. Adding `memoryguard` to your custom yul code means you understand what it means and respect the memory model, including using `msize` accordingly. For sol->yul in the first version there won't be any `msize`, since it will not be run in the presence of inline assembly blocks at all; in the future annotation the assembly block as "memory-safe" (or whatever) will extend to promising its usage of `msize` is fine.

> About memorygaurds having different literal value, can we check for that in the analysis phase and throw an error?

In theory, it's perfectly fine and semantically well-defined to have different code paths with different literal values of `memoryguard`, so I'd just make running this step contingent on it having the same value everywhere...
One could think about, whether we should check that ``memoryguard`` is called before any memory operation, resp. not called twice in the same control flow path...
