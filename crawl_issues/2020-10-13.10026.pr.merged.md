# [\#10026 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10026) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix counterexample state reporting

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-10-13 21:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10026):

Missed that in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10014.

Without this PR, the counterexamples are reported wrong:

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract D {
    uint x = 0;
    uint y = x - 1;
}  
```

```
Warning: CHC: Underflow (resulting value less than 0) happens here.
 --> a.sol:4:11:
  |
4 | 	uint y = x - 1;
  | 	         ^^^^^
Note: 
Counterexample:
x = (state_type ((as const (Array Int Int)) 0)), y = 0

Transaction trace:
constructor()
```
Since the index is wrong, it's reporting the balances as the wanted state variable.

With the PR it goes back to normal:
```
Warning: CHC: Underflow (resulting value less than 0) happens here.
 --> a.sol:4:11:
  |
4 | 	uint y = x - 1;
  | 	         ^^^^^
Note: 
Counterexample:
x = 0, y = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935

Transaction trace:
constructor()
```
