# [\#10027 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10027) `merged`: Continued Yul syntax test extractions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2020-10-14 10:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10027):

There are now only 2 tests left in `test/libyul/Parser.cpp` that are not really syntax tests, but one an analysis test and the other one is testing default type assignment.

I wonder if it is possible to extract them.

p.s.: There's one dead macro in this file now (`CHECK_ERROR(text, typ, substr)`). I wonder if that one can be removed?

I also split the extractions into topic commits, for easier review.
