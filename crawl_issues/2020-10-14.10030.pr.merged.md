Is the problem that we do not recurse into `_contract.annotation().contractDependencies`? Would computing the transitive closure on that graph as a first step help?

In way yes that's the problem. The function `compileContract` and `generateIR` didn't check the dependencies for abstract contracts and instead returned early. I don't know if what you described would help.. It seems to me my fix is a simple solution to the problem..

ah, you mean recursing.. yeah that would help I think

Yeah, I also thought about it - making ``contractDependencies`` recursive (or computing the transitive closure from it) would also solve this issue and we would get rid of passing these maps around as function arguments.
DFS on it should do it...

I would merge this in any case, we can still make it better.. I can create an extra issue for that...

Looks good, but please add a test that shows that only the IRs of contracts that are really needed are included. Maybe something like
```
contract A {}
contract B {}
contract C {
  constructor() { new B(); }
}
contract D {}
```

and check that the runtime code of `C` does not contain any other contracts and that only `B` is included in the creation code.

Apart from the changelog wording it looks good!

Does it fully fix the cited issue?

Yes, that and more.
