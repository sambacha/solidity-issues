# [\#10031 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10031) `merged`: Add another argument to setimmutable and the AssignImmutable opcode, allowing to modify code at any memory offset.

Pushing this as draft now for discussion.
It intentionally doesn't have a Changelog entry yet, since we may decide targetting ``breaking`` with it in the end. EDIT: just rebased and changed the base branch to breaking to have CI run tests there as well.

It's rather annoying that we probably have to consider this breaking...
I would see one way to avoid that, which would be to make the code offset the last argument of ``setimmutable``/``ASSIGNIMMUTABLE`` instead (i.e. the one deepest in the stack), and specify that it's not popped by it...

Then the current ``PUSH immutableValue ASSIGNIMMUTABLE`` would change to ``PUSH 0 PUSH immutableValue ASSIGNIMMUTABLE POP`` which would work before and after the change...

But that'd be extremely hacky...

Rebased.

I *really* don't understand how this can fail tests depending on the *platform*....
EDIT: now I saw it, my bad.

> setimmutable documentation change is missing

Oh, damn, right, definitely.

Changed the documentation and rephrased it slightly...
I thought about rephrasing it even more and being more precise about the opcode assuming that there is exactly one subobject which contains the ``loadimmutable`` calls and that "the runtime code of the contract" refers to the code of that subobject and so on...
But then left it similar to what we had, let me know if you think, we should be more precise.
