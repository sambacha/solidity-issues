What about standard json?

Right. Standard JSON. And then it needs to be added to the docs for standard JSON input.

Also, having two command-line tests to make sure it actually works (one for standard JSON and one for normal command-line) might be a good idea.

I was mainly wondering, though - standard json can be a separate PR (depending on what's the plan there).

Could be but I found it frustrating at times that some options are only in one or the other. Whether here or in a separate PR, I think it's a good idea to have all newly added options in both.

Yeah, the other PR should definitely go into the same release :-).
By the way: in general standard-json is more feature rich, so usually that'd be the first place to implement it and then have the CLI follow (if both is not done at once).
But yeah, I'm not sure what @leonardoalt's plan was for that here :-).

I was hoping no one would remember standard json and we could go without :p
I planned on adding it later, mostly because the people that need this feature right now use the compiler via CLI. But I can also do it in this PR.

- Added model checker engine strings instead of hardcoded strings
- Added standard json option
- Added tests

Ready for review.

@ekpyron Actually after this we can have CHC only counterexample tests as well

This is annoying though. Not sure I can get rid of those trailing whitespaces that easily

Looks pretty easy to me...
CHC.cpp:L1407 for example - just don't output the space if ``formatVariableModel(*stateVars, stateValues, ", ")`` is empty or starts with a linebreak. Quite similar for the others probably.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) commented at [2020-10-16 10:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10036#issuecomment-709974104):

That one is easy. But for example
```
Note:<whitespace>
Counterexample:
```
I don't want `Counterexample` to be in front of `Note:`, but `Note:` always adds a whitespace anyway, so the only solution here, without changing the internals too much, is to indeed add `Note: Counterexample:` which to me looks ugly

Just change liblangutil/SourceReferenceFormatterHuman.cpp:L168 and have it only add the space if ``secondary.message`` is nonempty (or doesn't start with a newline, if that's also necessary, but probably it isn't)...
That's where it's coming from, right?

Or that. (putting an empty secondary location there to achieve a newline - that's what it did, wasn't it? - seems a bit abusive anyways)

Apparently the compiler prints a message to stderr when there's no output :)

```c++
	if (!g_hasOutput)
	{
		if (m_args.count(g_argOutputDir))
			sout() << "Compiler run successful. Artifact(s) can be found in directory " << m_args.at(g_argOutputDir).as<string>() << "." << endl;

			serr() << "Compiler run successful, no output requested." << endl;
	}

I wonder why the script is not complaining locally though

For me it outputs this locally:

```json
{"errors":[{"component":"general","errorCode":"3805","formattedMessage":"Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.\n","message":"This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.","severity":"warning","type":"Warning"}],"sources":{"A":{"id":0}}}
```

But if the pre-release warning is the problem here then other tests should be failing too...

Oh, I see that the pre-release warning gets stripped by the test script. The stderr message does not.

```bash

It's a command line test though, not a standard json. When I run via the cli, I also get the prerelase warning. But CI fails saying the message "Compiler run successful, no output requested."

But it's the same for non-json tests. The `else` part removes the warning in that case but still does not remove that message from stderr. And it's on stderr only in release builds.

You could change the script to strip it but I think that a simpler workaround would be just to add something to your test input to cause an unrelated warnings. This way there's always some output.

@cameel I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing. The test fails on CI because of this expectation mismatch:
```
- model_checker_engine_none/

It's not about the prerelease warning, it's about `no output requested`.

We're talking about the same thing :) Whether `no output requested` is there or not depends on the presence of the pre-release warning.
- In CI it's probably a force release build so there's no warning and stderr contains `no output requested`. Test fails.
- Locally it's a pre-release build. Stderr contains the pre-release warning. But the script strips that warning and stderr becomes empty. Test succeeds.

Is it? I don't see `model_checker_engine_none/err` in the diff.
