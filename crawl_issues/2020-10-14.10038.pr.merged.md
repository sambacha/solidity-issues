# [\#10038 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10038) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Encoding div and mod operations with slack variables

Resolves #9197

In order to enable CHC engine on programs with modulo and division operators, the SMT encoding cannot use the corresponding SMT-LIB operators. Instead, we encode the semantics using additional, slack, variables.

@leonardoalt Can you check the encoding for the division, if you spot any problem? In the meantime, I will try to do something similar for modulo.

The `chk_errorcodes` check is failing because now the error `1218 CHC: Error trying to invoke SMT solver doesn't happen anymore`, which is good. We should keep the error of course, so we need to add 1218 to the list of non tested errors.
@blishko in `scripts/error_codes.py` there is a block with the numbers of untested errors. Can you add 1218 there?
