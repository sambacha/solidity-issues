A cache per branch really doesn't help much. Arguably also ``{{ checksum ".circleci/config.yml" }}`` could be removed as well, but I kept it for now. What's really cached is the result of ``.circleci/osx_install_dependencies.sh``, so that checksum would be enough...

I'd actually rather argue that this one here *shouldn't* depend on the hash of ``.circleci/config.yml`` :-).
All the dependency management should be in the scripts. They are the things that change, if the cache should change.
And if we want to change that, we can manually change the cache key when editing ``.circleci/config.yml``...
But I guess one can argue both ways - we should probably indeed do the same for both builds, though, otherwise it'll get confusing :-).

But for example now while I'm changing ``.circleci/config.yml`` again and again until I have a working bytecode comparison setup, it'd drive me mad, if for any completely unrelated change in it, the already slow ``b_win`` would need to start rebuilding its cache for no reason ;-).

Ok, you have a point. My argument was that you could add stuff directly in `config.yml` and install more dependencies without modifying the install script. But if we are committed to keeping it all in the script then yeah, skipping the config does save us some rebuilds. I also thought that rebuilding it on config changes is not a big deal but I forgot about debugging :)

In that case maybe remove it from the OS X key? Whichever we choose, I think those keys should be consistent.

What about removing it everywhere and putting a comment in the circleci config :-)?

Something like this maybe?
