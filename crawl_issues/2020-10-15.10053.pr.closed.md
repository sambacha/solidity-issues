Am I missing something here or do we just have loads of library related bugs?
Here we even had a test for allowing this... but why? The only thing one could do would be
```
library L {}
contract C { function f() public returns (address) { return address(new L()); } }
```
...
That actually compiles and runs in remix returning... some address... but it's not supposed to is it, that's not a proper way to deploy a library, is it :-)?
