Needed an exception for allowing ``using L`` and I made a special case for inheriting from libraries to retain a nicer error message.
Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10052 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10053.
Suggestions for better error messages than "Invalid use of library name." welcome.
