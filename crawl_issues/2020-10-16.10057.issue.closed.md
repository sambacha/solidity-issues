# [\#10057 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10057) `closed`: Making the stack limit evader viable

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-10-16 17:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10057):

Probably our quickest path to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9351

The problem is that parts of our code violate the ``memoryguard`` assumption (recall ``let ptr := memoryguard(<staticMemorySize>)`` is a promise to the optimizer to only use memory between zero and ``<staticMemorySize>``, or above ``ptr``). In particular ``IRGenerator::deployCode`` copies the runtime code to memory offset 0 and ``setimmutable`` on develop depends on that (on breaking it takes the offset as an additional argument already, but still doesn't allocate memory, but hardcodes 0 for now). And multiple code paths that revert write the revert message to offset 0.

The problem is that in the unlikely case that the optimizer changes those code paths in such a way that memory variables will be required in them, the StackLimitEvader relies on the ``memoryguard`` assumption, so we need to make sure we always obey it, even in reverting paths.

What we need for that is "memory objects lite", i.e. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5107#issuecomment-638890232
That is we have to:
- define the memory management functions (``mobj_allocate`` and friends) described in that comment as step 1 as Yul util functions. Implementations just use the free memory pointer.
- also define the memory read and write functions of step 2 in that comment, as well as versions of all builtins that write to memory (e.g. ``keccak256_mobj`` - precise naming scheme to be decided).
  - To be decided: will memory objects store their size and assert on overread/write? How so? If so will there be "splicing"?
- @chriseth may disagree and suggest a different path from this on, but I'd say once the above is done, all those defined Yul functions should become builtins in a new yul dialect, while the regular ``mstore`` et al functions will be removed from this dialect. The definitions of them as Yul Util Functions will move to a translation phase from this dialect to the "low-level" dialect using plain mstores.
- After this all code generated from this dialect can be considered stack limit evader safe.
 - To be decided: what about plain mload's in assembly? If they occur and are translated to actual low-level mloads those will probably still have to be in the dialect and during the translation of the other memory builtins to the low-level dialect we have to check if any of them are seen - if yes: disable stack limit evader (emit no ``memoryguard``), otherwise: enable it (emit ``memoryguard``)
- At this point depending on the state of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10015 merely adding back the memory guards in ``IRGenerator::memoryInit`` should enable the stack limit evader whenever required and - if it actually works - we can compile https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9351

I'm calling this done.
