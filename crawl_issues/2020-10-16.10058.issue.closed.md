## Description

This contract:
```solidity
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
	struct S {
		int[] b;
	}
	S s;
	struct T {
		S s;
	}
	T t;
	function f() public {
		s.b.push()=
		t.s.b.push();
	}
}
```

produces:

```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/home/user/solidity/libsolidity/formal/SMTEncoder.cpp(1783): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::SMTEncoder::assignment(const solidity::frontend::Expression &, const smtutil::Expression &, const solidity::frontend::TypePointer &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: 
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = 
```

when compiled with solc.

On master, using AFL fuzzing.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer.

We've seen ICEs in this code before (#9901 is notably similar, but I just checked and it is still fixed), probably just another corner case of this general pattern.

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.7.4-develop.2020.10.16+commit.eedd12ad.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

Thanks for he report!

#9901 wasn't really fixed yet. It was just closed because the problem seems to be the same as in #9743.

And I think this one is the same thing unfortunately. The same assertion fails in all three cases and I think the common element is the assignment to `push()`.

I managed to reduce it to this:
```solidity
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
    uint[] b;

    function f() public {
        b.push() = 1;
    }
}
```

Hmm, I could have sworn in latest build #9901 does not produce an ICE!

Must have been something else. Admittedly, I only tried 0.7.3 release when I commented so now I recompiled on `develop` just to be sure and I can confirm that #9901 still makes the compiler barf :)
