# [\#10062 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10062) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Verify the Circles UBI contract
**Labels**: `medium effort`, `smt`

Let's try to verify it. Made a fork which has the Zeppelin code without imports and SMT enabled here: https://github.com/axic/circles-contracts/tree/smt

- [x] Bug with private fields in multiple files (fixed by #10139)
- [x] Contract types #10141
- [x] Track simple branches better #10142
- [x] Bug with BMC #10144
- [x] Bug with variables touched by `assembly` https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10619

Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10596 to support some inline assembly.
We can't really support `call` besides the invariants in the presence of reentrancy, which we already have. I recently noticed that `call` isn't supported in that case, but it should. Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10576 to track that.
In any case, I think implementing those is not necessary for this issue.
@axic can we close this then?

There's also the `Hub.sol` file, which had more issues. It uses `Token.sol` so it was a good first step.

I think the results from `Hub.sol` are ok though.

`seen` here refers to `address[] public seen;` so while technically it could have `2**256-1` elements, it is not practically possible. We really need assertion annotations :)

For `a.push()`, we already add that the resulting length is `< uint.max - 1`, so that you can always push again without overflowing, since that would also not be practically possible (push overflow would also require 2**256 -1 operations). I'd say that similarly, we can add `length < uint.max - 1` for any `.length` access, so that it wouldn't overflow here as well.

Running current develop on `Hub.sol` gives a huge amount of `underflow/overflow/div by 0 might happen here`. It would be good to try to understand why that is.

My guess is again `pow` and the other nonlinear stuff making termination analysis fail and therefore non of the other inductive stuff works.

What draws my attention are warnings on out of bounds access when the loop is:
`for (uint i = 0; i < seen.length; i++)` and  `i` is used as access index. I think Leo is right on this problem: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10062#issuecomment-745551790

I am not sure why `Condition is always false` warning is printed. Context where it's printed is:
```
        address src;
        address dest;
        // iterate through the array of all the addresses that were part of the transaction data
        for (uint i = 0; i < seen.length; i++) {
            transferValidator memory curr = validation[seen[i]];
            // if the address sent more than they received, they are the sender
            if (curr.sent > curr.received) {
                // if we've already found a sender, transaction is invalid
                require(src == address(0), "Path sends from more than one src");
                // the real token sender must also be the transaction sender
                require(seen[i] == msg.sender, "Path doesn't send from transaction sender");
                src = seen[i];
            }
            // if the address received more than they sent, they are the recipient
            if (curr.received > curr.sent) {
                // if we've already found a recipient, transaction is invalid
                require(dest == address(0), "Path sends to more than one dest");
                dest = seen[i];
            }
        }
        // a valid path has both a sender and a recipient
        require(src != address(0), "Transaction must have a src");
```
We have a loop followed by a require statement on a variable `src` which is assigned inside the loop.
With the default loop iterations settings the loop is visited once and I think we shouldn't see this warning.
I'll add a test to our checker to figure out why that happens. @leonardoalt

After solving this issue: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14449 the output for `Hub.sol`, when checked with the default `--model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations` setting has changed and now the following warning is reported:
```
Warning: BMC: Condition is always false.
   --> Hub.sol:298:17:
    |
298 |         require(dest != address(0), "Transaction must have a dest");
```
which I think is fine given that the loop in `Hub.sol` is:
```
address src;
address dest;
for (uint i = 0; i < seen.length; i++) {
            transferValidator memory curr = validation[seen[i]];
            // if the address sent more than they received, they are the sender
            if (curr.sent > curr.received) {
                // if we've already found a sender, transaction is invalid
                require(src == address(0), "Path sends from more than one src");
                // the real token sender must also be the transaction sender
                require(seen[i] == msg.sender, "Path doesn't send from transaction sender");
                src = seen[i];
            }
            // if the address received more than they sent, they are the recipient
            if (curr.received > curr.sent) {
                // if we've already found a recipient, transaction is invalid
                require(dest == address(0), "Path sends to more than one dest");
                dest = seen[i];
            }
        }
```
basically if for 1 loop iteration `src` is non-zero address, `dest` is a zero address
