Can you add a test that shows that this is not part of the metadata?

@chriseth How do I do that

@chriseth add a commit with the requested info

What was the reason behind moving it out? In fact I think it made more sense under `settings`, given every other setting is grouped there.

Metadata

I was just wondering the same as @axic, while thinking about https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9583#issuecomment-737102636, for which this change makes things a lot less nice...
And as for the metadata argument: ``outputSelection`` is just as well part of ``settings`` and will never end up in the metadata, so there is in no way a real direct correspondence between standard-json input ``settings`` and metadata ``settings``.

In fact, I'd really vote for reverting this change before it becomes set in stone due to being released for too long of a time - 0.8 would be a good chance.

Looking at the timing of this change, to me this seems a bit like a last-minute pre-release panic-change that wasn't entirely thought through and I don't think we should let it dictate the standard-json interface for all eternity ;-).

One alternative would be to radically move in the other direction and deprecate all standard-json ``settings`` that won't end up as they are in the metadata (like ~~``settings.metadata``,~~ ``settings.stopAfter``, ``settings.outputSelection``) as well as ``modelCheckerSettings`` and move all of them to a new top-level key called ``options``.

Yes, it was a pre-release hot fix move. I agree with your points though, but I think I prefer the outer `options` idea.

I'm not sure why there is a need for `settings` to match the metadata, and what is the difference between `settings` and `options`, intuitively without knowing about the metadata.

Yeah... ``options`` are optional stuff that doesn't affect the "relevant, fixed" output, i.e. bytecode - and ``settings`` are setting fixed stuff that is then set in stone in bytecode ;-)... but yeah, it's a stretch and maybe it's not that good of an idea after all and we should just move ``modelCheckerSettings`` back to ``settings``...

Please create an issue about it and schedule it into the project.

I only just saw this... was this done in a breaking fashion?  Will `modelCheckerSettings` no longer work?  Could it be possible for both to work (with I guess the preferred one overriding the other one)?

Just for the record: Yes, it can be considered breaking, but it is an interface change and the feature was only introduced one release ago, so our recommendation would be to just not support the old location of the setting at all.

Yeah, I realized after writing this that actually we can just foist this problem off on our own users, so I don't think it's really a problem after all.  Thanks!
