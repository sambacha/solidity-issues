# [\#10068 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10068) `merged`: Refactor SMT cex graph

Currently the cex graph builder in Z3CHCInterface uses strings directly from the model. This is not ideal since we'd need to parse smtlib2 to report counterexamples for arrays and structs, for example.
This PR then:
- Changes the cex graph builder to use `smtutil::Expression` instead of direct strings, which requires a translator back from `z3::expr` to `smtutil::Expression`. The translator doesn't need to be as complete as `Z3Interface::toZ3Expr`, it only needs to support the expressions that are used by z3/Spacer to described the counterexamples.
- Adds a function that formats `smtutil::Expression` nicely, based on the Solidity type. Since this is a refactoring PR, the result should be the same as before: only value types are reported. But the Solidity type is needed to decode certain SMT expressions, such as tuples.
