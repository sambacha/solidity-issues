# [\#10074 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10074) `merged`: Add unknown message to all verification targets

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-10-19 17:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10074):

CHC used to rely on BMC to report the "might happen here" messages when it couldn't solve a query. Now that the engine can be chosen, if only CHC runs, it doesn't report "might happen here" when the solver errors (rlimit exceeded) or answers unknown.

This PR adds reporting for all verification targets to make sure that CHC reports when it can't solve something.
