# [\#10078 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10078) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Enable division by zero checks in CHC engine

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-10-20 07:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10078):

This is an initial work on enabling division by zero checks in the CHC engine.
However, there are still some problems to solve. Mainly, now there can be multiple verification targets for the same ASTNode, for example Overflow and DivisionByZero for signed division. This needs to be synchronized with the errorIDs corresponding to the ASTNode.

@blishko when fixing the comments above, it could make sense to squash the commits into a single one already
