Can you add more tests, in particular:
- Replacing byte array with a shorter one and checking if storage is cleared properly, both for short and long byte arrays
- Same with replacing long byte array (>=32 elements) with short byte array
- Copying of a struct containing bytes array

Actually, after one more look, I think it would be easier and better to reuse `resizeDynamicByteArrayFunction` just after extracting `newLen`. Just like @hrkrshnn suggested. Than you just need to copy elements to storage. What do you think? @chriseth

@mijovic but that would mean additional sstore operations because data needs to be copied over. Shouldn't we avoid them?

Yes, there are certain cases when `sstore`s are wasted, so, leaving like this is better option.

Looks good now. I think it has good test coverage now.
I would just squash some commits, which you probably already have planned to do.
