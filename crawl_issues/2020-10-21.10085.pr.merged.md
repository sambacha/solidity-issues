# [\#10085 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10085) `merged`: Extracting inline assembly syntax tests.

Fixes #6205.

Commits split into semantic groups for better reviewing.

Also, I've added an initial tiny commit to update the project root's `.editorconfig` to something that I believe is the common denominator amongst all `.sol` files (indentation level and using spaces instead of tabs).

The file is called "inlineAssembly", but these are actually yul parser tests. Can you move them please?

Please remove some of the error code exceptions from error_codes.py.

~~I'm not sure how this related to the PR, or what am I overlooking? I was running `error_codes.py --check` to find potential errors (none found). What exactly did you think of?~~

Added a new commit at the end to do that.

There are still some tests that use inline assembly.
