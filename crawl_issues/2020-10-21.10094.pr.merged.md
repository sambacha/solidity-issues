# [\#10094 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10094) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Added support for selector when expression's value is known at compile time

Resolves #10021 , although using selector on variables of FunctionType is still not supported (the value of the selector for such expressions is not known at compile time).

@leonardoalt Can you review this?

I will add more tests. There already is a test where selector is used on a argument of a function of type FunctionType: `types/function_type_members.sol`
But I can add more.

Ah ok. Maybe just add a few more also with the actual value of the selector.

Sorry, what do you mean by "actual value" of the selector? Do you mean that I should compute the actual number for some function signature and assert that it will be that?

@blishko `solc --hashes` gives you that

@leonardoalt I have added some additional tests, do we need more?
