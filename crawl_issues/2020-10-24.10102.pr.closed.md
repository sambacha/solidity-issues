I'm not completely sure if this is how we can fix issue #10011 ,but the changes does make the ICE go away. The type of access made is member access.

@cakesoft-omkar thanks for the contribution, but we'd rather have the example work instead of reporting "unsupported".

The mentioned issue has recently been fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10111, so I'm closing this PR.
