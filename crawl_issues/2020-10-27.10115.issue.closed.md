# [\#10115 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10115) `closed`: [Sol->Yul] Strings in public storage variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-10-27 14:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10115):

Originally reported as a bug in #10100. IR generator is still experimental so it looks more like a missing feature though.

Currently using `string` storage variables with `public` visibility crashes the IR generator. As a consequence, wasm generation for such code does not work either.

This applies to `string` and `bytes` storage variables as well as mappings, structs and arrays that contain them.

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
contract C {
    string public s;
}
```

```bash
solc --ir test.sol
```
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/YulUtilFunctions.cpp(1968): Throw in function std::string solidity::frontend::YulUtilFunctions::readFromStorageDynamic(const solidity::frontend::Type&, bool)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what:
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] =
```

## Environment
- Compiler version: 0.7.4+commit.3f05b770.Linux.g++
