**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `codegen error`, `wasm`

Originally reported in #10100 which has more code examples.

Trying to generate wasm code for a contract that contains a fallback function results in an assertion failing due to the output being incomplete. Apparently the `stop()` function is missing.

## Steps to reproduce
```solidity
contract C {
    fallback() external {}
}
```

```bash
solc --ewasm test.sol
```

```
Exception during compilation: /solidity/libyul/backends/wasm/EVMToEwasmTranslator.cpp(1261): Throw in function solidity::yul::Object solidity::yul::EVMToEwasmTranslator::run(const solidity::yul::Object&)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Invalid code generated after EVM to wasm translation.
Note that the source locations in the errors below will reference the original, not the translated code.
Translated code:

```

## Environment
- Compiler version: 0.7.4+commit.3f05b770.Linux.g++

Need to add `stop` to the `EVMToEwasmTranslator`.
