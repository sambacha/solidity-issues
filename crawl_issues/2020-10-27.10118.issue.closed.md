# [\#10118 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10118) `closed`: [Sol->Yul] Initializing string storage variables

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-10-27 14:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10118):

Originally reported as a bug in #10100. IR generator is still experimental so it looks more like a missing feature though.

An attempt to initialize a `string` or `bytes` storage variable crashes the IR generator. As a consequence, wasm generation for such code does not work either.

This looks similar to #10115 but the crash happens in a different function and affects non-public storage variables too.

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
contract C {
    string s = "abcd";
    bytes b = "abcd";
}
```

```bash
solc --ir test.sol
```
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/YulUtilFunctions.cpp(2121): Throw in function solidity::frontend::YulUtilFunctions::updateStorageValueFunction(const solidity::frontend::Type&, const solidity::frontend::Type&, const std::optional<unsigned int>&)::<lambda()>
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>

```

## Environment
- Compiler version: 0.7.4+commit.3f05b770.Linux.g++
