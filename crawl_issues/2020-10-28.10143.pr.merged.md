Can you add some tests that
 - contain multiple functions, potentially recursively calling each other
 - use virtual function calls
?

It might be cleaner to not recurse into functions right away, but maybe not.

The last two tests use virtual function calls, no?

@chriseth Unfortunately I couldn't think of a good solution to avoid duplicate errors easily. Open to suggestions. As an example, this contract here

```
contract A {
  uint x;
  function f() internal virtual {
  }
  function t() public returns(uint256) {
    f();
  }
}

contract B is A {
  function f() internal override {
    revert();
  }
}
contract C is A {
  function f() internal virtual override {
  }
}

contract D is C {
  function f() internal override {
  }
}

contract E is D {

}
```

Produces

```

To my understanding all warnings but the one for `E` are not really duplicates as they "change" something

@marenz do you think it might make sense to silence all other warnings if they are about the same variable? Even if the call graph might be different?

I think that makes sense.. basically just showing the first warning for each variable.. and if the user fixes it and there are more they will see it in the next compilation attempt..

That seems so vague I am not sure it would be helpful?

These doubly-recursive calls look a bit complicated to me. Do you think the following strategy could be simpler:
 - do a first pass and just collect which functions call which and store it in reverse order
 - then analyze the flows of each function to see if they revert or not, taking the properties of the other functions into account.
 - whenever there is a change in the reverting behaviour of function f, note all functions calling f to be re-analyzed
 - do this until the list of functions to be re-analyzed is empty.

This PR is ready for review (again). It now uses the approach chris outlined at the cost of not having detection of recursion loops.

This looks almost ready to be merged. Can you add some more tests that use multiple files and some tests that use complicated control flow and multiple levels of function calls?
something like
```
function f(uint x) {
  if (x) g();
  else h();
}
function g() { h(); }
function h() { revert(); }
```

@marenz did you compare compilation times? I think it increases the compilation times of our external tests by 4%. Is that acceptable? If it is 4% of a compilation that includes the optimizer, I fear it is too much.

I did some comparisons, but I am not sure how accurate they are. I looked only at the last step of the tests the "external <name> test" but even then there is online interaction involved, adding a rather large factor into the timings of those tests..

```

3:05   3:28 gnosis 2:58
       3:12 gnosis-v2 3:15

I'm especially concerned about zeppelin. Can you try compiling zeppelin locally with the native binary?

Here are the results of compiling zepplin. Numbers are seconds. I ran 5 tests for each binary.
```
Mine: 14.201, 14.224, 14.147, 14.128, 14.268 ~= 14.1936s
deve: 13.729, 13.801, 13.724, 13.779, 13.679 ~= 13.7424s
```
That would be about 3.28% slower.
