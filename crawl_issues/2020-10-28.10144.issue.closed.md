# [\#10144 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10144) `closed`: [SMTChecker] BMC reports invalid "condition is always false"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-10-28 21:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10144):

This is extracted from CirclesUBI:
```
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract Token  {
    bool private manuallyStopped; // true if this token has been stopped by it's owner

    function stop() public {
        manuallyStopped = true;
    }

    function stopped() public view returns (bool) {
        if (manuallyStopped) return true;
        return false;
    }

    function look() public view returns (uint256) {
        if (stopped()) return 0;
        return 1;
    }
}
```

```
Warning: BMC: Condition is always false.

The CHC engine can by design solve this, but why does BMC reports anything?

CHC actually doesn't run these checks. And it's weird that BMC is reporting that.
