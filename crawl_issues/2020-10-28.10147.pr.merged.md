Some cool news also that `chai` compiles with this to both evm and ewasm targets :)

@leonardoalt why do we have this SMT issue on the CI again? :)

@axic because Spacer has nondeterminism issues. Sometimes it's really hard to find out which tests are triggering that

> Also, shouldn't a matching option be added to Standard JSON too?

I thought about that, but I'd argue this is still just experimental development option for us mostly, so no point adding it to standard json. (And also I did not wanted to deal with adding tests for that.)

ok. I won't insist though I think it would better to have the same stuff available in both. And actually all the experimental output options are already there. But yeah I know that adding it in both places with duplicate tests and all is a bit of a pain :) Hopefully #9583 will make it easier eventually.

This should have an effect on the metadata.

What do you mean? The experimental flag? Sure, we can set that, but please note the metadata is not even included in the binary yet. I have worked on that locally, but requires quite a few changes/fixes.

The fact that the new pipeline was used should be a setting for the metadata. I would prefer to prepare that already, otherwise we might forget.

Added a test.

Marked the experimental flag. Should it be something else?

I think that the point is to be able to tell which pipeline was used by looking at metadata. The `experimental` flag can be triggered by other stuff like SMT so I think it's not enough on its own.

So as if one used `pragma experimental viaYul;`?

Although in that case still the `viaYul` option wouldn't be in the metadata, only the `experimental` flag anyway

@chriseth this is still blocked on your feedback, but I guess you meant having the `viaIR` option exposed via standard json and storing that under settings in the metadata json?

Please add the setting to the metadata.
