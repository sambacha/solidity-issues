# [\#10149 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10149) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Creating Verification targets in two stages.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-10-29 09:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10149):

In order to remember the values of variables at the place of error for CEX reporting and to correctly consider all potential errors for all external functions, all verification targets are now created in two stages (similarly as Assert targets have been so far). 

This removes some problems, like #10087, #10034 and also spurious overflows in internal functions.
On the other hand, with the new encoding Spacer is no longer able to solve some targets in examples with loop.

The CLI test fails, because the example in the documentation (`docs/security-considerations.rst`) expects assertion violation to be reported, but the example actually shows a contract with only an internal function, so it cannot be called and now SMTChecker detects that the assertion there is actually unreachable and does not report the violation anymore. We need to change the example in the docs.

@blishko regarding the documentation example, you can update it to:

        a[0] = 2;
        c[0][0] = 2;
        b[0] = 1;
        // Erasing knowledge about memory references should not
        // erase knowledge about state variables.
        assert(array1[0] == 42);
        // However, an assignment to a storage reference will erase

        d[0] = 2;

@leonardoalt I have updated the example in the docs and the CLI tests are passing now.
The last problem seems to be the test `while_loop_array_assignment_storage_storage` where Spacer can solve some target in  Linux distribution, but cannot solve it in my local (and also in the OSX in CI). Can you run the tests locally and see which result you get?

@blishko I ran the tests locally and I get the same as CI. I think it's better if you comment the problematic assertions with a comment "removed because of spacer nondeterminism"

Ok, I will squash. But we should also add a changelog entry, right? We should log the bugfix for the values of CEX, and then there is the change of how the other targets (beside assert) are treated now.

True, then please add Changelog entries for the bugfixes (the two bugs you mentioned in the first comment). I don't think we need to add one for how the other targets are treated.

@leonardoalt, changelog entry added. We don't have to very about all the warnings people might get about overflows now? There is no 0.7.5 planned? The next released version will be 0.8?

@blishko there will probably be at least one, maybe two 0.7 releases before 0.8. We could warn, but not sure it's necessary. People will just see them as false positives, and only if they end up using this specific version.
