**Solidity version 0.7.4**

Should the compiler warn about such name clashes even if one of them is a file-level function and the other one a function declared inside an interface?

The compiler does not warn because ``MemoryInterface::getUint`` is external. It is impossible to refer to it just via `getUint`, you always need a contract type for it.

But the compiler does warn: `This declaration shadows an existing declaration.`

This is the file:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.7.4;

interface MemoryInterface {
    function getUint(uint256 _id) external returns (uint256);
}

function getUint(uint256 getId, uint256 val) returns (uint256 returnVal) {
    returnVal = getId == 0
        ? val
        : MemoryInterface(getMemoryAddr()).getUint(getId);
}
```

Ah sorry about that! You can can maybe get around this by moving the function into its own file and importing the file as a module.

Yep I did that. Fine for now :) 

Btw I enjoy this new file-level function feature a lot.

Just ran into it myself. We really need to fix it.

```solidity
interface I {
    function f(uint) external returns (uint);
}

function f(uint) returns (uint) {}
```

I have a proposed fix witch assumes that the issue is more general and that **any declaration inside an interface can not shadow file-level declaration**, not only function declaration.  However, tests with this fix fails on [error_selector_syntax.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/38468d03f49e0a1c41bcf286e40b7bf728649faa/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/errors/error_selector_syntax.sol#L33) which warns that an **error** declaration in an Interface shadows a file-level error declaration.

I am not sure whether my approach is wrong or whether the existing test is wrong.  For example:
```solidity
interface I {
        error Er(bool);
}
error Er(bytes4);
contract C1 {
        function g() public pure {
                revert Er(Er.selector);
        }
}
contract C3 is I {
        function g() public pure {
                revert Er(true);
        }
}

Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
 --> <stdin>:2:2:
  |
2 |     error Er(bool);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: The shadowed declaration is here:
 --> <stdin>:4:1:
  |
4 | error Er(bytes4);
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
There are no compilation errors about type conversion when `Er()` is used, meaning that as expected `C1` uses the file-level `Er()` declaration and `C3 is I` is using the `Er()` declaration from `I`.

Is my approach correct (and [error_selector_syntax.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/38468d03f49e0a1c41bcf286e40b7bf728649faa/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/errors/error_selector_syntax.sol) should be modified)?  Is the issue only for functions?  Is it about a subset of declarations in an Interface, e.g. only function, struct, enum?
