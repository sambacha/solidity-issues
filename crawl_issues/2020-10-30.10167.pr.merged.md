# [\#10167 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10167) `merged`: [BREAKING] Remove --old-reporter from solc

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-10-30 21:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10167):

Closes #7369.

The question from #7369 remains: StandardCompiler uses the old reporter for the `formattedMessage` field. Do we want to change that too?

I think it would make sense to remove from both.

If we want to get rid of it, we should remove it everywhere.

I know, we discussed it yesterday. It is in progress, but it is quite a bit of work, especially fixing all the tests.

Reminder: this is waiting for a review. It makes no sense (for me) to keep updating the test expectations as many other PRs are touching those. I'll of course do a final test update after there's some agreement of the review and we are close to merging.

@axic so the code is ready?

The code is. Tests needs to be updated once-again before merge, and need to fix solc-js too.

@bshastry need feedback on the fuzzer changes.

Test failures and needs rebase.

All tests were updated 2 rebases ago, but then I removed it because no point updating it (painfully), unless I get feedback on the actual code changes.

I would propose to fix the solcjs failure after this has been merged.

Do we have a breaking branch for solcjs? Do we want one? Should we just loosen up the check in the test to search for `SyntaxError: Invalid pragma "contract"` ?

I think we are good enough with this: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/504
