# [\#10177 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10177) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Report SMTEncoder warnings also via CHC

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-11-02 15:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10177):

Currently CHC does not forward the unsupported warning messages from SMTEncoder to the ErrorReporter given by CompilerStack, since it relies on BMC running after and doing that. Since now engines can be run separately, this is a problem if you run CHC only, since the "unsupported" messages will *not* be displayed.
This PR makes CHC forward the SMTEncoder messages similar to what BMC does.
The effect of that is getting duplicated messages.
I think that's fine for now because:
- We want to support the reported features and remove those messages anyway
- It's better to make it safe right away and then improve the readability of the messages

> I noticed in some of tests that BMC reports multiple unsupported warnings for same location, while CHC gives only one. I guess this is fine.

Yea I noticed that too, also CHC sometimes gives `Internal expression not defined` whereas BMC doesn't, but I think it should be solved separately.
