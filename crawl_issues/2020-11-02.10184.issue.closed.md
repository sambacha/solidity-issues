Similar to storage offset/slot and the proposed calldata offset/slot (#8917) it would be nice to have `.offset` and `.size` properties.

While `.offset` is easily replaced with `add(b, 32)` and `.size` with `mload(b)`, it could be nice to follow the same logic as for storage/calldata.

I don't think this is a good idea. We should expose as little as needed.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
