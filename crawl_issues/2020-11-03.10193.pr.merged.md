Fixed the test failure locally, but looking into some other improvement before I push.

> looking into some other improvement before I push.

It turned out this test parser has quite a few shortcomings, including the really messy relationship with `langutil`. Cleaning it up perhaps be better in a separate PR if we want to get this one merged more quickly as a quick fix.

Update: made a bunch of refactoring and it is much nicer. Will push tomorrow.

Added the non-literal test case. It seems the padding only ever happens with literals on V1. I think this should be merged as-is, but will create a separate PR for TestFileParser refactoring.

This looks like it only affects `revert` but it is an issue with abi encoding in general, right? Can you add a test?

@chriseth what test? `abi.encode("")` ?

Also @chriseth you could respond to my previous question: what extra tests are you looking for?

Actually we should check that all Solidity decoders accept a non-padded empty string.

It is actually the fact that `// compileViaYul: also` is present, which turns on V2. Not sure why that field is there for other files in the directory when it is explicitly called `V1`.

Fixed.

Oh I'm sorry! I thought this would be a fix for the abi encoder, but it's just about the test file parser.

It is fixing the parser and adding tests which needed that fix, but happy to extend the test suite if you have more ideas to cover.

@chriseth so merging this then or are then any new tests we could do?
