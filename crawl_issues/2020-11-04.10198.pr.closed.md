This PR is related to #8755, it contains small refactoring and introduction of classes for using different Spacer strategies and possibly combine them.

From small experiments I have conducted with this, the current settings of Spacer options were the best, but running a backup query with weak abstraction disabled in Spacer resulted in two additional assertions successfully decided which timed out before.

As agreed, there is a better way to implement new strategies in Spacer. Also the actual benefit so far is not that big compared to the increased runtime due to more queries being issued.
