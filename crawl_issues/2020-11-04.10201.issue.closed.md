Prerequisite for fixing #9278.

The JSON output of `solc --abi` is documented in [Contract ABI Specification > JSON](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html#json) but only for contracts. The information returned for libraries differs but the differences are not documented.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
