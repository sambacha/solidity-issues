# [\#10202 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10202) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix CHC false positives when using branches inside modifiers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-11-04 21:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10202):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10200

The fix is to also add modifiers' parameters and local variables to FunctionBlock predicates as local variables of the function, since modifiers are inlined.
This is also necessary for early return, which is where the bug was found.
