In the cases where the warning is replaced with an assertion, we would silently create crashes when new features are introduced and we forget to add them to the SMTChecker.

This is not a problem if we run the entire test suite with enabling the SMTchecker, even if we don't expect solutions for them. I think it would be cool to have such a CI run to search for crashes.

I do that locally once in a while, not sure we need a CI job just for that

@axic I just ran all `syntaxTests` with SMTChecker enabled and found 2 exceptions thrown because of named arguments, and some others because of free functions.

Well, can you add a test for the named args and throw an unsupported warning?

I think it's easier to implement it than to add the error.

@leonardoalt is this unblocked now?

@axic yes

@axic can we merge this?

```
./libsolidity/formal/SMTEncoder.cpp:1127: useable ==> usable
```

Can you fix this here?

So basically we have two options:
a) Keep uncovered branches for potential future features with an error code, and keep an exception in the coverage, because they can't be tested for.

b) Keep (unimplemented) asserts instead. We assume that when a new feature is introduced, we'll quickly notice the assertion is hit, and at that time we'll decide whether to leave a warning or implement it properly. 

And we are choosing b) with this PR.

I'm fine with either options. @chriseth ?

@leonardoalt needs rebase :)

@axic : @chriseth said on Gitter that it's up to us.

Let's go with the current version then, because:
a) we definitely will get reports of crashes if it happens, while nobody would report the unimplemented warning
b) the unimplemented warning may or may not be causing invalid, but undetected, outcomes
