Should that be mentioned in the changelog? Is there a specific test affected by this?

@axic no, it's a sol->yul bugfix, so no mention in the changelog.

@mijovic @chriseth just want to bring to attention that inline `.offset` behaves differently than offset as described in ABI specification section of docs, which leads to confusion (at least for me). Inline offset points at data, bypassing length prefix, whereas in calldata, the encoded offset points to the length prefix if applicable, as explicitly described in docs. I know this is way belated!
