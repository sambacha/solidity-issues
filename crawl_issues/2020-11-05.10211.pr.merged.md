This PR does only copying of non nested arrays.
Will follow up with another PR that does copy nested arrays as well.

I think we need to modify the decoder a little for dynamic arrays. The function abiDecodingFunctionArray would be the right candidate ,but it reads the length from calldata instead of from a function parameter. You could modify that function to extract the part after reading the length and then call that function.

I have one more test that copies various types of nested arrays. It has one case which doesn't work, so will do another update to PR with the test itself and update to source code.
