calldatacopy, call, returndatacopy and others should only invalidate the areas in memory that are larger than the start position. This is especially useful if the start position is a constant. If the end position is a constant, this can also be taken into account.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
