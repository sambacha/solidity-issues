# [\#10215 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10215) `merged`: Command-line tests: Rename .sol files with Yul code to .yul

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-05 17:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10215):

Just a minor refactor. It's been possible to use `.yul` extension in command-line tests for a while now (f56fd5bde8c5b0e3ed7d2d13ce2e6ccac5064da4). This PR just renames `.sol` files containing Yul code to end with `.yul` and fixes any names stored in these files.
