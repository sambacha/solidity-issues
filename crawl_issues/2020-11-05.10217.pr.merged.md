# [\#10217 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10217) `merged`: [ewasm] Allow compiling Yul without "main"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-11-05 17:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10217):

Prior to this we'd have
```
Unknown exception during compilation: map::at:  key not found
```

Not sure which is better, a) having an assert, b) or allowing Yul objects without `main`. I think b) is more correct in terms of Wasm, but not in terms of Ewasm.

Having thought about this, I think option b) (aka the last commit) is the correct option, because this is a generic wasm output. The dialect should decide what is correct for the dialect (not that we have a way to enforce that right now, but at least with this change it is possible to compile arbitrary yul code to wasm and use it).

> The current ewasm spec (Contract Interface > exports) says that main is one of the two required exported symbols. So I guess it will fail to run when deployed? Or even be undeployable? I think there should be at least a warning about it if the produced binary has no main().

As mentioned I think the `BinaryTransform` is a generic wasm output, it is not only for the ewasm dialect.

> BTW, is there currently a way to produce a wasm binary without main() from normal input? Or would it be a bug in Yul -> Wasm translation?

Yes, try compiling any Yul file :wink:

Oh, ok then.

Ah, right. I assumed that it might be generated automatically but now that I think about it, I don't remember seeing it in the Yul->Wasm translator so it must be at a higher level.

In fairness to make this fully nice, we'd still need some kind of system to mark external functions, but this PR is a step.
