# [\#10218 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10218) `closed`: Use consistent style for placeholders in command-line test output

**This PR is based on #10216. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

This is just a cleanup that updates the style of placeholders for removed stuff so that it's the same for both JSON and non-JSON tests.

Originally a part of #10216 but I extracted it because it adds a lot of trivial noise.

Closing in favor of #10225 which replaces #10216 and already includes this refactor.
