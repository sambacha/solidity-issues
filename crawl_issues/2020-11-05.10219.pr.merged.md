> Is it possible to add tests for wasm code now that we have hera plugged in? I think they're badly needed.

Do we have a testing infrastructure? I think we only have it for evm->wasm translation.

#9929 has not been merged yet but I thought that the basic support for writing wasm tests was already in? The `compileToEwasm` option seems to be already in develop (though no tests use it yet):

That doesn't seem to do anything, but even if it were, it would require the IR + evm->wasm given it is in `libsolidity/SemanticTest`. What we are missing entirely is testing infrastructure for yul->wasm in `libyul`.

Merging this to reduce PR count. Tested the outputs locally and they were valid.
