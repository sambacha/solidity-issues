# [\#10221 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10221) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Refactor array conversions

Calldata conversion were ending up in conversion function if they are static arrays, and in conversionFunctionSpecial if they are dynamic (as it's representation on stack had 2 items)

So, for example if we have copying of arrays from calldata to memory for example, we would have to implement it in two  completely different locations as there is a call in `conversionFunction`
```
if (_from.sizeOnStack() != 1 || _to.sizeOnStack() != 1)
	return conversionFunctionSpecial(_from, _to);
```
Since the code for both cases is the same, except a fact how we determine length of calldata array, I believe this should be the same function. That is why I added another function that will serve to do array conversion.

Hope it helps to create context for reviewing this PR :)

When working on #10211 I realized this, so will rebase that PR over this one

Also, I'll tag @ekpyron here as he was the one that wanted this to be done. So, he can see this when back.
