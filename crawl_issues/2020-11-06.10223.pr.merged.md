# [\#10223 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10223) `merged`: [BREAKING] Strict conversion

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13174375?u=52d702cb6bec53b561afa293cf9cd53ef7a63924&v=4" width="50">[hrkrshnn](https://github.com/hrkrshnn) opened issue at [2020-11-06 11:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10223):

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9939

Decision on:
- [x] Conversions between Contract type and integer type. Should we only allow `C(uint160)`?
- [x] Conversion between Enums. If an enum `E` is represented by type `uint8`, should `uint16(E)` etc be disallowed?

Disallowed conversions from `integer -> contract` 

The behaviour of enums is unchanged.

Concerning the first question: Depending on how often this happens, I would disallow any conversion between contract and uint - it has to go through address.

Regarding the second question: for consistency, I think it should be required to `uint16(uint8(e))`

Are the same rules already valid for implicit conversion?

I'm wondering whether we should reconsider this - also see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10317

I would propose to disallow conversions between fixed point types as a breaking change so we have more freedom if we introduce them in a non-breaking change.

Also - are explicit conversions now fully symmetric? If yes, we could maybe extract that into isolated functions.
