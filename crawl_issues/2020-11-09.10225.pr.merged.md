# [\#10225 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10225) `merged`: Strip bytecode from command-line test output but preserve link references

Another attempt at #10216. Now combined with the refactor from #10218.

This PR modifies `cmdlineTests.sh` so that all byte code in test output is replaced with `<BYTECODE REMOVED>` placeholders but any unresolved link references are preserved to make it possible to add tests for library linking.

In JSON output bytecode is easily detected by because it's always under the `"object"` key. In non-JSON output I'm using metadata markers (as described in #10216) to avoid false-positives. I'm assuming that it's better to cut too little rather than too much because any missed bytecode will cause CI failures and be easily spotted.

Looks like I need to tweak the regexes to work on MacOS too because #10227 fails otherwise.

If this is so tricky, why not do a regular C++-based test that does not need auto-updating?

@chriseth I went with this mostly because I wanted to keep it simple. I only needed to know if the link references are gone or not. Turned out not to be all that simple but it was easier in a way - the change was localized to the regexes and I can test both CLI and JSON in a uniform way.

But yeah, looking back, C++ tests seem like a better option for general linker tests. This PR is done though - should I leave it as is or do you think it does  make sense to switch to the C++ tests now? Might be worth it for easier maintenance. On the other hand being able to use `--libraries` in command-line tests might sometimes come in handy when testing other features in combination with it.

If it's ready then it's fine.

OK. It's only a draft because I have to adjust the regex for MacOS and I wanted to go back to that when I'm done submitting the PRs.

Failures in #10227 fixed and tests passed there so I'm squashing the fixup and marking this as ready for review again.

Turns out it was only failing there because we don't have any non-JSON tests that would output bytecode and the JSON regexes already use `-E` and are fine on MacOS.
