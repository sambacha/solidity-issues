# [\#10227 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10227) `merged`: Command-line tests for linking

**This PR is based on #10225. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

Linker does not seem to be covered by any tests that check the whole process end-to-end. Would be nice to have some for #8078.

Tests fail due to the differences between Linux and MacOS `sed`. I need to tweak the regexes. I think that switching from `-e` to `-E` should help.

Switching to `-E` fixed tests on MacOS so I'm marking it as ready for review.
