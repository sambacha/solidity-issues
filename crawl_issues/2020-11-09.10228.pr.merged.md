Function call graph (#10973) has been merged so I guess we can now revive this PR. @Marenz, will you be working it do you want someone else to take over?

I can do it, looking forward to using the call graph!

Is this actually up for review now? I think @Marenz said yesterday that he's still working on something here so I decided to wait and watch and in the meantime I started reviewing keccak instead :)

@cameel ah ok, not sure, I based the requests on `Marenz marked this pull request as ready for review 18 hours ago` above

No, this is ready now

I pushed an update for this PR that takes care of ~80% of the feedback here. Still a WIP though. Everything marked as resolved should be fine though.

Updated, but still WIP, some things are still missing.

Can you add a semantic test that shows that having a "fake cyclic dependency" through a function in a base contract that is never called actually works?

You mean an `internal` function correct?

Yes, we discussed such examples in the context of whether or not the base contract should be automatically added to the dependencies or not.

Added requested test case: 
```
contract C
{
	// Internal uncalled function should not cause an cyclic dep. error
	function foo() internal { new D(); }
}

contract D is C
{
}
```

I think we should also add a more complicated case:
There is another public function in `C` that calls `foo`, but it is overwritten in `D` by an empty function.

That would still cause an error though if C is not abstract, that is.

Needs rebase.
