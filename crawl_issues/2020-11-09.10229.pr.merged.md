# [\#10229 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10229) `merged`: Linking in assembly mode

**This PR is based on #10227. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

Note: There's no linking when `--machine wasm` is used. I could have added it but I would not be able to check if it works because Yul code with `linkersymbol()` won't get translated to wasm yet anyway (#10173).

Just mark it draft and can't be accidentally merged.

But this is ready for review. It's just that it needs to be merged in the right order. Merging it into `develop` would also merge the PR below.
