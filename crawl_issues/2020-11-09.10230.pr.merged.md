# [\#10230 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10230) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] External library calls

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-09 12:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10230):

Part of #8078.
Fixes many bugs in #10235.

**This PR is based on #10229. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

Adds support for `address(L)` and `L.f()`-style external calls.

Semantic tests require linking to pass - that's why this is based on #10229.

Note that there are apparently no call guards generated for libraries yet so `library_address.sol` does not pass even though the code for the call itself is generated correctly.

Rebased and added (and reverted) commits. Did not touch your commits, so we have to squash some.

I pushed fixes for some of the comments. The only thing remaining is https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10230#discussion_r521513228 which is waiting for a decision whether to add a workaround for the missing variable to get tests to pass or to go back to my version (which did pass the tests before).

I also did not modify existing commits (except for rebasing them) and added my changes as unsquashed fixups for now.

I think this is now the right way to do it. An expression of type T should result in IR being generated such that all stack items of T are properly defined as yul variables.

Not sure what to make of the error message `"c&"o\n" is not found.`

ok. I saw that a lot of stuff is done this way but I didn't know that it was a general rule. I thought that not having the no-op conversion was preferable. In that case the PR should fine now after your addition of the missing variable. I squashed all the fixups and extra commits.

It comes from my multi-source test for weird library names with special characters (both characters that need to be escaped like `"` and `\` as well as non-printable control characters). `ASTImportTest.sh` and `stopAfterParseTests.sh` are choking on it because they don't properly quote file names and assume that values can be safely passed through shell evaluation. I tried to fix the scripts but pure-shell workarounds were either horrible or non-portable to Mac. It would be quick and easy in Python but I didn't want to go that far so I'm giving up for now. I removed the test.

BTW, while working on it I also made a proper fix for #9710 so the script does not bail out on broken UTF-8 and splits the file properly instead. I'll submit it later because I need to clean up the error handling around it a bit first.
