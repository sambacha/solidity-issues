# [\#10233 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10233) `merged`: Arbitrary input file extensions in command-line tests

Related to #10215.

Currently the command-line tests explicitly check for `input.sol`, `input.yul` or `input.json`. This PR changes that so any extension except for `.json` is allowed and is assumed to be non-JSON input.

The primary motivation behind this PR was adding command-line tests for `--link` option which expects `.bin` files. In the end that didn't work out because linker does not play well with command-line tests (it modifies input in place) but I think that this change is useful on its own too.

I think I got the test failure fixed. Let's see if it works in CI.

The input file name ended up with a double slash on MacOS because BSD find preserves the trailing slash in the path you give it while GNU find does not. I.e. `find dir/ -name 'input.*'` finds `dir//input.sol` on Mac OS.
