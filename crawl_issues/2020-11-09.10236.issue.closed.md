This came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3044#issuecomment-618358552:

It would be useful to have a step which translates `extcodecopy(address(), ..)` to `codecopy(..)` and `extcodesize(address())` to `codesize()`.

However, this change CAN NOT be done within the constructor as these two opcodes refer to two different pieces of data there and are not interchangeable.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
