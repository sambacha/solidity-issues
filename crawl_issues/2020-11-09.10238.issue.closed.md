See https://editorconfig-checker.github.io/

i.e.g what is the point having the `.editorconfig` if we don't enforce it. This tool helps to do that.

@cameel @christianparpart since you have modified the configuration, what do you think?

I'm all for enforcing it for newly created files but I'm not sure it's a good idea for existing ones. Currently a lot of files don't stick to these rules unfortunately. It would require reindenting a lot of code and make `git blame` less useful.

Anyway, even without enforcing it I think that `.editorconfig` is useful because many editors recognize it (there's even a vim plugin: https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim).

In general I disagree with this statement, as that would mean that projects can never fix their code style. And `git blame` works even after reformatting, for affected lines just need to do blame on the commit prior.

While it is unfortunate not enforcing rules earlier, I think it is a bad direction not enforcing it ever.

I don't think we need to enforce it. It is a recommendation.

Why do we have coding styles, guides, and recommendations, when we do not make use of it? Sounds rather pointless to me.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
