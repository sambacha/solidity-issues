# [\#10241 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10241) `merged`: [solc] Handle exceptions in AssemblyStack.translate() gracefully

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-11-09 18:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10241):

Easy way to crash this was a `yul::OptimizerException`:
```
{
function main() { }
}
```

With `solc --strict-assembly --machine ewasm --yul-dialect evm wasm-crash.yul` results in an exception:
```
Exception in assembler: /Users/alex/Projects/solidity/libyul/optimiser/MainFunction.cpp(43): Throw in function void solidity::yul::MainFunction::operator()(solidity::yul::Block &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::OptimizerException>
std::exception::what: 
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = 
```

> This is good as a quick patch but I think that a better general solution would be to have just a single top-level block that catches all stray exceptions and reports details. That might be something to do in #9583 though.

I agree, but I really wanted to quickly fix this and not end up with refactoring.

Btw, even in the `assemble` function the two (now three) blocks of try/catch use different wording, but I resisted to urge to fix that.
