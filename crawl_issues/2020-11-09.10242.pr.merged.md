Right, the update script stalled because of #10248 / #10249. Will need to wait for that one.

I rebased this on `develop`. #10251 (which replaced #10249) is already merged so this PR should be fine to merge too once tests pass.

> tests need update

You probably mean this:

Expected:
```
;; The Keccak-256 hash of the text representation: f03f5b9154b9eb6803a947177e38e92e2860de95e90ba0e75eb71a58f18ed589
```
Got:
```
;; The Keccak-256 hash of the text representation of \"C_2_deployed\": f03f5b9154b9eb6803a947177e38e92e2860de95e90ba0e75eb71a58f18ed589
```

Since the fix has been merged, I updated the commit so tests should be passing now.
