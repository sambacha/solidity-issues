# [\#10244 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10244) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Analyzing external calls to `this`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-11-10 08:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10244):

This PR resolves #9385.
External calls to `this` can be analyzed in a similar manner as internal calls, since we know and can trust the code of the called function.
The difference is that such external call creates a new transaction and this needs to be incorporated in the encoding.

@leonardoalt I will try to add more tests for this and also some comments. You can also suggest something if you think some feature should be tested.
I think you can review the code in the meantime.
