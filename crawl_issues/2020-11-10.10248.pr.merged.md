# [\#10248 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10248) `merged`: cmdlineTests.sh: Fix buggy calculation of the number of input files

**This PR is based on #10251. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

Bugfix for #10233.

I used `echo "${inputFiles}"` which adds a newline and `wc` counts it as a line even if it's empty. This means that `inputCount` is always >= 1.

Updated.

**Please note that I reversed the PRs. This one is now on top of ~#10249~ #10251**. I did this because otherwise tests won't pass and I need to know if there are any problems on Mac OS.
