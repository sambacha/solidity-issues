# [\#10249 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10249) `merged`: Assume input.sol by default in command-line tests (restores old behavior)

**This PR is based on #10248. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

Restores the old behavior of `cmdlineTests.sh` in case where there are no input files. In #10248 I made it report an error but this broke the assumptions made in #10199.

I don't think it's a good default but command-line tests are broken on `develop` because of this. It's at least no worse than it was before and works as a quick fix.
