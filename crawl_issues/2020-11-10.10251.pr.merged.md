# [\#10251 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10251) `merged`: Assume input.sol by default in command-line tests (restores old behavior) (reopened)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-10 16:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10251):

*Resubmitting #10249 because github thought it got merged when I swapped the order with #10248 and won't let me reopen it. The content is exactly the same but it's now directly on develop.*

> Restores the old behavior of `cmdlineTests.sh` in case where there are no input files. In #10248 I made it report an error but this broke the assumptions made in #10199.
>
> I don't think it's a good default but command-line tests are broken on `develop` because of this. It's at least no worse than it was before and works as a quick fix.
