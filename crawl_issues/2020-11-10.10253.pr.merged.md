# [\#10253 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10253) `merged`: Yul indentation rules in .editorconfig

Similar to #10237.

I don't think any particular style is currently dominant in our `.yul` tests. There's a variety of styles: 2 spaces, 4 spaces and 1 tab; some files even mix multiple styles. But I think there's no good reason to have different indentation styles for `.sol` and `.yul` and the current rule for `.sol` is 4 spaces so I suggest we use that.

I'm aware that `.editorconfig` is not enforced but it's often used by editors/IDEs which is convenient. It also makes it more likely that the right indentation settings will be picked up automatically by tools people use.
