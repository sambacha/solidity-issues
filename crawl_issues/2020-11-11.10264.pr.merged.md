Part of #6905.

Done this back in July but forgot to push.

The clang I have locally worked with the very first commit, but of course CI versions find different problems.

@bshastry can you check the fuzzer changes? @cameel can you check the phaser changes?

I give up. Updating the once-ready PR took forever and can't get rid of that compiler crash with gcc 7.5.0.

We should still try to merge some parts, like the interfaceid fix.

They're all fine, though I think we should be using `static_cast<double>()` rather than `double`. I know that changing it now will be tedious so I can do that for you if this PR is still on the table.

Why `static_cast`?

Why not? It does not require a force conversion. It's just the normal int -> double conversion that the compiler does implicitly anyway.

This is still blocked on the compiler crash. Couldn't isolate which change caused it so far. Extremely annoying as this shouldn't be a PR lasting months.

Depends on #10499.

@bshastry what is the better fix?

I need to take a closer look. For example, where only 32-bit numbers are required I could change the protobuf message type to `int32` instead of `int64` that saves the static cast.

That would be nice.

We can squash this prior to merging.
