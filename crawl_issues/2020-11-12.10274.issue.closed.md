(This issue is splitting up #8847.)

> Some options available to the standard-json format do not seem to be available as CLI flags. I'm missing in particular source mappings for yul which was introduced only for the json options in #8378. It would be nice if feature parity between CLI flags and json opts was pursued as a general rule.

CLI has no equivalent for `evm.bytecode.linkReferences` and `evm.deployedBytecode.immutableReferences` outputs from Standard JSON.

Another thing are all the outputs available in assembly mode in Standard JSON. #12074 allows selecting outputs in assembly mode but does not add anything beyond what compiler was already printing.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I think this is something we still want to (or at least should) do. Reopening.

This is an obvious part of rewriting CLI backed by standard-json. Do we really need a separate issue for this? We won't do it before that and without that - and with that, we can do it right away...

I'm not sure it's an obvious part. You could very well rewrite it keeping the features it has currently without adding parity.

We'll achieve parity by just allowing the CLI to generically amend the standard-json it generates while deprecating. It's part of the rewrite, I'm closing this :-).
