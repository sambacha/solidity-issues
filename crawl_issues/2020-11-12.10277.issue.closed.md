On the call today we decided to move this to the Icebox for now. It was requested but it could open a whole can of worms so we don't want to do it right now but we'll consider it if there's more demand.

I would like to add my support for this feature.
My problem with raw warnings is that they are not really actionable in an automated way.
Either I want to selectively ignore a warning, or I want to fix a warning.
To do so, warnings as errors would be a helpful cornerstone.

@fkirc  Are you using a framework, IDE or just the compiler directly?

I am using Truffle, but I believe that this would be a good flag for the compiler directly.

I don't see us doing this in the compiler - and frameworks are free to consider our warnings as errors. So I'm closing this as part of our issue maintenance pass. Feel free to reopen, if you disagree.
