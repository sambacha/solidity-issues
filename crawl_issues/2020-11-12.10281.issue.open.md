Also text after the notice tag is included no matter how many empty lines:
```
contract C {
  /// Before the notice.
  /// @notice Some function.
  ///
  ///
  ///
  /// After the notice.
  function f() public view returns (uint ret) {
  }
}
```

```

    {
      "notice": "Before the notice.Some function. After the notice."

  },
  "version": 1
}
```

Inserting a tag between the notice and trailing text works as expected (well, the text on the new line is also part of `@return):
```
contract C {
  /// Before the notice.
  /// @notice Some function.
  ///
  ///
  ///
  /// @return ret something
  /// After the notice.
  function f() public view returns (uint ret) {
  }
}
```

```

```

I start to think this is by design :)

I think the rule is that NatSpec comment without a tag is assumed to be notice. That explains all the above situations.

Why do we have `@notice` then? It seems to be confusing.

Can we remove `@notice` and say that every untagged natspec comment is included as a "comment" field?

However what happens in the case where there comments and tags intermixed. Are all the comments concatenated together?

I wasn't there when this was designed. My guess is that the no-tag -> notice was done so that existing `///` doesn't break.

I think removing `@notice` might be too much now, since that will break a lot of contracts. Maybe removing comments without tags might make more sense.

I think you can have
```
@dev bla
@notice blu
```

But probably we should disallow `@notice` if there is already untagged text in front of it.

We had a discussion about this on today's meeting.

Currently any untagged content (i.e. `/// Hello world`) defaults to `@notice`. Multiple tagged or untagged `@notice`s are concatenated together.

The question we had whether untagged comments are for the user or the developer. If they are for the developer, then we should have the following rules:
- Only one `@notice` tag is allowed, and it is exported for the user documentation.
- Remove `@dev`. Anything untagged is concatenated and exported as "dev documentation`.

 I think the current behaviour is fine. Disallowing multiple `notice`, I think is not nice, in situations like these:

```
/// @notice long paragraph on contract
///
/// @notice another long paragraph on contract.
contract C {
}
```

However, currently this gets parsed as `  "notice": "long paragraph on contractanother long paragraph",`. Probably missing a space.

I support the current behavior.  

imo assuming the top /// lines without tags are @notice is a feature not a bug.  

Ever since I learned about this I've stopped using the @notice in most cases and imo the code looks so much cleaner now.

It also adds to the conversation of should you try and indent your multi-line natspec comments since a lot of multi-line comments are @notice so if you skip the tag then it is aligned to the left.

```
contract MyContract {

  /// This is a multiline comment and it looks so nice aligned to the left, 
  /// also now I don't need to think about whether or not I should indent
  /// the lines after the first to align the first characters.
  /// @param x This is the amount of the param.
  /// @param y This is the other amount of the param.
  /// function myFunction(uint256 x, uint256 y) public {...}
}
```
