# [\#10289 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10289) `merged`: Fix standard JSON crash on linker references without a colon

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-14 02:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10289):

The code that formats `linkReferences` key was assuming that the references always contain both a file name and a library name, separated with a colon. This used to be true because only the compiler can create them when compiling Solidity and for Yul Standard JSON didn't support linking until very recently (#10229). Now this has changed.
