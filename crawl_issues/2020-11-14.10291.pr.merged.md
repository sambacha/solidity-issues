# [\#10291 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10291) `merged`: Refresh linker docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-14 03:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10291):

- The 36-character limit mentioned on the page about libraries is no longer relevant because compiler does not generate old-style link references.
- A warning that linking with `--link` does not produce the same exact binary (#10082).
- Info that you can separate values passed to `--libraries` with commas too (I needed it for command-line and only realized that it's possible after digging into the code; docs were not mentioning it).
- Most of the linker info from `Libraries` page moved to `Using the compiler` to have it in one location with a linkable header.
