# [\#10292 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10292) `merged`: [CLI] Reject duplicates in --libraries

Semi-related to #10290.

Standard JSON has the problem with ignoring the file name but on the other hand it's impossible the specify a complete duplicate (same file name and library name). That's not the case with CLI. CLI does not fail if same library file and library name is specified multiple times. If the addresses are different, the last one to be processed wins.

What happens when libraries have the same name but different filename? Should it report error in that case. Also would be great if you can add test to cover that case.

There is a failing ci test.

There is a failing test, yes. But I explained which case would be nice to have as well. Either pass or fail in cmdline tests, just to clarify what happens

Those are different instances in the linker, so are allowed. Unless there is an inheritance conflict during the compilation phase.

@mijovic It will 

> What happens when libraries have the same name but different filename?

With `--standard-json` they're considered a match and linked. I think this is a bug (#10290).
With `--libraries` they're considered different and not linked. Linking succeeds - i.e. does not report an error but the unresolved reference remains in the file. I think this is the correct behavior. They're just different libraries.

> Should it report error in that case.

I think it should not. It's perfectly fine to have two separate files with different libraries having the same name. They'll work fine as long as they're not imported by the same contract.

> Also would be great if you can add test to cover that case.

Sure. I'll add one.

Test added.
