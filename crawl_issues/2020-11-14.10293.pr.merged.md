# [\#10293 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10293) `merged`: [CLI] Fix --output-dir failure for paths with a trailing slash

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-14 03:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10293):

Test contract (`/tmp/test.sol`):
```solidity
contract C {}
```

This is fine:
```bash
solc /tmp/test.sol --output-dir /tmp/a/b/c --bin
```
After running it, `/tmp/a/b/c` is created and contains `C.bin`.

But this fails:
```bash
solc /tmp/test.sol --output-dir /tmp/a/b/c/ --bin
```

Output:
```
Could not write to file "/tmp/a/b/c/C.bin".
```
The only difference is the trailing slash. No files or directories get created.

It was actually an ICE on 0.7.4 but the recent #10241 patched it up. Before that the output was:
```
Exception during output generation: /solidity/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp(739): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::CommandLineInterface::createFile(const string&, const string&)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::util::FileError>
std::exception::what: FileError
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Could not write to file: /tmp/a/b/c/C.bin
```

Can you add test for this?

It's pretty hard in this case. `--output-dir` results in the output going to a newly created directory rather than to stdout and command-line testing currently does not support getting it from there. There's a similar problem with testing `--link` which modifies files in place.

It would be best to create a C++ unit test (using boost test) but we do not have these for `CommandLineInterface`. I actually tried to add a test suite for CLI but gave up. It would require a refactor of `CommandLineInterface` to be more testable. Or splitting it into smaller classes. Currently the output goes to stdout/stderr and private variables and all the intermediate helper methods are private too.
