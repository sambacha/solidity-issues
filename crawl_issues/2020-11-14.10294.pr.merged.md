# [\#10294 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10294) `merged`: Fix bytecode replacement in command-line tests not detecting all bytecode segments between linker references

A trivial issue I did not notice in #10225 because there is no test with more than two unresolved references.

The global regex matches whole link references on both sides of the bytecode wchich results in this (shortened for readability):
```
0123__$abcd$__4567__$efab$_8901__$cdef$__2345
```
being replaced with
```
<BYTECODE REMOVED>__$abcd$__<BYTECODE REMOVED>__$efab$_8901__$cdef$__<BYTECODE REMOVED>
```
rather than with:
```
<BYTECODE REMOVED>__$abcd$__<BYTECODE REMOVED>__$efab$_<BYTECODE REMOVED>__$cdef$__<BYTECODE REMOVED>
```

It leaves out every other piece of bytecode because `sed` does not find overlapping matches. The fix is to match only half of the link reference.

I mean, it would be a test for the test system :) We don't have infrastructure for that.

The best I could do would to be add an artificial linker test that happens to use that feature (or slightly change an existing one). Should I do that?
