# [\#10295 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10295) `closed`: Top level exception handlers in solc and yulrun

We have nothing catching stray exceptions at the top level so the executables crash without any useful debugging info when one happens. And they sometimes do (see e.g. #10241, #10296, #10293).

If you add a top-level one then I'd suggest to remove the specific ones. I always disable these when debugging to see where it stops, and it would be painful to remove it in 3 places because it happens on multiple levels.

I wanted to do that originally but they do add a tiny bit of useful info - the stage where the error happened (during compilation, assembly, etc.). I might be able to preserve it by catching and rethrowing but I wanted to keep it simple.

But sure, if removing that info is fine then I'll add that to the PR.

Ultimately the generic exception catcher does not display any useful information, it is only there to avoid users from freaking out.

The only way to debug it is disabling it and looking at the stack trace.

@axic `catch throw` does not help you?

> catch throw does not help you?

`catch (std::exception)` and `catch (...)` do not display useful information on the CLI, much easier to debug those using a debugger. Other exceptions display nice locations.

In the case of standardjson/soljson.js it makes sense to catch everything as there's no debugging what can be done on those platforms.

However what I said is just better to have a singular top level catch for those if it needs to be, as opposed to having it on multiple layers.

I mean `catch throw` as a gdb command ("I always disable these when debugging to see where it stops").

Oh, nice. Though lldb doesn't have that shortcut: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8122375/lldb-breakpoint-on-exceptions-equivalent-of-gdbs-catch-throw

Still, I would say that if we have the generic exception catcher (for `...` and `std::exception`) that should be in a single place.

What is the state here?

I'm going to remove the other handlers. I still have other things to do first though. Moving back to draft for now.

I'm closing this for now because I don't know when I'll go back to it and there's not much code here anyway. I'll revive it when I have time to do it properly.
