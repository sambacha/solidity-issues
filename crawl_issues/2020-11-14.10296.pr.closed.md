# [\#10296 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10296) `closed`: Handle linkersymbol in yulInterpreter

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-14 04:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10296):

`yulInterpreter` is not handling `linkersymbol()` builtin. This crashes the executable.

Actually, I don't think we can do anything much if we encounter it because the bytecode is simply incomplete. The PR just replaces the assertion with a more generic exception that (in combination with #10295) should at least provide a better error message.

Does anyone has suggestions on how to handle it better?

I would actually disagree. The purpose of the yul interpreter is to be consistent with optimizations and to detect errors in the optimizer. It already has several places where it applies a heuristic, like when querying blockchain data.

Unless we want to test the optimizing on code that has library calls only after linking, I would say it is best to return some hash of the symbol, or the symbol itself.

@leonardoalt I'm going to try to apply @chriseth's suggestion. But I'm currently working on something else and I also have a stack of reviews to go through to it'll take some time (it's not a priority anyway).

Well, since this PR will change significantly, I'm moving it back to draft mode.

In its current form this PR is just a stub and I'm currently working on something completely unrelated I'm going to close it and possibly revive it later when I have time for it.
