# [\#10297 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10297) `merged`: [linker] Avoid spurious errors on stray underscores in --link input

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-11-14 04:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10297):

Linker prints spurious errors if the `.bin` file contains stray underscores. Initially I thought it was a bug but turns out I was just passing the whole `--bin` output rather than only the binary through the linker. Still, the linker does not make too many assumptions about what's in the file and the fix is simple so I think it won' hurt to make it not print these errors. It handles the command-line output surprisingly well.

`input_with_underscores.sol`
```solidity
library L {
    function f() external {}
}

contract C {
    function foo() public {
        L.f();
    }
}
```
```bash
solc input_with_underscores.sol --bin > output.bin
solc output.bin --link --libraries input_with_underscores.sol:L:0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

Output:
```
Reference "_with_underscores.sol:C =======
Binary:
" in file "output.bin" still unresolved.
Reference "_with_underscores.sol:L

======= input_w" in file "output.bin" still unresolved.

```

An alternative approach would be to report an error when a reference without the for underscores is encountered. Maybe that would be actually better?

Looks good! Please squash and merge!

Can this be tested?

Squashed.

@axic Not easily. I actually have a command-line test for this but it works only once because `--link` modifies files in place :) I  could try to modify command-line tests to support this but I think it would be better to just change the option to behave like any other option in the compiler, i.e. to print to stdout by default.

We have a similar problem with testing `--output-dir`.

Weird. I just pushed a rebased branch but github is not showing it...

Sometimes it is slow.
