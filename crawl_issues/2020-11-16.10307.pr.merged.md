Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10303

No changelog entry since this is only present in breaking.

TODO:
 - [x] document how cross-contract access works and whether or not modifiers from libraries are accessible

I just noticed that it's possible to define modifiers inside libraries and interfaces and the compiler does not complain. For libraries it's probably fine but in case of interfaces it seems to be a bug.

A side-effect of the change in the grammar here is that it's now possible to actually use these modifiers.

```solidity
library L {
    modifier m {
        _;
    }
}

contract C {
    function f() public L.m { }
}
```

On 0.7.4:
```
Error: Expected '{' but got '.'
 --> /tmp/test.sol:8:26:
  |
8 |     function f() public L.m { }
  |                          ^
```

After this PR there are no errors.

Do we want this? If so, I think we should mention it in the docs and in the changelog and also add a test covering this usage.

@cameel I think we should not allow cross-contract modifier access, except maybe for internal library modifiers...

Oh, looks like these do work on 0.7.4.

The code seems fine now but your error code is not unique.

Is it still breaking if qualified names didn't work before anyway due to a bug?
The internal unqualified names worked and still do work so they are accessible in some situations.

I think we should just mention where you can define/use modifiers on the documentation page about them.

@cameel you are right ,this just was not possible before!
