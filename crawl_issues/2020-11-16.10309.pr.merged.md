# [\#10309 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10309) `merged`: Fix Visual Studio compilation error (add missing include <optional>)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2020-11-16 16:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10309):

It seems that `<optional>` is included implicitly in other cases (e.g. my `g++` is happy with `#include <map>` instead).
