# [\#10310 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10310) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Adding a dummy frame to the call stack for the implicit constructor

Resolves #10306 

Functions called as part of state variable initialization (implicit constructor) should not be treated as functions on top of the call stack (root function) in the BMC analysis. 
For this reason we add a dummy frame on top of the call stack before analyzing the implicit constructor.

I have tried to find some other examples where the analysis would break, but apart from the situation in #10306, I was not able to find anything.

@blishko can you also remove `6084` from the errors script?

@leonardoalt , I don't see it there. Where do you see it?

Ah true, sorry, I think it was already removed in the PR that added the `bmc_coverage` directory, and this PR simply removes that error, so should be fine.
