## Abstract

I cannot find documentation for `payable` in Solidity docs.

Not sure if this is because of lack of table of contents, per page table of contents in the documentation or this documentation simply does not exist.

Here is a Sphinx search https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.4/search.html?q=payable&check_keywords=yes&area=default#

Here is a Google search https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=solidity%20payable

## Motivation

Not sure how Sphinx search works, but I think all Solidity keywords should be easily searchable.

I suggest restructuring the function modifier page so that it is easier to navigate and read.

Thanks for opening this issue! There is indeed not much documentation about it. We should add a section "state mutability" in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#functions.

@chriseth I would like to contribute to this doc issue. can i sub a pr ?
When a function is marked as payable, it means that it can accept Ether transactions, allowing users to send funds along with the function call.
