Resolves #10144 .

Previously BMC engine did not encode the information that if an `if`-block ends with a `return` statement, the condition of the `if` is false after the block.
This change proposes to remember such information explicitly in the path condition.
It requires two changes:
1. BMC needs a custom handling of `return` statements that takes into account the current path condition and sets the path condition to `false` after this statement.
2. BMC needs a custom handling of `if-then-else` blocks to properly merge the path conditions at the end of the block.

@leonardoalt , I have opened this draft to discuss the change. I needed to customize two methods for BMC that were previously reusing the code from SMTEncoder and I would like to avoid the code duplication, so any suggestions for this are welcome.

@blishko can you also add tests with return inside constructors including inheritance?
