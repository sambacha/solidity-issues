Doesn't this also deserves a changelog entry?

The test case you mention in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10321#pullrequestreview-534830776 does not use the constant evaluator.

@ekpyron if you quickly split the test we can still merge today :p

Actually we can't because ENS is broken on `breaking`

It's not a required test run, we can still merge. It's not like we're making things worse...

Hm... the ``t_ems_compile_ext_ens`` run also just passed here :-)...

Haha did @cameel magically fix it somehow?

@ekpyron do you still want to split the test you mentioned?

Almost there, I just keep being distracted... it requires a build and an isoltest run and all...

Actually, I was wrong about the test. The first expression is of course valid with this PR, only the second one fails. Just not that easy to see in the test, but it's fine - I'll merge.

I did :) See https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5fca49ca29463f19c672b3da

These tests depend on the repos from https://github.com/solidity-external-tests. @hrkrshnn updated almost all of them but ENS one was still missing a tiny fix so I added it.

Pushing stuff there does not rerun the tests automatically though so the dependency is not all that visible :)
