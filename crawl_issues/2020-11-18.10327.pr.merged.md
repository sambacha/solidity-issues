More explicit description with an example.

Also here documentation is mentioning this is true for memory arrays, so I think you would need to update your example a little bit.

I wanted to make an example for structs, as this is a question I have often heard about. Happy to add one for arrays too. Is that what you mean @mijovic ?

I am not sure if this is best place for example about structs. But, in general this example can be a bit misleading. Storage is divided to slots of 256 bytes. In case of your struct, it will occupy one slot.
The only way to use reminder of that slot is via inline assembly.

But definitely, documentation lacks info on layouts of different types.

I suggest moving this to different location in documentation and using a slight different wording.

I guess you meant 256 bit = 32 bytes.

>  In case of your struct, it will occupy one slot.

The struct occupies 3 slots.

I moved it to a different subsection.

Thanks for your feedback @mijovic .

@ritzdorf Sorry for completely off review. I wasn't fully concentrated.
Thanks for moving it into different section. After fixing few comments on this PR from Chris, I guess it would be good to merge.
