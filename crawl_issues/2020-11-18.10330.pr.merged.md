Note that links were changed in one of the error messages so tests are relevant. Please make sure they passed before merging this.

I noticed that we're sometimes linking to `develop` and sometimes to `latest`. That's pretty inconsistent but I'm not sure which one is better (or if it should depend on the context?). Most links in the code link to `develop` while docs and text files mostly link to `latest`.

The bug list should be taken from develop, everything else should link to latest, I would say.
