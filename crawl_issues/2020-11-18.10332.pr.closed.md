In general: Are getters for public state variables intentionally exempt from both the call graph and its verification?

I don't think getters are too important for now. The following components are planned to use the call graph and none needs support for getters:
 - improved unassigned return variable analysis
 - determine which contracts will be created from this one
 - determine which events and error codes will be used from the current contarct

Smaller case that's even simpler that should also break:
```
contract C {
    constructor() public { f(); }
    function f() internal { g(); }
    function g() internal { }
    function h() external { f(); } // or should also break with: (f)();
}
```

Just to not forget about this: In the last meeting we concluded that it is best to create two independent call graphs for construction time and for post-deploy time.

I have just pushed my updated version of this branch. It's not finished yet but it already passes my extensive test suite so the remaining stuff is just a matter or some cleanup and reorganizing stuff.

What's new:
- A big test suite covering all cases I could think of.
- Events are now added to the graph.
- Public getters are no longer added to the graph.
- Bugfix: modifiers were not being added because they were treated as indirect calls.
- Bugfix: edges leading to functions that were previously visited were not being added.
- Bugfix: edges to dispatch were being added from a function that accesses another function (e.g. assigns it to a pointer) rather than from the one that actually makes the call.

Stuff that still needs to be done:
- [x] Split into separate graphs for creation code and deployed code.
- [x] Tests are failing because `verifyCallGraph()` fails in IR generator in tests. I need to investigate that.
    - I haven't really touched the code outside of `FunctionCallGraph` itself too much. I might have to make some changes there.
- [x] My test suite runs only a few analysis phases. This turned out to be a frequent source of problems and also will get out of sync with `CompilerStack` easily. I should change it to use the graph created by `CompilerStack` instead.
- [x] Functions called from a constructor have edges from `EntryCreation`. I think the edges should be coming from the constructor instead.
- [x] I added `operator <<()` for types I use in tests to `std` namespace for simplicity but that's undefined behavior so it should be moved to another namespace (maybe to `boost::test_tools::tt_detail`).

For now all my changes are in separate commits for ease of review. I will later squash most of them into @Marenz's commits.

EDIT: These issues are now fixed in #10973.

I went through all the comments and marked the ones that have been fixed as resolved. There are actually quite a few that are still relevant. I'll be fixing them now along with the rest of the stuff I mentioned in my previous comment,

This PR has become too big for it's own good and there seem to be problems with discussing some of the older comments. When I have another batch of fixes ready, I'm going to close it and just create a new one.

I'm closing this PR in favor of #10973 which is now down and has fixes for nearly all stuff mentioned in the comments above.

I didn't push any new code here to preserve it so that we can go back to older implementation and comments if needed.
