Why do you think it would be better to generate an assignment without a conversion function?

Because the conversion is a no-op.

There are many conversions that are no-ops.

ok, not just because it's a no-op but because it's a no-op and different from what a simple assignment does. I.e. `uint x = 1` does not add a conversion while `(uint x, uint y) = (1, 1)` does.

I'm actually not 100% sure a conversion between things of the same type is always equivalent to an assignment, I haven't analyzed the conversion function for all types that closely. If it is, the conversion just makes it harder to figure that out. It it's not - why? I'd expect it to behave the same way with and without a tuple.
