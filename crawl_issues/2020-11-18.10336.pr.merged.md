standard_immutable_references/ returns way too much data in the standard json output - maybe someone can investigate?

I don't know if we should add more documentation or not.

A bit maybe? I'd e.g. add:
- All types supported by ABIEncoderV1 are also supported by ABIEncoderV2, but not vice-versa.
- ABIEncoderV2 is safer, since it reverts on malformed inputs, but because of that, it can be more expensive than ABIEncoderV1.

@ekpyron is that an "approve after the commented changes"?

It was a "getting distracted before finishing" :-). But I'll have another quick look, probably fine now.

Needs rebasing in any case, though...

I was assuming they just don't work on breaking right now - but at least the gnosis one is an ABIEncoderV2 stack too deep error, so that's probably indeed very much related to this PR, but on the other hand not very much we can do about it...

I'll paste what I said on gitter:
> - Gnosis fails because of "stack too deep" and I haven't seen it in any other jobs while working on it (neither 0.7.0 nor 0.8.0) so I think this is actual breakage caused by the PR
> - EMS on the other hand fails because of the strict conversions. Something like `Deed(0)` is now illegal. It must be `Deed(address(0))`. I think it was one of the late changes in @hrkrshnn's PR because his original patches in `solidity-external-tests` did not cover it. I have it fixed in my branches though so I will push it to the ones `breaking` uses right now.

So Gnosis is yours, but I'll fix ENS in a moment.

For the record: not even a finished stack limit evader would just solve this right now, because it can't be run on non-yul-IR-codegen-code - and even with Yul IR codegen (if that had a similar stack height issue then), it would be a problem, since the gnosis contracts (IIRC) use memory in inline assembly (which would have to be changed to the new "builtins" or "semi-builtins")... Adding ABI coder v1 pragmas to gnosis would of course work, but if we have to resort to that, I'd actually question if we're ready for this PR at all yet...

I hope that https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/safe-contracts/pull/1 will make the gnosis test work.

Looks like it didn't because we have a system in place specifically to override these settings :)

Looks like Gnosis is still failing to compile. The problem is that the updated upstream version has a new quirk that I forgot about: for some reason it's configured to compile the contracts during JS dependency installation. That's because of [this line in `package.json`](https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/safe-contracts/blob/development/package.json#L39):

```javascript
"prepare": "yarn truffle compile && yarn tnt iN",
```

The problem is that at that point Truffle is still not using the right compiler settings. We can solve it in a few different ways:
- Use `optimize: true` in the compiler settings we set initially (I'd recommend this).
- Patch `package.json` not to compile the contract on its own.
- Patch the optimizer settings like you did in https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/safe-contracts/pull/1.

How exactly does option 1 work? I think it's fine to only test the optimized version.

Basically this: #10520.
