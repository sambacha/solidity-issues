The problem was rebasing an already `breaking` rebased branch (this PR) onto develop again :sweat_smile:

Hmm... Failing tests are not from this PR

Why not include this in develop first?

And can you put the upstream commit hash and URL into the commit log so we can track where it came from?

And it seems the files don't have a license header, so it would be nice to include the upstream license as `test/compilationTests/ens/LICENSE`, like it is for the other imported ones.
