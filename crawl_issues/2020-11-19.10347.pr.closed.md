Hm, so upstream uses truffle. I wonder if we should actually turn this into an external test? In that case we would also test it semantically.

You could try adding it to solidity-external-tests https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/ and write a script similar to `test/externalTests/gnosis.sh` (that should update the pragma) then compile and run tests.

@hrkrshnn Do you know how I can test such a script after I add ens to external tests and before I make a PR?

@bshastry I guess the easiest way is to run it in the CI. I've never compiled soljson myself. What I would do it is to create a repo in external-tests, clone the testing code from `colony.sh` and create `ens.sh`, and add it to `externalTests.sh`.
