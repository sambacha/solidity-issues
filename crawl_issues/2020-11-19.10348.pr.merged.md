# [\#10348 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10348) `merged`: Simplify abstraction of Compiler/CompilerContext/CompilerStack

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-11-19 14:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10348):

Part of #10152.

Basically the motivation here was that if `AssemblyStack.assemble` can return the underlying evmasm object for the EVM case, then we can store the `evmAssembly` and `runtimeEvmAssembly` fields (just like the old codegen does in this PR) and all outputs using them will work.

Not sure we want to do that though, however some of the earlier commits in this PR are still useful to reduce indirection between `Compiler.h` and `CompilerContext.h`.

Let me know.

@chriseth oh forgot to write here, but this waits for your opinion. Read the opener for motivation.
