This first copies the string literal to memory instead of copying it directly to storage, but if we want to improve that, it needs to be fixed in several places at once (we should also check how it is done in the old codegen). Created an issue for that:  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10349

I would not start adding changelog entries for sol->yul yet, it juts creates too much noise.
