# [\#10353 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10353) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Implementing copying dynamically encoded structs from calldata to memory

In this PR we can also activate it for old codegen which will fix #9160

TODO:
- [x] Add more tests as it wasn't implemented for old codegen, so no coverage at all

Added few test with nested structs and structs including arrays. I think coverage should be good now.

Are there any existing tests that could now work with `viaYul: also`?

This is only implemented in sol->yul. I plan to activate it in old codegen via calling yul. So no test to activate unfortunately.

But, I can add more test anyway

Ah ok, sounds good

@leonardoalt Which tests would you suggest I should add?

@cameel @leonardoalt I added bunch of new tests. Do you think there should be even more?

Shouldn't this activate more existing tests?

@mijovic I think it's well covered now. I have nothing to add and I can approve as soon as @leonardoalt's and @chriseth's questions are resolved.

Looks good to me.

@chriseth There were no existing tests because in old codegen this wasn't implemented at all. Only statically encoded structs were supported.
My plan is to in follow-up PR to activate this in old codegen.

Ah right, this only adds dynamic structs!
