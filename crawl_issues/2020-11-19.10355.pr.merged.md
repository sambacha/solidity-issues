# [\#10355 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10355) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Small refactoring of assignments to provide a common low-level point for model checking engines to hook into.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-11-19 21:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10355):

The goal of this PR is to provide a single point in the `SMTEncoder` that handles assigning a new value to a symbolic variable/expression. Such single point can be used by the model checking engines to hook into if they need to customize the behaviour. The plan is to use this in BMC engine to make the assignment conditional based on the path condition.
