Part of #6905.

Feel free to close if disagreeing with it.

I don't see why we shouldn't try enabling all of extra warnings. This looks fine, but looks like some compilers doesn't recognize this option.

Well in #10264 you can see that just enabling conversion warnings triggers a compiler bug ðŸ˜• 

And on this PR it is the same compiler which complains. Cursed ubuntu18.

Maybe GCC on Ubuntu 18 is too old? The flag was added in GCC 8.1 according to [WarningHistory](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/WarningHistory).

Also there used to be some wonky behavior between systems. See for example [-Wextra-semi causes build failure on debian bullseye](https://ea5faa5po25cf7fb.onion.ly/projects/tor/ticket/31769). Hopefully that's fixed now but it may still be an issue with older versions.

Yeah but it is conditionally enabled whether the compiler supports it or not. Just even that fails on ubuntu 18.

Is it a cmake or gcc bug?

Hm, good idea, it may be a shortcoming in the old cmake Ubuntu 18 uses (3.10.2).

`b_ubu_clang` uses clang and cmake 3.16, `b_archlinux` uses gcc and cmake 3.19.

As far as I can tell it should work at least with cmake 3.3+, but Ubuntu 18... so how about if we disable it?

I think we talked about removing Ubuntu 18.04 before? I'd support it. We don't even use the `b_ubu18` build for tests

Rebased and dropped the second commit to see if that fails anywhere.

Tests are passing, I'll just merge this and rebase #10499, removing the workaround there.
