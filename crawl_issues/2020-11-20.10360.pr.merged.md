Can you also add some tests with storage structs, and memory/storage references?

Storage structs I can get by using state variables of type structs, right?
But I am not sure about the memory/storage references...

Yep

This is similar to arrays. Structs are not value type, so the copying/aliasing rules are the same as arrays afaik.

```
struct S { ... }
function f(S storage s) internal ...
function g(S memory s1, S memory s2) ...
```

OK, but how do I test the struct constructor there? Do you mean to have these functions and construct the argument in the function call? That will not work for the function taking `storage` struct, no?

Ah, right... I guess we should already have tests for that, since struct is already supported. This is only about the constructor function call. I think we don't need to add more.

@leonardoalt , @bshastry, thanks for the comments! Anything else? Can I squash this and rebase?
