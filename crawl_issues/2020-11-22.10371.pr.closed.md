Does this replaces #9830? Can we close that?

FYI when I rebased this I also looked at recreating it using https://github.com/axic/keccak-wasm, and while doing so I ended up extending the wasm builtins so that we can avoid some of the manual conversion/rotation opcodes (since they are part of wasm).

Since this issue is not important currently, I'd say we do not review this and circle back in a few weeks perhaps.

Oh, ok. But in that case maybe we could at least decide which way we want to go? If we're going to end up basing this on `keccak-wasm` eventually then maybe we should just close this one and decrease the PR count?

Well, I think this PR is just not really important at the moment, and both of these approaches are costly:
1) This one needs debugging, which is unbounded in time :)
2) The other one needs a conversion script or manual conversion from wast to yul. But at least the code works 100% as we want and is tested to be working (used by other projects).

I can however submit the builtin changes and we can merge it easily next week, which is beneficial to both approaches.

Sounds good.

My impression is that debugging this might be less work but yeah, could also be hellish - I have not written it so I might be misjudging it.

Also, @aarlt used tiny_sha3 for his implementation which the keccak site describes as "simple implementation focused on readability and clarity" and yours is based on rhash. Do you think rhash might be better in terms of performance or have some other advantages? If so, it might indeed make more sense to just spend the time porting it rather than finishing this PR.

Assuming both approaches take the same time, would you choose (2)?

Closing all ewasm PRs since we're not sure about maintaining it any longer.
