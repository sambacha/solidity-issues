# [\#10374 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10374) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Do not report warning when encountered a Type identifier.

Continuing the discussion from #10360, it seems there is no reasoning for SMTChecker to issue a warning when it encounters `Type` identifiers like name of a contract, library or enum. The operations where these identifiers occur are supported by SMTChecker now.
