I think this also needs to modify the circleci config in `.circleci/config.yml`, something similar to `  t_ems_compile_ext_gnosis:` there.

PR updated with new CI jobs for Ens external compilation/tests

Maybe we should not have one ci job for each of the external tests but rather a single job that makes use of parallelism?

I agree. But that's another PR I think

This is weird - it did not actually run any tests, did it?

No, turns out we never ran external tests, we only compiled them. As I look at what seems to be 8 additional CI jobs (4 compile and 4 test), refactoring the test setup to make use of parallelism demands more urgency :sweat_smile:

I think we wanted to move actually running the tests to a nightly run at some point, but maybe it was lost in the process...

Removed testing CI jobs from this PR. Review ready again
