# [\#10389 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10389) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Use nonlinear clauses instead of inlining base constructors in CHC

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-11-24 18:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10389):

CHC currently inlines all base constructors, which won't work for `return` edges.
In preparation for that, this PR replaces the CHC encoding of base constructors to nonlinear clauses "calling" the bases, which might be less efficient but is a lot more elegant in the encoding and well, makes a lot more sense in terms of control flow anyway.
This is fundamentally needed so we can implement `return` in CHC.

This PR still needs a little cleanup, but the core can already be reviewed.

Generally looks good.
Will need to do one more review round, as I used this one to understand the changes and to check some small thinks and style.

Also, I am a bit worried that one test fails only on OSX in `soltest`

The usual nondeterminism I guess...cli also fails with a crash, need to find out what file it is

@mijovic fixed some of your comments, plus also did some refactoring:
- removed everything related to `implicit constructor`, since that's not used anymore
- extracted some constraints into the `initialConstraints` function
- moved the `baseArguments` function into `SMTEncoder`, maybe that can be reused by SMTEncoder itself or BMC

I have one idea for test to add. It shows difference between old codegen and one using ir.
```
contract A {
    uint x;
    constructor() {
        x = 42;
    }
    function f() public returns(uint256) {
        return x;
    }
}
contract B is A {
    uint public y = f();
}
contract C {
    B b = new B();
    function y() public {
        assert(b.y() == 42); // this should fail using oldcodegen and pass with ir
    }
}
```

I know right now SMTChecker should care about old codegen only, but eventually we will use ir by default. This test will be one of the things that would change.
I suggest that we sort these tests somewhere, or write in for of issue in github, or something...

Original test where you can see it is passing via IR is in `constructor_inheritance_init_order.sol`

@mijovic I changed your test to
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract A {
    uint x;
    constructor() {
        x = 42;
    }
    function f() public returns(uint256) {
        return x;
    }
}
contract B is A {
    uint y = f();
}
contract C is B {
    function g() public {
        assert(y == 42); // this should fail using oldcodegen and pass with ir
    }
}
```
because in your test `b.y()` is an external call which would be abstracted with a nondeterministic call. It should be a trusted call since `C` deploys `B`, but we don't have that implemented yet.
In the new version, the assertion does hold already. Is that equivalent to what you meant? Why would the assertion not hold for the old codegen in your example?

@leonardoalt We discussed order of initialization in one old PR and here is commnet about it https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8591#discussion_r405444057 I would expect that assertion fails with old codegen as y is 0 in that case. Anyway, looks like you have implemented in a way that IR does it which I am fine with, but just a note that it is different from what old codegen does.

We will discuss this on a call later I guess

@mijovic updated with your comments + finally fixing the bugs. Now it implements what we talked on Gitter:
- initialize all state variables as 0
- evaluate the base call arguments in the order (most derived) -> (most base)
- construct each contract in the order (most base) -> (most derived)

I also added more tests containing tests for the behavior above, including arguments with side-effects.

Disabled test, let's see
