# [\#10394 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10394) `merged`: Switch compileViaYul to also where appropriate

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-11-25 00:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10394):

A lot of these tests were set to `true` (aka IR-only), which made no sense if it behaves the same on the old codegen.

While all these passed locally, they do not on CI, probably on certain EVM version?

This one I think is because `internal1` and `internal2` are deduplicated in the old codegen but not in the new. Will address:
```
comparison_functions - semanticTests.viaYul

This seems to have some trailing dirty bytes in the old codegen:
```
function_entry_checks - semanticTests.revertStrings

I think these two issues should be investigated, I can take it out to a new PR just to get this large one merged.

Reverted the two problematic ones, lets merge this and discuss those two separately.
