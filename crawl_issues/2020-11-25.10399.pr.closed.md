Even if we want it, probably no need to do it in the first version - but do we still plan on packing the size into the memory object somehow, resp. doing bounds checks *some* way? I'm still not sure about the cost-benefit-ratio of that. On the other hand, without such checks, memory objects can always be circumvented quite easily even if we promoted them to proper types...

Exactly, those are the two questions I've been asking myself: It would be nice to drop the sizes in the builtins.
If we do that, we need
 - to store the size in memory somehow
 - have a similar solution for calldata (if we want to drop the size there, too)
 - provide a way to access slices of memory - and where to store the memory then?

So maybe let's not drop the sizes for now...

I don't think storing the size **in** memory makes sense, because as you say, we couldn't really slice this way...

But just having the 256-bit memory object consist of two 64-bit parts, size in the lowest bits, offset in the next upper bits, would work. And a size of ``0`` would indicate "unbounded".

For calldata we could decide things independently, resp. keep things as they are for now - or is there a need to do it simultanously? I wouldn't see it.

So since as far as I can see that's the only feasible way to deal with sizes anyways, we could also just decide right away - the only question there would be if we expect/consider the shifting and masking that would result from this to be too expensive or not, right?

Actually, a second option (not sure I like it) would be to make memory objects two-stack-slot types...
In any case - it'd be enough progress to get this done without caring about sizes in a first step, that's for sure.

It's an opaque handle, so let's just do it later....

We wanted to reconsider this approach. Closing for now.
