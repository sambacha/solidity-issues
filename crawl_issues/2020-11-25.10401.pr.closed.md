Part of #10405.

Probably the `map<V, set<K>>` should be replaced by something simpler.

Does `InvertibleMap` need to be sorted? Changing `map` to `unordered_map` could also improve speed if not

I'm not sure if unordered_map would be really helpful. Maybe `std::multimap<K, V>` could be better than `std::map<K, std::set<V>>`

Why not? It has better average case complexity for both insertion and search than map

Or `map<K, list<V>>`? The set of references also doesn't need to be sorted

Ah no, you need search for the references too.
Well, maybe `unordered_map<K, unordered_set<V>>` :p

How do they compare for very small size like 5-7 elements? Because that's what we are handling for most of the time.

Another solution (at least in DataFlowAnalyzer) could be to store actual pointers to data directly instead of going through an index structure.

That I don't know. Performance might be very close then. On one hand, the linear worst case of `unordered_map` is not very far from log, but log itself is not very far from const, so...

For the record: removing ``InvertibleMap::references`` altogether and just iterating over all of ``values`` in ``eraseValue`` instead does not have a measurable impact on performance for me.

The same goes for removing ``InvertibleMap::backwards`` and iterating over all forward references instead in ``DataFlowAnalyzer.cpp:L320`` (the only use of ``InvertibleMap::backwards``).

Interesting! is it neither faster nor slower? By the way, the max size was I think 160 or 300 for me.

Depends on the run - sometimes faster, sometimes slower. Just also tried a single ``std::unordered_map<K, V> values;`` in ``InvertibleMap`` (still manually erasing instead of tracking ``references``) - still no difference...
(With a ``YulString`` specialized ``std::hash`` implementation)

Hm... maybe a single forward ``std::unordered_map`` in ``InvertibleRelation`` actually brings some speedup, though...

Ok, well...
Single ``std::unordered_map`` in both ``InvertibleMap`` and ``InvertibleRelation``:
```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m43,635s
user    0m43,250s
sys     0m0,273s
```
vs plain ``develop``:
```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m46,575s
user    0m46,229s
sys     0m0,229s
```
Rather consistently, but not very much.

EDIT: with a single ``std::map`` in both places:

```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m44,639s
user    0m44,319s
sys     0m0,210s
```
Also quite consistently, so this is already a tad faster than the two ``std::map``s, just even less noticable, so I discounted the difference on a single run earlier.

I think we have to find a different solution here that is not just changing the data structures.
