Also attempt to only include ASTForward where appropriate.

So for a long while I hoped we can get rid of the "asm" notion since we moved everything under `libyul`, but it hasn't happened yet. This PR blew up because I thought why not also try to use the forward declaration more, which turned into a feat itself.

I'm not totally convinced it is worth doing all the renaming, but I'm more in favour of renaming `AsmData` to `AST` as it reflects its behaviour much better, and it s good counterpart to `Object` and `libsolidity/AST.h`
