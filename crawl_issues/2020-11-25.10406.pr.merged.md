Need to rebase due to other polyfill changes were merged.

@axic was that an "approve after rebase"?

This is still to do, I think: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10406/files#r532985621

@axic Please review

Ah, tests here are also failing with "Invalid code generated", wondering if it's something common between the 2 PRs

@leonardoalt #10686 uses some features that are not yet ready in ewasm. I just disabled the ewasm execution of these tests.

@cameel Exactly. This PR is a bugfix. The original polyfills where implemented without any real ewasm vm. After we have plugged in hera, we noticed that the endianess was implemented wrong.

@aarlt Ok. I'd suggest renaming in then since the title is the only thing you have for context when starting to review it :)

We should add a test that gets called with a value from the test framework and triggers another call with value to another function. Not sure whether we have such test already.

Still needs rebase.

We discussed this today on the call. This is basically just blocked by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10406#discussion_r532985621 (and also needs a rebase). But we decided that we could just merge it as is and deal with problems later when/if we encounter them.

Removed the sstore and rebased. Since we do not have #10356 merged, I did not try forcing which tests would work now, I think we can do that separately?
