Thanks for your pull request! Since this is a breaking change, can you please make it relative to the `breaking` branch? And could you also add something to `Changelog.md`?

By the way, if you change `The PR covers #10276.` to `The PR fixes #10276.` in your top comment, github will close the original issue automatically when this is merged.

Oh, Thx! Didn't know that :)

Should we have at least a single commandlineTest for this?

I thought about that but I'm not sure it would be useful. This output is pretty long and hairy so there's a high chance the someone seeing it change will just shrug and replace it with a new version without reading much into it.

A boost test would be useful but again, we don't have that for CLI. We really need #5303.

Though maybe such a test still better than nothing?

@ssi91 Could you squash your commits? Multiple commits are fine when there are distinct changes but there's no need to have them just for review fixes.

The changes themselves are fine so I'm going to approve this once tests pass, i.e. once the breakage in `breaking` is fixed and this is rebased on the fix.

How come this change resulted in no test changes? Should have added CLI tests for `--combined-json`.

The CLI coverage is very sparse. I don't think `--combined-json` is covered by tests at all.

I accepted the PR without it because I personally don't think a command-line test for this would provide much value (maybe better than nothing but still not much) but I can add one if you think it's better to have it.
