Can you briefly explain why? Not sure I intuitively understand why this is good

`clearValues` clears the values and associations for variables when there is an asignment. Example:

```
let a := 5
let b := a
a := 7
```

After `let b := a`, we store that `b` references `a`. At `a := 7` we have to clear the value of `b` (because `b` is not equal to `a` anymore), but also the value of `a`.

In contrast, at `let a := 5`, there is nothing to clear because we are just introducing the variable.
