A new name created by NameSimplifier could also be created by NameDispenser, since the knowledge of
the new name was not stored in NameSimplifier.

> Can you add a test that would fail before this change?

@cameel That won't be easy. Let me try to see if I can create one. I think the failures in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10418 are because of this. The tests there would pass after making this change.

Actually I think we should take the name simplifier out of the steps available to users.

I did some refactoring that removes `m_usedNames` and make the step rely on `NameDispenser`. Also removed NameSimplifier from steps available to users.
