Tests are failing but this looks like something unrelated to this PR. Probably another thing that broke on `breaking`.

It's our detector for tests that work with the new Yul-based backend but are not marked as such. Apparently `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/arithmetics/check_var_init.sol` did not work with that backend but now does.

All you have to do is to add this in that test (look how other tests in the same directory do it):
```
// ====
// compileViaYul: also
```

Here's the commit that added that test: c9ef727136a5aed0b2e1fec787abdbdd6bd57b0a

You can see how some tests have `compileViaYul: also` while others don't.

Thanks @ssi91!
It's merged. Now you can rebase #10409 on it.
