## Abstract

Add new modifier for functions which are allowed to make STATICCALLs and SSTORE, but denied to make CALLs and DELEGATECALLs. This modifier would allow having compile-time protection similar to `nonReentrant` modifier functionality for 0 gas cost.

## Motivation

Reentrancy is such a terrific attack surface for smart contracts that many developers add `nonReentrant`, `_lock_` and even [`_viewlock_`](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-core/blob/master/contracts/BPool.sol#L131) modifiers to all the methods. It would be great to have 0 gas cost compile-time check that some method is not vulnerable to reentrancy because do not produce any non-view externals call.

## Specification

Use keyword `writeonly` or `reentracySafe` or any other for this modificator.

## Backwards Compatibility

Fully compatible since restricts the only subset of non-view functions.

So this would basically be a new mutability level called `writeonly` (or `reentrancySafe` but this does not really fit the current set of names) that would sit between `view` and the current default where the state is completely mutable? 

What do you think about @axic's proposal from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9248#issuecomment-713884387 that would introduce a `state()` modifier that would allow more granular control than the current set of mutability levels. If we combined it with your proposal, it could include a `call` permission and then you would have to explicitly define a function like this if you wanted to allow reentrancy:
```solidity
function f() state(read, write, call) {}
```

@cameel this would work if we would have permissions:
- read
- write
- call
- viewcall
- delegatecall
- codecall
- create

@k06a isn't your list a bit too fine-grained? Shouldn't the following be sufficient:
 - direct state modification (via sstore)
 - indirect state modification (via call, delegatecall, create, ...)
 - send ether

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
