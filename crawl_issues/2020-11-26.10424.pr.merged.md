# [\#10424 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10424) `merged`: Add unimplemented assert for modifiers in the IR

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-11-26 22:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10424):

Part of #10413.

Since currently code using modifiers (both in constructors and functions) will result in miscompiled output, it is better to put this assertion in.

Should squash before merging.
