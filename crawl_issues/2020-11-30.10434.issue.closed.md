## Abstract

I think, Solidity should learn something from TypeScript and new ECMAScript. Especially its modifier and function definition in contract.

## Motivation

- Help the code more clean and realizable 
- Separate builtin modifiers: `public`, `external`, `private`, `internal`, `virtual`, `pure`, `view` and self-defined modifiers
- Remove `function` keyword 

## Specification

Method in contract could be define following this syntax:

```
<visible> [mutable] [override] <methodName>([params]) returns([results])
```

- visible: `public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`
- mutable: `view`, `pure`
- override: `virtual`

E.g:

```
contract TestContract {
    internal view virtual getAddress(uint256 index) returns(address newAddresss) {}
    external pure calcuateRate() onlyWhitelisted returns(uint256) {}
}
```

Solidity wasn't allowed functional programming , so keyword `function` won't be defined outside of `contract {}`, `interface {}`. That make no sense to keep `function` keyword meanwhile visible is the most important thing and builtin modifiers should to be separated from self-defined modifiers.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatible

Since a handful of releases functions outside of contracts are actually allowed.

How about rearrange modifiers and remove function keyword in contract body?. Does it worth to be considered?.

I think it definitely makes sense to consider it, but needs input from more people.

I suggest to also give a look to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9248#issuecomment-713884387, which is a different proposal hopefully improving the visibility of these specifiers.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
