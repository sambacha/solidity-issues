# [\#10442 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10442) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Adding support for public getters on `this`

This PR adds support for precise analysis of public getters on `this` contract.
Previously these calls were abstracted away in the analysis.
In this PR we treat calls to the getter as an access to the state variable, including the special case of `mapping`s and `array`s where the getter requires parameters corresponding to the index access.

Resolves #10285.
