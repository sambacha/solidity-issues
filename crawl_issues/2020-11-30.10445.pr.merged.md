# [\#10445 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10445) `merged`: [Sol->Yul] Implement function modifiers.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-11-30 18:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10445):

Fixes #10413.

This PR implements modifiers in a slightly different way than the old code generator.
Each modifier is wrapped into its own function and there is an "inner" function containing the actual function code (if the function has modifiers).

The generated code roughly has the following format:

```
function f(x, y) -> z {
  z := mod_m(x, y)
}
function mod_m(x, y) -> z {
  if gt(x, 2) {
    z := f_inner(x, y)
  }
}
function f_inner(x, y) -> z {
  z:= add(x, y)
}
```

In the old code generator, function parameters and return variables have a fixed place on the stack and modifier code is copied into the function. The main difference now is cases where the actual function is included multiple times (either by using `_` inside a loop or by using multiple `_` per modifier). In the old code generator, the function parameters would reference the same stack slots and would live on until after the function including modifiers exits. This means using `_a++` on a parameter would have an effect on the second time the function's body is included.

```
contract c {
  modifier m() { for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) _; }
  function f(uint a) m returns (x) { x = ++a; }
}
```

In the old codegen, the above code would return `10` while in the new one it returns `1`.


One problem that is not yet solved by this PR is that of how to initialize return variables. If we return memory structures, they have to be initialized at all times. The proper way would be to initialize them at the very outer function and pass them in through the call chain, but this causes a rather high variable pressure.

TODO:
 - [x]  more tests
 - [x]  document differences
 - [x] solve return variable init problem

Can you please add 
```
// ====
// compileViaYul: false
```
to tests that are not going to work via `ir`, for exampe `function_modifier_multi_invocation.sol`, `function_modifier_multi_with_return.sol`, `function_modifier_loop.sol`, and possibly some other...

It is not a big deal for this PR, but will help making #10546 possible

None of the tests had recursive functions. Maybe a recursive function that uses modifiers can be added?
