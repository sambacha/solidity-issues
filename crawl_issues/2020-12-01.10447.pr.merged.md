# [\#10447 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10447) `merged`: Replace the inconsistent use of u160/Address/h160 with h160 only

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-12-01 00:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10447):

Part of #7794.

Prior to this change tests used a mixture of h160/u160/Address and various ways to pad/truncate.

Should squash before merging.

I would actually prefer to keep Address.

That would mean we need to put into some common header so that all the tests can use it. Because what this PR does not show is the other 50% of the use cases had `h160` already.

If we do a mass-rename to `Address` is that throughout the project or only in the tests?

Whatever is an address should have type Address.

So define it in `CommonData`  next to `u256` and use it everywhere?

@chriseth didn't do the renaming in `tests/`, but the last commit shows what a generic `Address` type would look like. I guess then we could replace `FixedHash` with a simplified implementation later?

Also how about having `Bytes32` instead of `h256`?

Looks good!
