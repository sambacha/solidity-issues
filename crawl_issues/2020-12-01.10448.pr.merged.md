# [\#10448 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10448) `merged`: Add comprehensive tests for FixedHash

Part of #7794.

I have various branches removing features from FixedHash, tried to merge them here, but I think it will be easier to progress if we argue about them in separate PRs. Examples:
- remove support for `FixedHash<0>`
- removing the `bytesConstRef` constructor
- removing indexing operator (and changing the `ostream` to use `hex()` simply) -- if we keep it, it should do a runtime error on out of bounds
- change what happens when input is too short / too large (currently it just sets the hash to zeroes)

```
/root/project/libsolutil/FixedHash.h:169:25: error: comparison of unsigned expression in ‘< 0’ is always false [-Werror=type-limits]
  169 |  for (unsigned i = 0; i < N; ++i)
      |                       ~~^~~
```

Would anyone argue removing support for `FixedHash<0>` in this PR? (e.g. by adding a `static_assert` in the constructor)

Ah, I only realize now **why** you want to disallow ``FixedHash<0>``. Yeah, makes sense! Effectively the tests show that it already *is* disallowed anyways.

Builds are failing. Not sure if it just needs rebasing or fixing

Tests are failing because as @ekpyron said `FixedHash<0>` is already implicitly disallowed by newly added tests
