Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10435

I propose to disallow `type(super)` because it just creates too many problems if there is no other contract higher up in the inheritance chain.

We do have extensive tests of that feature, though. So maybe it's better to create an error if the super type does not exist? The problem is that this depends on the most derived contract and thus when compiling a contract in isolation it can likely fail but succeed when used properly in its inheritance hierarchy.

`type(super).name` was implemented on purpose. Although I'm not sure if it's of much use, other than for testing. Isn't it just possible for the typechecker to see if super type exist when `type(super)` is used?

Example:
```
contract c {
  function f() public pure returns (string memory) {
    return type(super.name);
  }
}
contract b {}
contract d is b ,c {}
contract e is c. b {}
```
When you compile any of the contracts except e (or maybe d, I can never remember the order), contract c is invalid.

So I see the following solution:
 - remove `name` from `type(super)` if the most derived contract is not abstract and there is no super contract.

Acutally thinkign about it: `super` is not a single contract. `super.f` is the declaration of `f` one level higher up in the chain. The problem is that `super.g` and `super.f` might be functions in different contracts not even related to each other in terms of inheritance. Assigning a single name to `super` gives a different impression, though.

@ekpyron it will not conflict, it is based on top of it.

Tests are failing because of name_other_contract.

Rebased.
