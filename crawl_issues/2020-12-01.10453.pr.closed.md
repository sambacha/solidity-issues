Closing this PR since there seems to be a consensus on the use of branches for testing

Since tests are broken on `breaking` now due to it not running on the 0.8.x branch and I think this change would fix it I'm going to try to take over this PR and rebase it on breaking instead.

Doesn't work. Looks like the 0.8.0 branch still needs some tweaks.

I figured out the problem but I'm submitting it as a separate PR: #10468.

I'm closing this one after all to avoid creating more confusion since it was originally meant only to change the branch and this ended up not working (and not being necessary).
