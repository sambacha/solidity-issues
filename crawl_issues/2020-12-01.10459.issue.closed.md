**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

If I move this check to `storeInMemoryDynamic` then this fails:
```
semanticTests/various/literal_empty_string.sol: FAIL
  Contract:
    contract C {
        bytes32 public x;
        uint256 public a;
    
        function f(bytes32 _x, uint256 _a) public {
            x = _x;
            a = _a;
        }
    
        function g() public {
            this.f("", 2);
        }
    }
    
    // ====
    // compileViaYul: also

  Expected result:
  // x() -> 0
  // a() -> 0
  // g() ->
  // x() -> 0
  // a() -> 2

  Obtained result:
  // x() -> 0
  // a() -> 0
  // g() -> FAILURE
  Warning: The call to "g()" returned 

  // x() -> 0
  // a() -> 0
  Warning: The call to "a()" returned 
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
  
  Attention: Updates on the test will apply the detected format displayed.
  
  Note that the test also has to pass via Yul.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
