# [\#10460 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10460) `merged`: Deterministic function order in internal dispatch

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-01 16:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10460):

This adds a custom comparator to `std::set<FunctionDefinition const*>` to make the order depend on function ID rather than the layout of `FunctionDefinition` objects in memory.

This is not completely deterministic but good enough for now.
See https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5fc655b030c9c144c64f2202:
> I think sorting by function IDs (which at some later point do not have to be AST IDs) is a good solution
> AST IDs are somewhat determinsitic
> they do not depend on the memory layout of the machine the compiler runs on, as ast pointers do
> but they depend on whether or not some unused source files are supplied to the compiler
> so if you run `solc a.sol b.sol`, it can result in different bytecode than just running `solc b.sol`
> we should really try to avoid that, but it's not always possible
> at least I was not able to find a complete fix

I'm getting some test failures locally: `semanticTests/revertStrings/empty_v1` and `semanticTests/abiEncoderV1/abi_encode_empty_string`. Looks unrelated to my PR. Is `develop` broken or did I introduce some subtle breakage with my changes?

EDIT: Actually, it's probably caused by the fact that I pulled `develop` during the test run. But let's make sure the tests pass here fully before merging to be safe.

Tests passed after all.
