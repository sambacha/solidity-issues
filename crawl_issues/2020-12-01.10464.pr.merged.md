**This PR depends on #10468 and should be merged after it.**

I noticed that we have a big shellcheck ignore list which includes these scripts among other things. Here's a small step towards removing it.

Is this change needed for the tests or is this just a refactor?

It's not needed for tests to work but I added a new script and the shellcheck CI job started failing. I had a choice of either adding the script to shellcheck ignore list or fixing the stuff shellcheck reports. I decided to do the latter so in a way this PR is a fix needed for #10429 to pass all tests - but again not the most minimal possible fix. If there's an actual need I can always rebase #10429 directly on `develop` and just add the ignore instead.

Merged.

I'd rather keep the commits unless there's a good reason not to (e.g. they are messy or just random PR fixes that should logically be part of the original commits). I specifically keep such refactoring changes separate because then it's easier to see the reason behind each one. I really wish it was done that way in `solidity-external-tests`. Rebasing them (and understanding conflicts) would be much easier.
