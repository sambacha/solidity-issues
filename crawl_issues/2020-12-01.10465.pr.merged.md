~**This PR depends on #10429 and should be merged after it and after `develop` is then merged into `breaking`.**~
~Currently this PR includes copies of all commits from #10429 and #10464 because those PRs are not on `breaking` yet. I'm going to rebase it and remove the copies once  they're merged.~
This is on breaking now and ready for review + merge.

An integral part of this PR is the update of `solidity-external-tests` repos. All changes are pretty minor updates over the `070` variants (mostly cherry-picked from @hrkrshnn's commits). The big ones were all in #10429.

One thing that I just papered over rather than fixed are the revert reasons for safe math errors. See https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/colonyNetwork/commit/e23fd1d68a2a12b215cf6fa2c30162828f0acf35. Colony has tests that verify that the errors are specifically those from `DSMath` and on 0.8.0 it's no longer true - panic codes are returned instead. web3.js seems unable to handle them though. I expected that it would a least return raw hex values of the stuff returned by revert or something but it just returns `undefined`.
