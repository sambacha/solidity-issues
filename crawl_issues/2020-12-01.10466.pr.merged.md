# [\#10466 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10466) `merged`: Running external tests nightly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-01 23:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10466):

Fixes #10397.

**This PR depends on #10429 and should be merged after it.**

This is just cleanup after #10429:
- Converts the external test jobs from PR checks to nightly jobs.
- Re-enables gitter notifications which are too spammy in PR checks but useful for nightly jobs.
- ~Switches back to the usual branches from `solidity-external-tests`. #10429 was made to run on branches suffixed with `_new` (e.g. `develop_070_new`) to avoid breaking tests on `develop` in the meantime.~ EDIT: This is now a separate PR: #10500.

Updated so that only the tests that take > 15 minutes run nightly.

Last time I checked, the timings were:
- Gnosis v2: 2 min
- ENS: 3 min
- Gnosis v1: 10 min
- OpenZeppelin: 12 min
- Colony: 44 min
