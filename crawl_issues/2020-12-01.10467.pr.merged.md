Part of #10405

I'm not necessarily saying that any of this is a particularly good idea :-)...
But with this I get a speedup of almost 15% on a RelWithDebInfo build:

develop:
```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m47,327s
user    0m46,901s
sys     0m0,294s
```

this branch:
```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m40,649s
user    0m40,286s
sys     0m0,259s
```

But I'm not sure how much further one can get with micro-optimizations like this.

The most expensive remaining part when I profile this branch is ``DataFlowAnalyzer::handleAssignment``, so if there is much further to be done that's where to look.

We'll probably merge some version at some point, but some comments etc. still need to be addressed. My plan was to take care of this one tomorrow.

It would be nice, if someone tried to confirm that I'm right in that not clearing back-references when popping scopes is fine, since we check for variables being in scope on the user end (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10467#discussion_r533790328)

Nobody had another look at this ;-)? I just rebased it now, but it should still work unchanged and is still ready for review.

By the way: the numbers have slightly changed since last time I measured - apparently ``develop`` has regressed a bit further performance-wise.
I now get on develop:
```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m55,125s
user    0m54,665s
sys     0m0,233s
```

vs. on this branch:

```
$ time { for i in $(seq 10); do build/test/tools/isoltest -t sem*/via* --optimize &> /dev/null ; done;}

real    0m47,796s
user    0m47,389s
sys     0m0,266s
```

which is still not much, but still roughly 15% speedup.

EDIT: also since @hrkrshnn asked: actually in the latest version changing the ``unordered_map``s back to regular ``map``s also does not make a huge difference, but it's a few percent slower, so since I don't see a reason for not using ``unordered_map``s I'd keep them.

Haven't reviewed this in detail, but I'm not so sure about unordered_map. Can it be system-dependent? Also, about the performance comparisons: Please take into account that if you use isoltest, you are running this on many small files, which is not what we should optimize for.

Yeah, sure - it'd be nice to have a better set of sources to compare against... do we have that or want to come up with one?

About ``unordered_map``: do you mean whether the actual order in it is implementation-dependent or the performance? I guess for both the answer is yes, but nothing in the PR should depend on that order (I hope at least :-)).

That being said we might as well switch back to ``map`` - it doesn't make a huge difference in the last version of the PR.

The deposit contract test case was merged, that is a good one to start with (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts/deposit_contract.sol)

That it is, but we'll also get like 14% if we'd replace ``std::unordered_map`` with ``std::map`` and left anything else as is in this PR.

```
$ time { for i in $(seq 100); do  buildOptimized/solc/solc --experimental-via-ir --optimize test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts/deposit_contract.sol &> /dev/null ; done ; }

real    0m30,724s

Rather consistent with the other measurements. But one contract doesn't really make for a good test set ;-).

Well you can pick from #10390.

@hrkrshnn asked me to run https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/24818ae3ed9f1c6f04239f1765900501, so here:
```
$ time { for in in $(seq 10); do build/solc/solc --optimize --ir-optimized DexConstraintPoly.sol &> /dev/null ; done ; }

real    1m7,018s
user    1m6,774s
sys     0m0,123s

$ time { for in in $(seq 10); do buildOptimized/solc/solc --optimize --ir-optimized DexConstraintPoly.sol &> /dev/null ; done ; }

real    1m4,477s
user    1m4,216s
sys     0m0,140s
```

That's significantly less improvement, but @hrkrshnn also already pointed out that the file doesn't have a lot of control flow.
