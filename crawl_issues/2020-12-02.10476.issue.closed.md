Right now the ewasm tests are not running with `--optimize`, due to the following problem:

```
Executing with wabt...
[0] getCallValue 0
[0] codeCopy 40 d0 1f78
[0] finish 40 1f78
wabt (verifyContract): type mismatch in local.set, expected [i64] but got [i32]
wabt (verifyContract): OnLocalSetExpr callback failed
Module failed to load.
```

I thought #8240 fixed this, but perhaps it was the one introducing it? :)

It seems that builtins returning i32 are still considered i64 for some reason, i.e. 
```
    (import "ethereum" "getCallDataSize" (func $eth.getCallDataSize (result i32)))
...
    (local $_1 i64)
...
            (local.set $_1 (call $calldatasize_2126))
```

Or the other possibility is that locals are all defined as i64.

I think the problem may be that `TypeInfo` is used for tracking types of locals, but that only works on fully disambiguated sources and in wasm after the polyfill that requirement is not fulfilled.

We're closing all wasm issues for now.
