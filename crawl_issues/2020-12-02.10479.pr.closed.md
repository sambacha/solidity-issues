Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6728

This turns 
```
contract C {
  struct S { uint16 a; uint16 b; uint16 c;}
  S s;
  function f() public {
    s = S(1,2,3);
  }
}
```

into
```
sstore(_1, or(and(or(and(or(and(sload(_1), not(65535)), 0x01), not(0xffff0000)), 131072), not(0xffff00000000)), 0x0300000000))
```

(The unoptimized IR has three function calls that each perform an sstore)

The single sload is still needed. I'm not sure how it would look if the storage slot would be completely filled, but I guess it would not be able to reason that all bits are overwritten.

The good thing here is also that, in contrast to the old codegen/optimizer, it does not matter whether you use `s = S(1,2,3)` or `s.a = 1; s.b = 2; s.c = 3;` or even `s.a = 1; s.b = aFunctionThatDoesNotAccessStorage(); s.c = 3;`

Should check https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9831

I can check if it helps with #9831

I checked copying storage structs, and it does not always work because the inliner fails to inline the right functions. We might put a weight to enforce inlining of functions that are expensive to execute but small in comparison.

I did a rebase to latest develop, wanted to rebase one of my branches over this one to check gas costs

I have the feeling that this is horribly slow due to the data flow analyzer.

I think `DataFlowAnalyzer` is not too slow if everything is in SSA.

The main problem with this PR is that it is wrong - see one of the new tests: We cannot remove stores if there was an `sload` from it after it has been overwritten, and this is not tested here.

Closing this in favour of the mechanism described in https://hackmd.io/jWoLK7ccTHeIYXEGMayHXQ?both
