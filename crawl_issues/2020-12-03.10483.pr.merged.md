# [\#10483 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10483) `merged`: Experimental mechanism for loading Z3 dynamically at runtime.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-12-03 01:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10483):

Ok, so this is as close as we will get.
The "static" binary built by the ``b_ubu_static`` CI here now dynamically loads Z3 - it's available as CI artifact ~~(https://531866-40892817-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/solc).~~ [Link doesn't seem to work]

The resulting binary is in fact slightly (but insignificantly) smaller than the previous static build. However, it's not entirely static anymore:
```
$ ldd /tmp/solc
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffebdbf2000)
        libdl.so.2 => /usr/lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f0ff38c7000)
        libm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007f0ff3781000)
        libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f0ff35b8000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0ff43e3000)
```

I was strongly arguing for trying to achive *entirely* static binaries before today, but ;-)... all what remains here ``libdl.so``, ``libm.so`` and ``libc.so`` are all part of ``glibc``. The binary should work as is against any glibc>=2.14 (released 2011). Some further minor trickery could even make it compatible down to glibc>=2.4 (released 2006) - beyond that it might be a hassle. Newer versions of glibc released in the future can reasonably be expected to stay compatible basically forever.

So this is not entirely what we wanted, but I'm not sure it's all too bad.

The reason for entirely static linking not being possible is the fact that Z3 uses some thread-local storage variables and thread-local storage inherently depends on the dynamic linker and seems to work fundamentally different between static and dynamic linking - and to me it doesn't look like there is any workaround for that.

The PR is of course still draft, so not much sense to review the details, it's rather meant as proof-of-concept - e.g. we won't pull in the actual Z3 headers, but make them compile-time-only dependencies and also the CMake options need some refinement (e.g. errors for trying to do any of this on non-linux systems), etc.
On the other hand, note that there are hardly any changes to the existing code - the only real change is adding ``Z3Interface::available()``, the rest is entirely transparent.

Apart from all that, all tests were passed with this kind of linking and there is no noticable performance loss.

So yeah, opinions anyone :-)?

This is actually nice.
I'm wondering whether it not being `entirely static` anymore has any drawbacks

The drawbacks I can think of are:
- If anyone tries to run the binary on a more-than-a-decade-old linux distribution, they won't work. As mentioned above, without modification the binary should start working from systems ~2011 - the oldest ubuntu docker image I found is 14.10 and the binary immediately works there.
- If out of the blue glibc decided to introduce the first real forward-incompatible change since 1997 (actually I think there's even compatibility wrappers for even older ones), then the binaries will *stop* working.
- Exotic embedded systems that don't come with ``glibc``, but an embedded variant may have issues. But those are used to having to rebuild everything anyways because of it.

So there *are* downsides, but I'm not sure they are all that horrible. Am I missing any?

I think those are fine, especially because we would see them before releasing (well, 1 we know statically, so this is more related to 2)

The thing is rather that old historic binaries would stop working with 2 and we'd have to rebuild them. But I'd be surprised if 2 happened without any compatibility wrapper as long as x86_64 lives...

Alpine, probably. Though I'm not sure - it has `musl` by default but maybe it's possible to install `glibc` there too if you need it?

I tried it in Docker and I am getting errors. Here's how to reproduce.

#### Get the container and executables
```bash
mkdir /tmp/alpine/
cd /tmp/alpine/
docker pull alpine
curl -OL https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.7.5/solc-static-linux
curl -L https://532552-40892817-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/solc --output solc-dynamic
chmod +x solc-static-linux solc-dynamic
```

#### Static build of 0.7.5
```bash
docker run -it --rm --volume /tmp/alpine:/tmp/ alpine ldd /tmp/solc-static-linux
docker run -it --rm --volume /tmp/alpine:/tmp/ alpine /tmp/solc-static-linux --version
```

Output:
```

The one I downloaded from [most recent run of `b_ubu_static` (finished ~6h ago)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/11055/workflows/badb0719-cf4a-4db1-a73c-e155355b05ec/jobs/532552/artifacts) segfaults on Arch Linux without Z3:
```
sudo pacman -Rsc z3 --noconfirm
./solc-dynamic test/libsolidity/smtCheckerTests/bmc_coverage/assert.sol
```
```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
Works when Z3 is installed.

Is it **that** exotic though? We've been still using it for building not that long ago. And I generally use it for containers if I can get away with it because it's very lightweight.

Yes, it is :-). At least thinking of it as a distribution that you run, download software into and expect that to run. And it was also rather exotic that we built it in those before :-). And in general a container like that is expected to build it's own stuff and can't expect anything to just work in it. If we continue to build a docker image (do we still do that?), then that'll be a different build. So to me at least this seems to be of rather limited concern in general.

Let me look at the segfaulting thing, I probably messed something up in the force pushes...

Actually, looks like it only fails on specific tests. It does not segfault on `smtCheckerTests/simple/smoke_test.sol`. And our static Linux binary for 0.7.5 crashes on the same test so it's most likely not caused by dynamic linking. 0.7.4 and earlier work fine so it's probably a SMTChecker bug.

@leonardoalt Has `smtCheckerTests/bmc_coverage/assert.sol` failing on 0.7.5 already been reported somewhere or should I file a new one?

It doesn't on Arch!
@xwvvvvwx reported that it also happens on NixOS, but I could not reproduce that on Arch, neither on Ubuntu.

The discussion about Z3 went [here](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5fc946e1ff927f50824b64fe) in case anyone wants to follow.

Anyway, back to the static binaries - I agree that Alpine is not a distro you where you should expect everything to work out of the box and is generally different from the others but my point was that its use is widespread in some niches (i.e containerized services) so I wouldn't really consider it very exotic. It's mostly whether we see value in these static binaries being extra portable or is it just a workaround for outdated libraries.

Yeah, I only meant exotic when thought of as being used as proper distribution. And anything that isn't to me doesn't really seem to be the target of the releases. But one can for sure argue about it. To me it seems fine.

And more importantly: dynamically linked :-)! Even to boost... actually if this PR goes through that package there would work against their z3 package, if both are installed (that actually works - in the process of trying to get entirely-static plus dlopen I actually tried building everything based on musl libc - the dlopen mechanism works just fine there, but only if both parties are dynamically linked as well)

@leonardoalt Somehow github didn't let me respond to that comment above.
This will replace linking for the static github release build, so that's where those options are needed - everything else will still link regularly - so not sure *what else*?

Ok!

For the record: I found a ubuntu 10.04 docker image with comes with glibc-2.11, which is too old. As expected, on that the release binaries won't work, I get:
```

glibc 2.14 was released 2011-06-01 (https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Glibc%20Timeline)

The build is done with z3 4.8.9.
I installed z3 4.8.7 locally and
`/usr/local/lib/libz3.so.4.8.7.0` is the actual installed lib, with symbolic links `/usr/local/lib/libz3.so.4.8 -> libz3.so.4.8.7.0` and `/usr/local/lib/libz3.so -> libz3.so.4.8`.
When I use
- `libz3.so.4.8.7.0` I get `Warning: CHC analysis was not possible since libz3.so.4.8 was not found.`
- `libz3.so.4.8.7` I get `Warning: CHC analysis was not possible since libz3.so.4.8 was not found.`
- `libz3.so.4.8` works
- `libz3.so.4` works
- `libz3.so` works

The above is not a problem if the symbolic links are there, but shouldn't we look for `4.8.X.Y` in the loop?

Not sure I got you right there, especially what you mean by ``When I use``. Do you mean you remove all symbolic links except the ones mentioned in the list? Then the behavior is exactly right. If you build against 4.8.9.0, then it'll look for

libz3.so.4.8.9.0
libz3.so.4.8.9
libz3.so.4.8
libz3.so.4
libz3.so

It won't find ``libz3.so.4.8.7.0``, if there's no ``libz3.so.4.8`` nor ``libz3.so.4`` nor ``libz3.so`` symlinks to it.
But that's pretty much how so-versions are supposed to work, isn't it?
In practice you'll always have the symlinks.

I mean: it would also be fine to make things simpler and just only ever look for and open ``libz3.so.<buildTimeMajor>.<buildTimeMinor>`` and nothing else. Arguably, that'd even be the more standard behavior...

That is: "normal" shared linking will end up like this:
```
$ ldd /usr/bin/solc 
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff45fd6000)
        libz3.so.4.8 => /usr/lib/libz3.so.4.8 (0x00007f5b36be3000)
...
```
So it'll only ever work, if a ``libz3.so.4.8`` symlink is there. I could make the dynamic loading do just the same.

`libz3.so.4.8.7.0` is the real file. If the symlinks are not there the lib is not found.

Yeah, just pushed that - the loop made more sense when we stayed more (resp. too) permissive - since we'll end up rejecting anything that doesn't report the correct major & minor versions anyways, we might as well not even try to load them (since we can expect those symlinks to always be there - and actually if you have multiple patch versions installed and switch between symlinking one or the other to ``libz3.so.4.8`` you probably expect us to load whatever the symlink says, not what happens to have been the one used for building, just like regular non-dlopen builds would).

Curious - I was sure I bumped the docs as well earlier, but apparently I was imagining that or it was somehow lost again. Pushed it now.

Alright - I also simultanously just squashed it (ping @leonardoalt).

And yeah, I see the point about the template, but to me it still seems nicer to have everything in one file - it's not like it's exceedingly complex python logic there, and this way you don't need to switch files to get an idea of what's going to be generated there... but yeah, thanks for approving it like this contrary to your preference then ;-).
