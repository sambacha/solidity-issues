This might be somewhat tool-breaking... but maybe not and maybe not a big deal...

The external tests are failing somewhere in the [`try..catch` block in Truffle that runs the compiler](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/v5.0.41/packages/workflow-compile/legacy/index.js#L46-L70).

It does look like Truffle is trying to access one of the fields and getting `undefined` instead but since the block catches and re-raises the error (losing the stack trace in the process) it's hard to see where exactly it happens.

If you want to see if updating Truffle fixes it, you could try to temporarily rebase the branch on top of #10429 and see if the test passes then.

@ekpyron It should not be a breaking change, it just properly implements what is stated in the documentation.
