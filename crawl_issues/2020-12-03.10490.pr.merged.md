@leonardoalt , this is a quick fix for the issue, but there are some things to discuss.
Also I will try to add more tests for the conversion, especially to `FixedBytes` with less bytes than present in the string literal.

@leonardoalt I have detected and fixed another issue regarding casting string literal to `bytes` and added a couple of assertions to the tests regarding bitwise operations on `FixedBytes`.
Those seem to be correct, the problems were in the typecasts.
