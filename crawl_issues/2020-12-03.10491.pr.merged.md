@chriseth is this about the amount you want to have extracted here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10467#discussion_r534035494 ?
Or are the casted-enum-index-lookups into the member arrays already a bit over the top? If so I can dial it down a bit:-)...

Actually I embarrassingly also forgot to actually fill the members in the ``DataFlowAnalyzer`` constructor... upcoming in a second...
