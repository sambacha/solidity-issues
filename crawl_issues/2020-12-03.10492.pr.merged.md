Does this bug also affect non-value array copying?

Non-value array copying wasn't affected. This was only the case with arrays of value types smaller than 32 bytes (with different base types). But, speaking of which I am not sure if we have tests with nested arrays with such types, so should be added here in any case...

so for example:
```
byte[][] a;
bytes2[][] b;

...

b = a;
```

I updated with fixes. I did it in different commits for easier review.

Left to be done is to add more tests.

is this activating all the remaining tests in test/libsolidity/semanticTests/array/copying ?

There is only one left:
`array/copying/storage_memory_nested_bytes`(this needs #10560, and probably something else)  and `storage_memory_nested_struct` which is implemented by #10552

Once I am done with these PRs will probably fast activate the last one.

Just to mention, there are test working viaYul only in that directory :-)
