By the way I think this situation is entirely untested.
I think we should definitely at least have the static release binary compile all test files, including SMT ones, to check for crashes.
And in general the behavior of builds without SMT solvers on SMT-enabled sources needs more tests, since our test case just skips them in that case. It should probably rather just ignore the expectations instead.

Wait a second, there may indeed by another way to do this...

@leonardoalt Yeah, this works as well, and I guess this was the original idea in this, right?

I can confirm that `b_ubu_static` does not crash on my system with `test/libsolidity/smtCheckerTests/bmc_coverage/assert.sol`.
