# [\#10499 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10499) `merged`: Drop direct support for Ubuntu 18.04 and switch to static PPA releases for it.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2020-12-04 16:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10499):

The only "concern" here is that we won't have Z3 support on ubuntu 18 anymore like this.
Actually https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10483 might be the nicest way to get around that limitation - if we care at all that is.

We may also be able to just add ``libz3-static-dev`` to the static PPA build, but I'd need to invest some time into that to make sure that we won't run into issues due to static vs shared libstdc++ issues, etc.

CI won't let us go for this, though, until the ubuntu 18 CI runs are dropped from the required runs in the repo settings.

Also need to disable the CI expectation for `b_ubu18` in github if we merge this.

Removed the workaround from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10359/files here now.
I'm also seeing that we have old checks like making sure we have at least GCC 5.0 in cmake - we should probably bump that as well, but I'd do it separately and we need to decide by how much.

Let's see if bumping the minimal required version to the state of debian stable like that causes any issues in CI.

@chriseth We'd need to remove the ``b_ubu18`` run from the required CI runs for this, though.

Sure, use something else.

Not sure I understand that comment - you're the one who needs to remove the CI run requirement, aren't you :-)? Or do you want me to add another CI run that replaces that one, while being a "reasonably old" system or something like that? I could of course e.g. add a debian stable run, but that means we need new docker images and all that... so far I thought we'd just drop it without replacement.

Are we ready to merge? Should I disable the `b_ubu18` as a required CI run on github?

As far as I'm concerned, we can do that - but not sure what @chriseth's last comment was meant to say...
