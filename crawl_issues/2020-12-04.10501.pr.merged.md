# [\#10501 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10501) `merged`: Upgrade bytecode comparison container to node.js 14

Originally a part of #10429 but it's unrelated other than by the fact that both PRs update node.js versions of some containers. And it's small enough that it would easily go unnoticed there. I'm making a separate PR to get this properly reviewed.

Are there any reasons for keeping it on an ancient node.js version?

No reason other than that being the one other runs use :-). Merging.
