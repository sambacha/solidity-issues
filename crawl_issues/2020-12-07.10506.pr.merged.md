Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10485

Main question is whether this PR should actually be considered "fixing" https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10485, since the issue will still remain on develop for now.

Not sure if we actually couldn't merge this to develop as well.

Maybe we should try to fix this in develop, you are right.

Since we considered disallowing inheritance-related stuff (like using ``virtual``) in libraries bugfixes and thereby non-breaking in the past, I'd say it'd be fine to just rebase/retarget this to develop.

Changed target to develop.
