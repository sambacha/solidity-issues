Related to #10398.

This is an attempt to make external test job definitions in our CircleCI config a bit leaner. Any good suggestions on how to improve it are welcome.

~Note that I'm still trying things out so this PR might change a lot before it's ready for review.~ (done)

Did you try putting them all in a single shell script? This has the advantage that it can also be run locally.

We do have a script like that but it runs them sequentially. I think that it's better to parallelize the 3 runs they internally do with different optimizer settings. That will actually make them finish 3 times faster. But that'll be a separate PR.

Here I'm just playing with deduplicating the CircleCI config and I found a very nice solution (I just need to iron out some syntax problems). Looks like CircleCI has [parameterized jobs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#authoring-parameterized-jobs) so I can have just one definition and use it in the workflow with script name as a parameter. This makes the config **much** simpler without having to actually cram all of these tests into a single job.

This is ready now. Turned out better than I expected. Jobs in workflows are no longer one-liners but on the upside 10 job definitions were replaced by 2 parameterized ones and their number won't grow with the number of external tests.

Colony tests failed. Turns out that it actually does use the `lsof` dependency. I restored the step that installs it so the test should pass now.

I'm still not sold on putting the distinction between the tests into the circleci job config. This makes it easy to forget about another entry when you add a new test. If we put it inside the shell script, we instead have a single point of entry that might run sequential or in parallel, depending on whether we run it through circleci or not, and it is only adding another line to the shell script.
