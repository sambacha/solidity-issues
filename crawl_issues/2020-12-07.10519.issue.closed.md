Doing so would have caught https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10436, resp. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10494

We can either add some special run for this or we can just not skip the tests entirely if there is no solver, but just ignore the expectations.

(ping @leonardoalt for additional comments, if any)

We could actually run *all* our test files in general with the smtlib engine - it should be fast enough and would catch ICEs in the encoding part at least.

Running it on all tests will also be much easier when we replace the pragma with a command-line flag.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Should we reopen this? Seems simple enough, we already have the CLI flag and also it's an SMT issue (and we wanted to exclude these, though most of them are not labeled).

Stop trying to rescue issues :-).
