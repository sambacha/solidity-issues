# [\#10520 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10520) `merged`: Fix initial optimizer settings in external tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-07 19:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10520):

Currently external test scripts rely on the `$OPTIMIZER_LEVEL` variable to set minimal options that the external project works with. This variable is only used just before running tests though. If the project runs contract compilation during JS package installation (as it happens in case of Gnosis, see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10336#issuecomment-740106553), it's still using initial settings that do not set optimization level at all. This PR fixes fixes that by making the initial config use the lowest allowed optimization level.

The core of this PR is this change:
```patch
-module.exports['compilers'] = {solc: {version: "$dir/solc"} };
+module.exports['compilers'] = {solc: {version: "$dir/solc", settings: $(solc_settings "$OPTIMIZER_LEVEL" istanbul)}};
```
the rest is just a refactor to make that change easy without code duplication.
