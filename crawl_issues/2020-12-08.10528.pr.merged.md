# [\#10528 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10528) `merged`: Abiv2 isabelle: Add fuzzer test harness skeleton and update CMake

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-12-08 10:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10528):

This PR adds a dummy test harness for the upcoming abiv2 isabelle fuzzer and tests whether the docker changes related to libabicoder and gmp actually work (true if the ossfuzz build CI passes).

To actually test that libabicoder and libgmp properly work, you'd need to include abicoder.hpp and create a dummy instance of ``abicoder::ABICoder`` at least, wouldn't you?

Ah you are right, successful compilation does not imply successful runtime! Updated the PR. Please note that this PR still does not actually test run time behavior. For that we actually need to run the fuzzer (which is done in the nightly fuzzer job), so we may have to wait a day :-)

Seems to build at least.
