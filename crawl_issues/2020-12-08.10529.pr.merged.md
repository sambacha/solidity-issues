# [\#10529 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10529) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Remove assert that is not true for compound assignment with right shift

An assert has been introduced in #10380, that, however, does not hold for compound assignment with right shift where LHS is a `signed int` and RHS is `unsigned int` with the same number of bits. In that case, there is no common type which violates this `assert` even though it is not a problem for the compiler.

Fixes #10473.
Fixes #10522.
