As discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10477/files#r534375139, sometimes there is a need to give additional information about an error without the need for a secondary source location. In that case, there is only one location, but what we want to do is give a brief error message, and then additional details.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
