Closes #6905.
Depends on #10536.

I think with this we can finally close the issue for a good while.

I'm merging this based on @ekpyron's review (see thread starting at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10537#discussion_r540096283). We can always remove settings which turn out to be bad. Let's not spend more time on this and #6905 for the next months.
