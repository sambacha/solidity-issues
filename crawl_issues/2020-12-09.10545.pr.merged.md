Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10509.

Note that it wouldn't be a big deal to still accept ``modelCheckerSettings`` in 0.7, if ``settings.modelCheckerSettings`` isn't there (optionally with a warning, although *that* would take some doing, since ``StandardCompiler`` doesn't have a warning infrastructure), and only drop it for 0.8, in case we're worried about any tooling breaking/complaining.

Also we need to watch the bytecode comparison - should be fine, but I haven't checked locally.

For the record: all tests are green right now, but now I have to fix a Changelog conflict :-).
