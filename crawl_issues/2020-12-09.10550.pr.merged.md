I probably should have paid more attention to what @cameel is doing there to see how and where which branches are used/overridden :-).

Keeping as draft pending https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/5 and https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/safe-contracts/pull/2 .
Once they are merged, the last commit here can be dropped and this can be un-drafted.
