> IR implementation is missing.

I mentioned on gitter that I won't have time to do that today, so if it is a blocker (which I don't think it is), someone else has to pick it up.

You are just really bashing on my glorious implementation! :wink:

One good reason to keep it this way though, is that it seemed the opcode version is reviewed, and it is unlikely to change, however we can certainly expect a lot of changes in the IR part. This means having the two implementations allows us to be more likely to spot bugs -- that is until we make a complete switch to the new IR.

Haha, well - it is a fine implementation ;-). But I think we should in general do it like that - only implement new stuff in IR and call from old codegen. There's a reason why we *want* the IR after all - it's way easier to review and ensure to be correct. And I don't think there's much danger of it changing in any way, if we stick to the split into actual IR generation and util functions. In general I think bothering with the old stack-juggling is more likely to *introduce* bugs than to avoid them. Or if not full-blown bugs than slight discrepancies that are hard to spot. In general: at this point we should not really pay much for calling the IR code anymore, should we? So when has it ever been beneficial to willingly introduce code duplication ;-)?

So I'm not so much bashing the actual implementation here, but rather saying we should generally do it this way, i.e. implement IR only and call it from old codegen.
But if I'm missing anything there or in general, this implementation here is just fine ;-). Just takes ten times the amount of time to think through it and I'm not sure I see that much reason for going through that :-).

I'm actually on @axic's side here - having two implementation to compare sounds good.

By the way: the weird test failures are due to EOL'd docker images in the config - it's fixed at least on develop, not sure it's already merged to breaking.

I beg to differ. We did that initially, hence the `appendInlineAssembly` helper and perhaps 30% of the old codegen using it. That was the incremental approach. The new IR is just a complete, independent rewrite.  I guess the old real connection between the two is the YulUtilFunctions, but I would count that as somewhat different.

Anyway, I won't oppose replacing this, but I don't think it is necessarily needed, given my explanation in the previous comment.

Alright - that actually surprises me and I really don't understand that line of thinking there, but it's just fine for me if you agree on it :-).

I mean: I *am* talking about the ``YulUtilFunction`` that the IR implementation here *does* have :-). That's what I meant by if we keep the split between actual IR codegen and util functions. And it may not always fit, then the situation is different.
But yeah, no worries, since you both agree on this, I'll have another look at the old codegen implementation then and will approve then ;-)!

I don't think this is a helper function. Especially that we'll have a special case for the `code.length` shortcut.

Updated.
