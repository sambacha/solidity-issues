# [\#10556 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10556) `merged`: README describing the workflow around external tests and their repositories

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-09 19:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10556):

Somewhat related to #10429 and all the chaos around updating branches in `solidity-external-tests`.

I decided to write down the recommended workflow since it's not all that obvious what can/should/must be done when updating these tests. Different people do it slightly differently and this way sometimes get in the way of each other. The current text describes how I think it should be done but it's also an opportunity to discuss it. I'll apply any changes that result from the discussion.

I'm not sure if a README in an obscure directory is the best place for it but I think it's not relevant enough to end-users to put it in the main docs. Someone tasked with updating these tests will probably manage to find it.

(As you may have seen in the chainid PR) I usually create a branch and a draft PR in the external test repo, have a temporary commit in the solidity repo changing the tests to that branch, verify that it's ok, and then drop that commit from the solidity PR, marking all of them simultanously ready to merge.
I think that's reasonable. Note that depending on what we change, merging directly to the external test repos can easily break all other PRs until the corresponding solidity PR is merged, so better to try to do all of it at once in general.
If it's clear that the change is backwards-compatible, i.e. it won't break other test runs, and it's trivially correct, it's fine to skip all of that, though :-). Also not sure we need to document any of this.

I added a section describint that. It's basically what @ekpyron said above. I think that's a good workflow.

Ready for another round. I have added a new section about PRs on `breaking`, rewrote the text not to require having a separate branch for `breaking` unless necessary (which means that we could have a 'hole' in versioning) and also mentioned that basing our branches on an upstream branch that uses newer compiler is preferable when such a branch is available.
