… that integer type

In preparation for abiv2 isabelle encoder that only accepts integers in the range for that integer type.

If I read the code correctly, we still won't end up with the full range of values for each type - but with a good portion of it, so it's not a big deal.

I agree. I think the main source of non uniform randomness is the use of a monotonically increasing counter. Instead, I should move towards a uniform prng such as std::uniform_distribution at some point.

Merging it for now. Looking forward to the template based code improvement you have in mind @ekpyron !
