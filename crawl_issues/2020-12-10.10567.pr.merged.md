# [\#10567 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10567) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix CHC analysis of increment/decrement

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-12-10 16:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10567):

Fixes #10565.
Fixes #10514.

Adds unary increment and decrement as a verification target for CHC and at the same time fixes the missing wrapping logic for these operations.
