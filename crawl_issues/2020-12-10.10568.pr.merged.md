Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10532.

The first PR fixes the ICE with clang 6 - but then again we actually dropped support, so the second commit actually checks that in cmake. But not sure, if that works as is for osx - CI will tell.

Ping @leonardoalt about the CHC change.

Ok, that would probably be why we haven't verified the clang version so far... weird... seemed like it *should* be defined... I'll check...
