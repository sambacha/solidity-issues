# [\#10570 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10570) `merged`: Ensure empty arrays are not visited and fix formatting issues

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-12-10 17:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10570):

The following bugs are fixed by this PR

1. When visiting emtpy (zero length) arrays of struct type, encoded value is not altered beyond `[]`
2. When formatting value across struct types of another composite type (e.g., struct type) ensure that a comma is placed between the two types
3. When formatting value for a composite type involving an empty array `[]`, treat the empty array as a single element so that a comma is placed on subsequent elements

The latest update is that the fuzzer ran out of memory after about 20 minutes. I wonder if there is a memory leak somewhere. Wonder if I need to manually deallocate the heap memory allocated to the abicoder.

Edit: The problem seems to be someplace else. Will need to take a closer look.

@ekpyron is that approval?
