Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5264

This PR adds support to `abi.*` functions as Uninterpreted Functions. This means that the actual returned value is **not** computed, and the things we know are true are that the application of the same function over the same arguments returns the same thing.
Because `abi.*` take an arbitrary number of arguments, we can't have fixed sorts for those functions like we do with the crypto functions. In this case, we need to traverse the code and collect all different calls to `abi.*` and make an SMT sort for each of those.

This is ready for review again.
@ekpyron had some minor comments which were taken care of.
