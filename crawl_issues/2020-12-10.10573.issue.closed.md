Some fuzzers are built on every CI run, while others only on `b_ossfuzz`. Because of this the libfuzzer headers are not available and we have to resort to manual prototypes. Would be nice to only build all the fuzzers on `b_ossfuzz` and clean them up from warnings (such as `-Wno-sign-conversion`, etc).

We could by the way also enable all the warnings for the fuzzing builds, if we used cmake's mechanism to declare declare the offending generated headers as ``SYSTEM`` headers, for which warnings will be ignored.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
