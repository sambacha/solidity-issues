# [\#10583 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10583) `merged`: Fix checks for code snippets embedded in docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-12 05:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10583):

While fixing shellcheck warnings in scripts I discovered a combination of several bugs in the script for validating code snippets in docs. This was making these checks ineffective in many cases and there were a few snippets that slipped through with wrong version pragmas due to this.
