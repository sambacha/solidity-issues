# [\#10585 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10585) `merged`: Fix quoting in shell scripts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-12 06:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10585):

This PR is a part of my set of fixes that solve all the shellcheck warnings in our scripts. Missing quotes are the single most common cause of warnings and they're (usually) trivial to fix. I put them in a separate PR to get done with them first and not have that noise mixed in with my the other changes. Any changes that require something more complex than just putting quotes on the variable will be submitted in a separate PR.

These changes are more tricky than they might seem though because quoting stuff that is not supposed to be quoted can lead to subtle errors. I have dealt with a lot (hopefully all) of these already but I think this still needs some manual testing - many of these scripts never run in the CI.

~For that reason it's still a draft but feel free to review already, the PR will probably change very little.~

The PR is now ready for review. I tested what I could locally and the remaining stuff looks very unlikely to fail silently so hopefully CI can weed it out.
