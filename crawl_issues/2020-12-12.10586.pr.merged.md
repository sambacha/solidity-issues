# [\#10586 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10586) `merged`: Fixes for shellcheck warnings, part 1

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-12 06:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10586):

~Depends on #10877.~ It's on `develop` now.

This PR fixes most of shellcheck warnings in our scripts. Those are only the ones that were not actual errors (those are covered by #10584, #10583) or just missing quotes (#10585, #10877).

~These are not all fixes, just the ones that I could easily put in an independent branch. I have a few more but they depend on all the other branches so I'd like to get these here merged first. When we're done with them I'll submit the rest and another PR that removes all the scripts (now warning-free) from shellcheck ignore list.~ ~EDIT: I decided to just put it on top of the other PRs and just get them all through review one by one. So this will remain a draft until all the PRs below are merged.~ EDIT: Ready for review.

@cameel why is it a draft?

Basically, I'm not yet 100% confident that this does not break anything and I want to test it manually a bit more but I'm stuck in the bytecode compare PRs at the moment and I want to finish them first.

I think you could definitely merge without hesitation the `/usr/bin/env` and `set -e` changes separately.

@axic Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I'm going to split this PR into smaller ones and get it merged in smaller pieces to make it more manageable. The changes you mentioned will go in first.

I tested all I could locally and I think this should all work fine. I'm marking it as ready for review.

Looks good, can you squash? I'll approve then

Why squash though? It's not a pile of random fixup commits :) Each commit deals with a different warning and the description says what is being fixed. It's just that there were quite a few different things to fix. It would be a jumbled mess if I squashed that so I'd rather not.

Hmmm ok, it's quite a lot of commits though. I'll approve it anyway, if anyone doesn't like it blame @cameel !

Yeah, I know. But do we have a rule against that? No one is being paid by the commit anyway :) I thought that it's more about whether it appropriate for the situation.

I do see that there's a tendency towards bigger commits in Solidity so I mostly try to do that too and only have a few per PR even though personally I prefer smaller ones. Especially in PRs like this one where the fix consists of many independent parts that are better off viewed separately, I think smaller ones make more sense. There are bigger and smaller changes here and I think that without separating them the smaller ones can easily get lost in the noise.

That's fine with me
