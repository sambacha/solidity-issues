Added the test. But I think I should remove the changelog entry, because this was not crashing in 0.7.5, it was merely unsupported. Right?

Wasn't it crashing in the issue?

It was, but the issue was not for v0.7.5, but for develop (at that time). Since the changelog captures the changes between releases of the compiler, this probably should not be in the changelog, since the problem has been introduced after the last release, and hopefully will be fixed before this next release.
