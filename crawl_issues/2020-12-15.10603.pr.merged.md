Does this mean that adding a new step needs a change in these files, too?

Sadly yes. Because each step is now an enum in the specification here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10603/files#diff-da0123b365359cddade59392765a6630784ee02b7c90cad08955467b60f1a652R413

Does it at least fail if we forget to add it?

No, for example reasoning based simplifier is not added yet (due to z3 dependency that is unmet) but the fuzzer silently ignores the omission.

We could think of making each optimiser step a class that can be selected through an unsigned integer. In that case, we could make the fuzzer spec also an unsigned integer and use it to select a specific optimiser step.

That sounds good! Actually I realized that the steps are not really the classes, but rather those that are defined in Suite.cpp. Some tests group multiple steps into one "test unit". Maybe we can change Suite.cpp to have a list of all "test names" that are run?

Actually, an optimiser step or "test unit" for the sake of fuzzing is exactly the same as the one in yul unittest framework. An intermediate solution would be to retain support for unit tests via a string name of the optimiser step and have another numeric representation of "test unit" that the fuzzer uses. Both the numeric representation and the string name must map to the same series of steps. Wdyt @chriseth ?

I'm not sure I understand - what I think would be useful is if Suite.cpp would define a list of steps by name (and then maybe a mapping to lambda functions for executing them). Then the fuzzer can use arbitrary integers to access them.

I tried to do it here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10811 and requested your review. I will rebase this PR accordingly.
