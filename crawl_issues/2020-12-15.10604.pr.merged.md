The following explicit conversions are disallowed:

1. uint160 -> address payable
2. bytes20 -> address payable
3. literals -> address payable (payable(0) is an exception)


TODO:

- [x] Write tests

I did not add a changelog since there is already a line

>  * Type System: Explicit conversions between two types are disallowed if it changes more than one of sign, width or kind at the same time.
