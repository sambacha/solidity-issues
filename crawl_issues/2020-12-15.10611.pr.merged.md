The change looks good, but I was not able to reproduce the bug.

I had to comment out the `catch` clauses in `CommandLineInterface` to make the exception throw on the command line.

Can you explain why this problem can happen? Especially for a non-builtin function, ilteralArguments should always be nullptr.

Ah, sorry. The tests added don't correspond to the fix. As you said, I incorrectly assumed literal arguments are non null for user defined functions. Please see the new PR with the missing test case that fixes the out of bounds read.
