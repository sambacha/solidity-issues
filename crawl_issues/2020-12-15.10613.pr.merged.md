# [\#10613 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10613) `merged`: Asmanalysis: Add test case that demonstrates bug

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-12-15 16:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10613):

This PR adds test case that was missing in the already merged #10611 

The bug happens because
  - literalArguments for `datasize(x,1)` is non null
  - size of literalArguments is `1`
  - size of function call arguments is `2`
  - so, in the second iteration, `literalArguments->at(1)` leads to an out of bounds read that #10611 already fixed

This PR simply adds the missing test case
