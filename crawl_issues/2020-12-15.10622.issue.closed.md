Extracted from here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10326#discussion_r543459207

Currently `AsmParser` fails because these characters are considered illegal. Also it fails with rather bad message:
```
ParserError 1856: (35-47): Literal or identifier expected.
```
and it looks misleading. So, we need to decide, are we allowing these in comments and if not, should we consider changing error message.
