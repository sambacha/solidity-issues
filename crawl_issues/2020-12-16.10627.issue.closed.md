Consider improving error reporting of scanner errors (including SemVerParser). Right now both Solidity and Yul parsers may just report "invalid token".

Hi @axic and @cameel  - I saw this is a good first candidate issue and started doing some work specifically with the SemVer error reporting. You can see a draft PR here:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12487

I just wanted to check before continuing work on this whether you are happy with the implementation and some questions:
- I'm not sure what error codes we should throw or where I can find typical error codes - this is currently failing in the CI since for development purposes I've just made the error code 1465.
- I added the BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION in the catch since some invalid parsed expressions did not throw - is this okay or would this break some of the language compilation?

After your guidance I would be up for moving onto the other scanner errors to try improve the reporting.

Please let me know and thank you :)

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
