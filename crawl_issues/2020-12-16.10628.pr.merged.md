# [\#10628 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10628) `merged`: Fix line endings in Unicode diretion override tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-16 13:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10628):

One of the tests added in #10326 has Windows line endings. We probably have some line-ending conversion that kicks in only on non-CRLF platforms because the source locations in error messages end up being different on Windows because of this.

### Details

Well, should that be the case really?

Depends. That's pretty typical behavior in Python for example. I'm not sure if boost in C++ adds some conversion when you read a file in text mode. Might be worth investigating. Also, do we have any tests for different line endings?

The problem might also be related to git instead of C++ - the checkout routine on windows introduces different line breaks for text files.

But does it do it automatically? @axic says we don't have anything like this set up on purpose at least:

I don't think so. Well we do have scanner tests to make sure they are parsed correctly, but no tests for the error reporter.
