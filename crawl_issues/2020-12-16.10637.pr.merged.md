```
No release ^0.8.0 was listed in available releases!
```
Oh, so that's the reason for these `.99` pragmas.

The release fixed the docs check failing due to missing 0.8.0 but two jobs still fail, apparently due to one more not upgraded pragma in `control_structures.rst`?

```
Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.8.0-develop.2020.12.16+commit.a7d957f3.Darwin.appleclang) - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
```

Was `develop` changed to 0.8.1 yet?
