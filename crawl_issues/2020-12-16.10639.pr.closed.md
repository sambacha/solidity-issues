# [\#10639 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10639) `closed`: stdlib prototype
**Labels**: `selected for development`, `roadmap`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-12-16 19:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10639):

Part of #10282.

TODO:
 - [ ] provide a way to export the standard library as a directory hierarchy from the commandline interface (or standard-json - then it would be a json map of filename -> string)
 - [ ] only include standard library files in the compiler stack input files if they were imported (use the import file resolution mechanism for that)
 - [ ] if a file is included whose name clashes with a file in the standard library (or maybe even the prefix `std/`), check if its contents match the built-in contents and don't do anything. Otherwise warn.
 - [ ]  Changelog entry

If the three points are combined, you can export the standard library to a folder and importing from that folder would do the same as importing the built-in standard library.

The contents of the standard library are of course version-dependent.

I wonder if we should just start committing stdlib under `semanticTests/externalSources` and iterating on it? And once it is in a useful state, git move those files to `/stdlib` and get it exposed in the compiler.

@axic wen stdlib

Pushed here a new approach, where a compiler flag enables the stdlib. This way perhaps we can merge these 3 precompiles as a start.

We should use a pragma to activate the standard library behaviour on a per-file basis.
For this, we need a list of symbols that should be excluded from the global symbols in the lookup when the pragma is active. This can be implemented in the Name Resolver - whenever we look up a symbol from a file with the pragma and reach the 'nullptr' scope, we only return names that are not in the exclusion list.

That is how I started initially (see the commit history), but the the symbol resolution was messy as well as symbol visibility in imports.  The benefit of having the pragma is being able to mix existing libraries/code.

We can add the `roadmap` label to this PR, so it doesn't get the bot's attention, right @r0qs?

~Yes, or even use `must have` or `must have eventually` with prevent the bot to mark it as stale.~
Just a small correction since `must have` is only used for issues and not PRs. So just use `roadmap` as you said.

Decision from the call: we'd prefer a special syntax for the stdlib imports:

import std.cryprography;

Changes to `Parser::parseImportDirective()` and the grammar then. Would be nice to crosspost this to the [stdlib issue](#10282). Might be a bit annoying (haven't looked into it yet) to protect against allowing this syntax without the pragma being enabled.

I did cross-post there already. Small changes in the parser will of course be needed (the stdlib import will use an identifier path) but this will all be behind an experimental pragma so non-breaking.

And I don't think we'll be keeping the ANTLR grammar up to date with the experimental changes. @ekpyron already thinks that even trying to keep it up to date as is is too much of a distraction.

Ah, so we're changin the pragma directive as well. Should this be implemented separately as a prerequisite for stdlib, and then this PR updated respectively?

I think separately, because we want it done and merged in the very near future. It should not be held back by discussions of other changes in this PR.

Yeah, we won't maintain an antlr grammar for the experimental version of the language - we can do that once we  have stabilized it :-).

And yes, this PR will be rebased on top of a generic "pragma experimental solidity-next;" PR, which we'll have soon (after that we can drop the ``pragma stdlib`` here) - and that experimental pragma will work in such a way that it can enable an experimental parser mode that can then be permissive in the import directive and allow this new style.

> @ekpyron said on the call that anyone not busy with other tasks could start working on that already. We'll discuss further steps next week.

"That" being the ``pragma experimental solidity-next;`` PR first - and once that's done rebasing this PR on top of that, if there's even more time to spare.
