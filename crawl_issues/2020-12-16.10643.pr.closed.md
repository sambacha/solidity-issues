# [\#10643 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10643) `closed`: Replace ABIEncoderV1Only with checking for pragma

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-12-16 23:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10643):

Depends on #10795

In short: any file **requiring** the abicoder V1 implicitly requires the old codegen, given the IR switches on abicoder V2 unconditionally. This PR therefore replaces the `ABIEncoderV1Only` setting with the v1 pragma and `compileViaYul: false`.

Also removed some stray experimental or unneeded abicoder v2 pragmas. (There are still 351 of them remaining.)D

@axic I forgot to ask about this one on the call. What's the status here? Do we want to go forward with this change? Is this PR blocked by anything?

I think we should still review this whole issue, but closing since the core annoyance should be fixed via #11396.
