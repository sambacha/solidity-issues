## Description

Trying to install solc compiler on ubuntu 18.04.5. Faced with issue
`The following packages have unmet dependencies:`
` solc : Depends: libc6 (>= 2.29) but 2.27-3ubuntu1.3 is to be installed`

It could be solved by upgrading libc6 to required version. On ubuntu 18.04.5 - 2.27 it is a standard version
https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libc6

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.0
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04.5

## Steps to Reproduce

Ubuntu 18.04.5 Machine
`sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum`
`sudo apt-get update`
`sudo apt-get install solc`

@ekpyron is it possible to downgrade libc6 in the ppa cross-build?

Apparently, there's something wrong with the static ppa builds in general. They should not depend on libc of any version at all...

The problem is that we don't only package ``solc``, but also ``solidity-upgrade`` and ``yul-phaser`` in the package and while ``solc`` as we build it works with any libc version, the other two won't - so we'll either need to remove them from that installation or build them statically as well, otherwise ubuntu's ppa dependency autotracking will prevent installation.

I don't think we need to ship `yul-phaser`, but building `solidity-upgrade` statically would be nice.

And I would say it is fine if we fix these for 0.8.1 (and perhaps make a 0.7.7 release for it).

We should definitely have a 0.8.0 ~~and 0.7.6~~ release package that works, shouldn't we? And it's just build settings, it's no problem just rebuilding them properly.

If it doesn't need a change in the repo, that's even better. But is only the ubuntu thing affected or stuff in solc-bin too?

It's only the ubuntu PPA releases for <20.04. I just uploaded a new build for 0.8.0 in the static repo on launchpad already, though - if that works out and is properly static, we just need to copy that over to the old distros.

@payvint we just published a new PPA build. Can you confirm that the problem no longer occurs?

At least I now can successfully install 0.8.0 from the PPA repo in a ubuntu 18.04 docker image, so I think we can close this.

Yeap - that works - thanks!
