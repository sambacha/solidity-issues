# [\#10647 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10647) `merged`: Build solidity-upgrade and yul-phaser statically on static PPA builds.

For the record: this is what I'm doing to fix https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10644
The issue being that ``solidity-upgrade`` and ``yul-phaser`` are not built statically, but only ``solc`` - but we package all of them, s.t. the entire package will depend on old glibc.
It'd be nicer to do this per-cmake-target depending on ``SOLC_LINK_STATIC`` instead, but this also works and maybe we should merge this, s.t. this doesn't happen on the next release again - even though we might want to do it more nicely later.

This is the build triggered like that that's currently running: https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static/+build/20699680

Just looking at the package that was just built on launchpad - looks like it worked, all executables are static in there. I'll check if it indeed doesn't think it depends on libc anymore and then once the launchpad publish process is complete will do the package copy to ubuntu 18.04 and older.

Yes, dependencies are gone from the control metadata in the new package.

Now I asked launchpad for the copies - I think it should only be a matter of time before the issue resolves itself (launchpad is just slow to do these things).
