# [\#10650 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10650) `merged`: Mark msg.sender and tx.origin as nonpayable in docs

I just noticed that the documentation was never updated to indicate that `msg.sender` and `tx.origin` are now `address` rather than `address payable`.  Obviously that's a simple matter to fix so I figured I'd just submit a PR for it. :)  Thanks!
