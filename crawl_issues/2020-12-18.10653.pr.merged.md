They actually are. This is what the test is about.

Come on @stackenbotten.

Is there a way to put some file on an exception list?

@axic There actually is [a spot in `check_style.sh` that we're using as an ad-hoc whitelist](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.0/scripts/check_style.sh#L9-L12):

``` bash
WHITESPACE=$(git grep -n -I -E "^.*[[:space:]]+$" |
  grep -v "test/libsolidity/ASTJSON\|test/libsolidity/ASTRecoveryTests\|test/compilationTests/zeppelin/LICENSE" |
  grep -v -E "test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/comments/unicode_direction_override_1.sol"
)
```

But I added a suggestion above that I think is better than disabling this check for the whole file.

@cameel thanks, took both suggestions!

Looks like some tests are failing because not adding the license line changed the source locations where errors happen. Fortunately only 5 are failing (I'd expect many more). They probably contain the license comment already and I think it's best to just remove it.

The longer it will take to merge this, the more times we'll need to adjust tests :wink:

@axic @cameel if you have time we could try to fix and merge this at once

OK. I'll take it over and add the extra tests I suggested.

This is now finished and ready for another review.

All my changes to @axic's commits (except for those required to rebase properly) are left in unsquashed fixups for now and here's the summary of the bigger ones:
- `SyntaxTest::filterObtainedErrors()` was not updated to subtract the new preamble from source locations in error messages. This is the bug I was talking about earlier. But it was not on `develop` after all.
- Added the extra tests cases I recommended. Both as `*.sol` files and as metadata tests.
- Refactored duplicate code out of metadata license tests.

Please take a look at the results of metadata tests. In some cases they are different than I expected. I'll point them out in code comments.

Looks like `t_bytecode_compare` is failing because of #10771: the Windows build uses author date while others use committer date and in this particular PR these dates are different. I created #10791 to fix that.

Needs squashing.

I think it will pass because the only failing test was the bytecode comparison that was broken on `develop` for a moment.

Before merging I'll still need to squash the fixups.

Fixups squashed. Let's make sure all tests pass before merging - I didn't have time to rerun local tests after replacing the assert yet.
