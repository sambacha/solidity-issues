# [\#10661 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10661) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Checked arithmetic and unchecked blocks

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10066

Some effects of this PR:
- Previously it was possible to report multiple sequential failing underflow/overflow targets, because the expression's resulting value was wrapped. Now this is not always possible anymore for the checked case, because the actual computed value adds new constraints to the rest of the program, since an underflow/overflow there would always revert.
- Many false positives reporting underflow/overflow inside loops are now gone. Those were likely due to the nonlinear arithmetic in the wrapping logic inside loops, which made it extra hard. Without the nonlinear parts those targets are now ok.

Still missing
- [x] Unchecked block tests

Will need rebase and also some tests are failing...

I'll do the review anyway
