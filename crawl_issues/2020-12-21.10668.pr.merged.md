Even more? Not sure I want that :p

@bshastry on a related note, we actually decided to remove the pragma and only use the compiler option `model-checker-engine` (with default `none`). So maybe it's worth to do that directly instead?

I'm not sure I follow. Could you please briefly explain?

One option would be to have a CI job that runs the solc fuzzer on every PR so that low hanging bugs are caught pre merge?

Yea that could be. Not sure @chriseth would like that though.

Currently the SMTChecker runs if the pragma is present in the source, and the cli/json option `model-checker-engine` lets you choose which SMTChecker engine you want to run: all (current default), bmc, chc, none. These options are only valid if the pragma is present. Choosing engine=none has the same effect as no pragma. So we will deprecate `pragma experimental SMTChecker;` and use `model-checker-engine=none` as the default.

Ah I see. IIuc, your suggestion is to do something like 

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/67712d50ba2de411fe781e7f6385ad1ceee155d5/test/libsolidity/SMTCheckerTest.cpp#L70

with the setting `all`? Seems more elegant that string manipulation for sure!


Edit

I would need to
  - [ ] Add experimental pragma in source
  - [x] Enable `all` in model checker settings

Not one or another but both

@leonardoalt when you say you plan to deprecate smt checker pragma instruction i.e., `pragma experimental SMTChecker`, how would the user get the smt checker to run on their contract? would this be purely based on the cli option i.e., model checker setting (= bmc/chc/all)?

Yes, that's the idea (cli or standard json).

Exactly.

Only this one.

But since it's not a lot of code, we can also go on with this PR, and then remove it later.

Would the smt checker run if I remove the pragma and only set model checker settings to all? I'm guessing the experimental pragma has not already been deprecated?

Yea that's the thing. If we merge this PR as is it would already work, and we haven't removed the pragma yet.

Done. I added the `modelcheckersetting = all`  setting as well, could you please take a quick look?

Merging since CI failures are unrelated to this PR.
