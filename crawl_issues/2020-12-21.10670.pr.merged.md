# [\#10670 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10670) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix virtual modifier called statically

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-12-21 10:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10670):

Fixes #10660.

This is a fix for a recent PR #10597.
Virtual modifiers require virtual resolution when they are called directly, using only the name: `m`.
However, when the name is qualified, using concrete contract type, the call is actually static: `A.m`.

Ah, I think we should also add a Changelog entry since the bug made the release.

Actually, no, the PR that introduced this bug was merged after the release.
