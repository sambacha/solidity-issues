Add empty vyper executable /usr/bin/vyper, if `vyper` command can not be found.

Why not juts ask zeppelin/truffle people how to disable this? Vyper support to truffle has been recently added, so perhaps it is not perfect yet.

@axic Yes, that would be the cleanest solution. But I don't know how fast they fix it. At least for now this would be a fix.

I guess the zeppelin repo just takes latest truffle (cc @frangio @nventuro), and truffle only added vyper support last week. So we could lock the truffle version into a known working one, or report the problem (cc @gnidan) and wait for the next truffle release?

I don't think this is an issue with the OpenZeppelin repo, since it uses Buidler rather than Truffle.

Here is an example run: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/11998/workflows/716bc7a8-c93d-4edf-95b3-286343917f25/jobs/567972

It still uses our fork (last rebased 2nd December) for 0.8.x compatibility: https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/openzeppelin-contracts/commits/master_080

You are right, it uses buidler. Our test scripts are not updated, however in the end it calls `npm run test`, so that should be correct. Not sure what is going on to be honest ðŸ˜…

The error seems to be happening before it gets to `npm run test`, so it must be the custom Truffle setup that's causing this.

I also don't think this test is doing what it's meant to do, because the result of compiling with the custom Truffle setup will not be used for the tests. Since Buidler reads its artifacts from a different directory it will be recompiled with our Buidler-configured solc version.

I'm taking a look at this and seeing if I can fix the external test. I don't yet know how to configure Buidler with a custom solc version but I'm looking into it.

I played with this a bit and found the reason for the `vyper` call. The call occurs specifically at the end `npx truffle compile` and this piece of Vyper detection in Truffle seems to be responsible:

https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/v5.1.58/packages/compile-vyper/index.js#L15
```javascript
const VYPER_PATTERN = "**/*.{vy,v.py,vyper.py,json}"; //include JSON for interfaces
```

Basically, even if the project has no Vyper source but Truffle finds any `.json` files nested one level deep in subdirectories, it assumes that the project contains Vyper code and that it should run the compiler. And there are quite a few of those:
- One per contract in `artifacts/` - apparently this is the compilation result created by Buidler (which runs automatically during `npm install`).
- `cache/last-solc-config.json`, `cache/solc-input.json`, `cache/solc-output.json`
- `contracts/package.json`

Removing all of these files made Truffle stop trying to call `vyper` for me. That's not really a solution though. The problem is this detection rule which seems to be making very strong assumptions. Most of these files are intermediate/temporary but `contracts/package.json` is actually in the repo so Truffle basically no longer works with OpenZeppelin while that file is there.

Like @frangio said, tests are actually running on the code compiled by Buidler not Truffle. I previously thought they were using truffle-compiled code but I just did not notice that the Buidler compilation happens during dependency installation. So creating the `vyper` executable silences Truffle (and might be an OK very short-term band aid) but we should really just switch this test to Buidler.

I may not have time to fix this for a few days, so here's what I have in mind in case anyone else wants to tackle it first.

I think the solution will be to create a new `buidler.config.js` file that `require`s the existing one (which should have been renamed first), then overwrites the returned solc config so that it uses the custom solc module. There is [a plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/buidler-ovm-compiler.html) that allows configuring the compiler with a path to the module.

Could someone please open a Truffle issue for that JSON detection? We can get that fixed easily I'm sure! Thanks for bringing it to my attention!

Looks like Truffle 5.1.61 (which includes https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/pull/3650) fixed this for us and OpenZeppelin tests are passing again so we can close this PR.

Actually, I wanted to update it manually and then realized that it already works for some reason - even though OpenZeppelin does not really depend on newest Truffle. In fact it does not depend on Truffle at all so our script that calls it should not work. Turns out that `npx` just "conveniently" downloads the package when the executable is not present, which is a weird design choice to say the least. I guess that's also the reason we did not realize that OZ is not really using Truffle. I really prefer when things fail when they're broken... We should switch to using `npx --no-install` from now on unless we do mean to install things.

Anyway, the external tests no longer fail but the underlying issue is not fixed. I'm going to submit a PR that updates the tests to use Buidler with OZ which will be the real fix. In the meantime I rebased the `master_080` branch in https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/openzeppelin-contracts on the current upstream `master`.

@frangio 
> There is [a plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/buidler-ovm-compiler.html) that allows configuring the compiler with a path to the module.

I tried using the plugin but after following the instructions from that page I'm getting errors like `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` when I run Buidler. Not sure if I'm using it wrong or if something changed in Buidler since if was written.

Also, using it requires installing the whole `@eth-optimism/ovm-toolchain` after which I end up with multiple copies of `solc-js`. 

``` bash
npm list solc
```
```
openzeppelin-solidity@3.3.0 /tmp/a/openzeppelin-contracts

This seems like an overkill. I wonder if there is a simpler way to do it. I read Buidler sources and I see that it can use a compiler from an arbitrary path internally just fine (it does so with the compiler binaries it downloads and caches in `~/.cache/buidler-nodejs/compilers/` - it's not hard-coded) but [`buidler compile`](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/src/builtin-tasks/compile.ts#L472-L574) does not expose that in anyway. It insists on downloading it, only accepts versions from `list.json` in `solc-bin` and verifies checksums so you cannot just insert a different binary into its cache.

Yes it's definitely overkill. One of the things to keep in mind is our repo is currently using Buidler and not Hardhat (i.e. the new version of Buidler). We will migrate to Hardhat in a few weeks probably and we can make a pull request to this repo once that happens. In Hardhat it seems easier to override what solcjs is used by overriding the `TASK_COMPILE_SOLIDITY_RUN_SOLCJS` task.

In the meantime in Buidler it seems the easiest is to use a locally installed `solc` module, which will be picked up here: https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/fe4e889f7f9d90a9f952f167cfe1a9c22e25bb19/packages/buidler-core/src/internal/solidity/compiler/index.ts#L47-L50

Oh, thanks for pointing that out! I actually went through that code but I was looking for stuff that reads options from Buidler config file and missed the fact that the local version is actually picked up from `version` property in `solc/package.json`. That looks like it would work for us.

BTW, Yesterday on the call @axic said that he had some work half-done on updating this external test so I'm going to wait until he pushes his code to avoid duplicating the work.

Since this hotfix PR is no longer needed, I'm going to close it. I have created an issue about properly fixing the external test and we should move our discussion there: #10745.
