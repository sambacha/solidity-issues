# [\#10676 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10676) `merged`: Bytecode comparison via CLI interface

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-12-22 09:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10676):

Fixes #4698.

~**Depends on #10819. Don't merge until that PR is merged!**.~ It's on `develop` now.

This PR adds `--interface` option to `prepare_report.py` to allow selecting between doing the compilation via Standard JSON or via the ordinary CLI interface.

It also modifies the existing CI jobs to create both versions of the report to make sure they're identical.

Yeah, I know. I'm working on a fix: #10822.

Anyway, I'm switching this PR to draft mode. It can be reviewed but I'm still working on resolving minor issues so it's not mergable yet.

Bytecode comparison problems have been resolved so this is now ready.

Rebased. I thought I rebased it just after the Z3 4.8.10 merge but it must have been a little too early :)
