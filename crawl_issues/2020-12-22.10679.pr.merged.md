# [\#10679 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10679) `merged`: Backwards compatibility for bytecode comparison

~Depends on #10676. Don't merge until that PR is merged!~ It's on `develop` now.

This is a set of workarounds for #10183, to make `prepare_report.py` and `prepare_report.js` work with older versions of the compiler:
- The option to disable SMT Checker only appeared in 0.7.6. Before that we need to fall back to stripping pragmas.
- Some versions have more whitespace in CLI output.
- On 0.6.0 and 0.6.1 Yul optimizer was enabled by default which results in different metadata.
- Before 0.4.6 the `--metadata` option was not supported. Up to 0.4.4 it was ignored but on 0.4.5 and 0.4.6 it cause an error so I added a step to detect that and prevent the script from using it.
- On 0.4.11 the emscripten builds of the compiler raise exceptions instead of reporting an error on some invalid input (specifically: extracted examples that are actually LLL, not Solidity). Now there's a try/catch block that handles this like all other errors.

#10676 has just been merged so I'm marking this a ready for review.
