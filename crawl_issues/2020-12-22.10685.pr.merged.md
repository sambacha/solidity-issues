@blishko since you worked on a similar thing for modifiers recently, can you review this? I think the only difference to the modifiers implementation is that this can also be `super`

Sure, will check it.

Thanks! I'm a bit annoyed about adding `m_currentContract` to all these helpers. Not super convinced, but also don't know another way.

Some of the helper functions are static, so we can't use `m_currentContract`. I'll check whether `m_currentContract` is consistent in all the non static ones.

Re `super` I added a test which caused a bug, so checking that now

This passing of `m_currentContract` everywhere is annoying. Does it make sense to change some helpers to be non-static and just use `m_currentContract` instead of having additional parameter?

It is annoying, but I would prefer to keep those helpers static, especially for the upcoming free functions stuff.

@mijovic approve or should I change anything?
