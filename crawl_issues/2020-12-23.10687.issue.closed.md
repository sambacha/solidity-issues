# [\#10687 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10687) `closed`: Convert certain `and(mul(a, b), mask)` and `and(add(a, b), mask)` into `mulmod(a, b, x)` and `addmod(a, b, y)`
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

For example the following solidity snippet

```solidity
uint160 a, b;
unchecked { a + b }
```

would be converted into (by the optimizer)

```
let _1 := sub(shl(160, 1), 1)
let value := and(mul(a, b), _2)
```

Here `_1` is a shorter representation of the constant.

Instead the more optimized version would be
```
let _1 := shl(160, 1)
let value := mulmod(a, b, _1)
```

It is shorter and avoids a `sub`. `and + mul` has the same gas as `mulmod`.

Similarly, for `addmod`, but `add + and` is `6`, and `addmod` is `8`. We save a `sub`. So total saving of `2` gas and shorter deploy code.

---------

It maybe easier to implement this as a rule `and(mul(X, Y), A) -> mulmod(X, Y, 2**N)` where `A = 2**N - 1`. Similarly, for the other?

This sounds good in general, but I'm a bit concerned about this transform destroying some other potential opportunities.

@pv2k I'm still not sure if this is a good idea. If you want a similar issue, maybe https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5810 could be good to work on.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
