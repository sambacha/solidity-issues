The more `mload`, that we can resolve, it becomes important to remove mstores that are never acessesed. 

In the proxy example (optimized code of proxy.yul from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10681/files#diff-a543663ab8a611118fb129bbe24b2def1b3c4c8f79948d42cd61b0d8122d3015)

The two `mstore(64, ...)` is redundant.

```yul
{
    {
        let _1 := 128
        // write to 64, but this is redundant
        mstore(64, _1)
        if callvalue() { revert(0, 0) }
        let _2 := 0
        // does not write to location 64
        calldatacopy(_1, _2, calldatasize())
        // does not write to location 64
        mstore(add(_1, calldatasize()), _2)
        // does not write to location 64
        pop(delegatecall(gas(), 25, _1, calldatasize(), _2, _2))
        let data := _2
        switch returndatasize()
        case 0 { data := 96 }
        default {
            let newFreePtr := add(_1, and(add(returndatasize(), 63), not(31)))
            if or(gt(newFreePtr, 0xffffffffffffffff), lt(newFreePtr, _1))
            {
                // this block does not read or write from 64
                mstore(_2, shl(224, 0x4e487b71))
                mstore(4, 0x41)
                revert(_2, 0x24)
            }
            // modifies 64; but this is redundant
            mstore(64, newFreePtr)
            data := _1
            // does not modify or read memory location 64
            mstore(_1, returndatasize())
            // does not modify or read memory location 64
            returndatacopy(160, _2, returndatasize())
        }
        return(add(data, 0x20), mload(data))
    }
}
```

A solver based approach may work for this. A rough idea is the following

1. We encode all `mstore(x, y)`.
2. We encode an expression that reads from memory (similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10681). By using a solver, we try to prove if it doesn't read from `x`, if the solver can't prove it we assume it reads from `x`.
3. If none of the expressions reads from the memory `x`, we can safely remove `mstore(x, y)` (provided `y` is side effect free.)

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
