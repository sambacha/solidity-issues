This PR separates yul parsing from optimisation in the test framework.

Required by #10603

@hrkrshnn Regarding your comment (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10699#discussion_r549660291), the additional steps added in this PR for `fuzzer_mode` did produce different optimised snippets (at least they didn't exactly match, I didn't take a closer look) and hence the flag. Would you like to see what this changes are? There are tens of test cases that are different though.

My main intention here is to keep the status quo while permitting fuzzing to take place in parallel. We could make them uniform in a follow-up PR where the test differences can be reviewed in greater detail?

Here are the tests that need to be updated if the so called `fuzzer_mode` is unconditionally enabled (https://gist.github.com/bshastry/78c8746806c95e3cdb441329a6f340a3)

@hrkrshnn pointed out that `fuzzer_mode` is not necessary and that the newly introduced changes may be run unconditionally even in the yul test framework. He also pointed out that @ekpyron was also in favour of at least running FLIR where necessary. The other step that is necessary as a pre-req is FunctionHoister for cases when fuzzer synthesizes a function definition inside another function definition.

If that is the case, I could (in this or a follow up PR) get rid of `fuzzer_mode` and update tests accordingly.

@bshastry are you waiting for @hrkrshnn 's input?

@leonardoalt Yes, if @hrkrshnn approves and there is no veto against the approach taken by this PR from @ekpyron and @chriseth I'd believe this one is good to be merged.

This looks good. But I think it's nice to merge both the refactoring along with just enabling the `fuzzer_mode` part by default, i.e., without the `if`s at the same time.

Do you mean just remove the `fuzzer_mode` and have the test framework execute the same sequence of tests for unit tests as well and update tests?

Yes. It's fine to do this in a separate PR, and we can merge them together.

Approach looks good in general, but I did not take a deep look.
