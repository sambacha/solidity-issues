## Description

You cannot tell whether

                      "attributes":
                      {
                        "isConstant": false,
                        "isLValue": false,
                        "isPure": false,

                        "type": "bytes calldata slice"
                      },
                      "children":
                      [
                        {
                          "attributes":
                          {
                            "overloadedDeclarations":
                            [
                              null
                            ],
                            "referencedDeclaration": 4,
                            "type": "bytes calldata",
                            "value": "foo"
                          },
                          "id": 9,

                        },
                        {
                          "attributes":
                          {
                            "hexvalue": "3233",
                            "isConstant": false,
                            "isLValue": false,
                            "isPure": true,
                            "lValueRequested": false,
                            "token": "number",
                            "type": "int_const 23",
                            "value": "23"
                          },
                          "id": 10,
                          "name": "Literal",
                          "src": "93:2:0"
                        }
                      ],
                      "id": 11,
                      "name": "IndexRangeAccess",
                      "src": "88:8:0"
                    }
```
is part of the AST of source code containing `foo[:23];` or `foo[:23];` because when creating an AST via `solc --ast-json file.sol`, the output is identical (except for literal 23's `src` attribute).


## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.7.4
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): istanbul
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): none (compiled via solc-select)
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: none
- Operating system: Manjaro

Yeah, and that's not the only ambiguity in the legacy JSON AST. We do have a replacement for it which is `--ast-compact-json` so I recommend switching to that. `--ast-json` option has been dropped in 0.8.0 (see #9512 and #10363 for details).

By the way, I noticed that [docs for 0.8.0 still mention `--ast-json`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/using-the-compiler.rst#basic-usage). We'll need to fix that.
