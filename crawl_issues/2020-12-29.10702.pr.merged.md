Looks like a few tests will need updates, + the cli tests

Yes, I will add a Changelog and update the tests. Unfortunately, this is another change in the encoding that causes Z3 to behave differently. Also, there is quite a number of differences between the Linux in CLI and my local OSX.

No, sorry, I meant CI... The differences are only in SMTChecker tests.
