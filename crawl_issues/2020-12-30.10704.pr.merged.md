This PR adds missing type constraints on transaction variables in the contract deployment phase.

Fixes #10703.

Unfortunately, with this change in the encoding, a bug in Z3 causes segfault on many examples in our tests.
This bug has been reported to Z3 developers some time ago (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/4772) and has been fixed already in Z3 master. But we need to wait until a new release of Z3 is out.

@blishko we merged the z3 update, so please install z3 4.8.10 and rebase this, hopefully the crashes will be gone

After the upgrade of Z3, there are no more crashes.
Also, it seems that adding constraints for intermediate expressions in checked blocks solved some of the issues mentioned in #10703.
However, the constraints are still missing in unchecked blocks, so I still believe we should add them to the encoding of the deployment phase as proposed in this PR.
I will try to come up with more tests and check BMC.

Wait, what's the connection to checked/unchecked blocks?

```
void SMTEncoder::defineExpr(Expression const& _e, smtutil::Expression _value)
{
	createExpr(_e);
	solAssert(_value.sort->kind != smtutil::Kind::Function, "Equality operator applied to type that is not fully supported");
	m_context.addAssertion(expr(_e) == _value);

	if (
		auto type = _e.annotation().type;
		m_checked && smt::isNumber(*type)
	)
		m_context.addAssertion(smtutil::Expression::implies(
			currentPathConditions(),
			smt::symbolicUnknownConstraints(expr(_e), type)
		));
}
```
We have this in `defineExpr`, which adds type constraints on Solidity expressions in `checked` blocks, but not in `unchecked` blocks.

Ah right, I added that specifically to "automatically" have the type constraints for arithmetic results without having to add anything to the context inside `arithmeticOperator`

Looks good overall, the only thing I'm not sure are the examples with inheritance and `msg.value` being used in different contracts in the hierarchy. Did you try those on Remix as well?

I have not added any tests with `msg.value` and inheritance hierarchy, but I should add some.
I will test the examples you suggested in our discussion.

LGTM. I feel the test commits may be squashed.

Rebased and squashed.
