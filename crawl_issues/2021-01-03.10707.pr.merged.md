@axic @chriseth btw should this go to `breaking` instead?

It is breaking, as the original issue was labeled. We could support both options in a non-breaking manner (and drop the old in the breaking release), if we want to go as far as that. Not sure it is worth it.

So does the new design support both ":" and "=" for  the separator ?

I think it would be better to support both `:` and `=` for now.

OK. I will update code to implement this.

Hi there

The code is updated to support both ``=`` and ``:``, could you please review again ? Thanks
