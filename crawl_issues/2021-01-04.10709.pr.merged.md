@cameel it does fix the issue, although you claiming that it does not seems to suggest that some more explanation is needed :)

In the example - `int256[5][] TEST=[[100,150,100,0,60],[257,50,80,0,3]]`, the first array literal is `uint8[4]`, while the second is `uint16[4]`. The important piece now is that you cannot do an implicit conversion from `unit8[4]` to `uint16[4]`.

Updated.

@chriseth Well, looks like my assumption about where an implicit conversion happens was wrong.

Before commenting I checked this and it worked:
```solidity
contract C {
    uint16[5] b = [100,150,100,0,60];
}
```

So I guess if a copy happens then technically there's no conversion? Or there's just a conversion between individual elements? I was assuming that it counted as implicit array conversion followed by array copy.

I just checked this
```solidity
contract C {
    function foo() public {
        uint16[5] memory b = [100,150,100,0,60];
    }
}
```

And it does produce an error (`Error: Type uint8[5] memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint16[5] memory.`) so I guess you're right, the thing with storage must be a special case.

It is weird that it does not complain about the next example, though...

Oh, because it has a 'this will not compile' line.
