I added a simple `std::map<SolvingState, LPResult>`-based cache used on split problems (without detecting row or column permutations). On "aztec" it achieves 119 cache misses and 2300 cache hits.
Timings for `soltest -t */*/*aztec*`:
 - without cache: 1.4 seconds
 - with std::map-based cache: 0.7 seconds

Judging from the profiler, the biggest performance problem currently seems to be simplifying the solution, and there, especially, deleting variables, since this is an expensive operation on the vectors. It might be that deleting variables is not that important in the end, since we split anyway, but it might still speed up the other operations.

Some delayed deleting of variables results in a performance of 0.45 seconds now.
