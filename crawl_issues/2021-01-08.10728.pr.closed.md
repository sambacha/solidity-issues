Depends on #10867.

Fixes #6902.

- [X] support for builtin functions.
  - [X] basic builtin functions.
  - [X] basic support to enable usage of builtin functions within expectations.
- [x] implementation of all event specific builtin functions.

- [x] add implicit check for events.
- [x] support automatic expectation generation (easily readable), if events where found but not checked for.

- [ ] add useful builtins that can be used within expectations. (e.g. `contract.address`, `utils.keccak256`) - maybe this should be done in another PR
- [ ] add  log specific expectation builtins e.g. `logs.sender`.
- [ ] move event specific tests from `SolidityEndToEndTests` to semantic tests.

How do you imagine such a test file to look in the end? I think it is not too important to support logs that are not produced by events.

> How do you imagine such a test file to look in the end? I think it is not too important to support logs that are not produced by events.

Given this `SolidityEndToEndTest`:
```cpp
BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE(event_emit)
{
	char const* sourceCode = R"(
contract ClientReceipt {
	event Deposit(address indexed _from, bytes32 indexed _id, uint _value);
	function deposit(bytes32 _id) public payable {
		emit Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
	}
}
	)";
	ALSO_VIA_YUL(
		DISABLE_EWASM_TESTRUN()

		compileAndRun(sourceCode);
		u256 value(18);
		u256 id(0x1234);
		for (bool manually: {true, false})
		{
			callContractFunctionWithValue("deposit(bytes32,bool)", value, id, manually);
			BOOST_REQUIRE_EQUAL(numLogs(), 1);
			BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(logAddress(0), m_contractAddress);
			BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(h256(logData(0)), h256(u256(value)));
			BOOST_REQUIRE_EQUAL(numLogTopics(0), 3);
			BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(logTopic(0, 0), util::keccak256(string("Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)")));
			BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(logTopic(0, 1), h256(m_sender, h256::AlignRight));
			BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL(logTopic(0, 2), h256(id));
		}
	)
}
```
The resulting semantic test may look like this:
```solidity
contract ClientReceipt {
    event Deposit(address indexed _from, bytes32 indexed _id, uint _value);
    function deposit(bytes32 _id) public payable {
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
    }
}
// ====
// compileViaYul: also
// ----
// deposit(bytes32), 18 wei: 0x1234 ->
// logs.numLogs() -> 1
// logs.logAddress(uint256): 0 -> contract.address() 
// logs.logData(uint256): 0 -> 18
// logs.numLogTopics(uint256): 0 -> 3
// logs.logTopic(uint256,uint256): 0, 0 -> utils.keccak256("Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)")
// logs.logTopic(uint256,uint256): 0, 1 -> logs.sender()
// logs.logTopic(uint256,uint256): 0, 2 -> 0x1234
```
It would also be nice to support builtins (e.g. `contract.address`, `utils.keccak256`, `logs.sender`) for the expectations as shown here . But probably we don't need this at least right now.

Without builtins that can be used as expectations this test would look like this:
```solidity
// deposit(bytes32), 18 wei: 0x1234 ->
// logs.numLogs() -> 1
// logs.logAddress(uint256): 0 -> 0x0fdd67305928fcac8d213d1e47bfa6165cd0b87b
// logs.logData(uint256): 0 -> 18
// logs.numLogTopics(uint256): 0 -> 3
// logs.logTopic(uint256,uint256): 0, 0 -> 0x19dacbf83c5de6658e14cbf7bcae5c15eca2eedecf1c66fbca928e4d351bea0f
// logs.logTopic(uint256,uint256): 0, 1 -> 0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012
// logs.logTopic(uint256,uint256): 0, 2 -> 0x1234
```

Please make the test expectation more readable:

After each function that causes an event or a log, add one line per log, that looks as follows:

```
event: [<topic1>, <topic2>, ...] <decoded data> at <address>
```

With the following simplifications:
 - The "at <address>" is removed if the address is the current contract
 - Try to see if the first topic is the hash of an event of the current contract. If you find a matching event, display its signature instead of the value - maybe inside `<>` or something.
 - You can try to decode the data according to the types of the event if you find a matching event - but that could also be a second step.


All emitted events always have to be mentioned. I think we should not make this a query to a builtin that can be there or cannot be there. Instead, the events belong to the function call.

I implemented this with the help of a builtin, but maybe it can be simplified more. I introduced a new builtin `logs.expectEvent(uint256,string)`, where the first parameter is the index of the log, and the second parameter is the signature of the event. This builtin will basically just return the topics and the data.

If we have the following contract:
```solidity
contract ClientReceipt {
    event D(address indexed _from, bytes32 indexed _id, uint _value);
    function deposit(bytes32 _id) public payable {
        emit D(msg.sender, _id, msg.value);
    }
}
```
The test looks right now like this:
```
// ====
// compileViaYul: false
// ----
// deposit(bytes32), 18 wei: 0x1234 ->
// logs.expectEvent(uint256,string): 0, "D(address,bytes32,uint256)" -> 0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012, 0x1234, 18
```
As this is not an anonymous event, the builtin will check whether the provided event signature hash is equal to `topic[0]`. If this is not matching it will generate an error. In this case (non-anonymous event) `topic[0]` will be removed from the output of this builtin to simplify its usage. The builtin will at first output all topics, followed by the data. Here we see at first `0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012`, that is address, followed by `0x1234` that is the `_id` followed by `value`.

If we would change the event `D` to `event D(address _from, bytes32 indexed _id, uint _value);` The expectation would look like this: (address is not indexed and will become part of the data)
```solidity
// logs.expectEvent(uint256,string): 0, "D3(address,bytes32,uint256)" -> 0x1234, 0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012, 18
```

I implemented a simple tracking of event producers and it's consumer. The idea here is that only non-builtins can produce events, and only builtins - especially the `logs` builtins consume events. I know after each contract call what events where produced, and if after this call `logs` builtins where used and what logs where accessed (consumed). In the end I know per non-builtin call what events they produced and what events where consumed subsequent `logs` builtin calls.

This information is used to generate a failure during test execution, if not all produced events where consumed. Right now I only implemented the detection and visualisation that some events where not consumed. You can see this in the failing tests right now, e.g. [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/12403/workflows/fb6d81c1-fd20-4689-b149-f20e62f53d85/jobs/582957). The message will also show the event signature that was matching with the hash defined in `topic[0]`.

> You can try to decode the data according to the types of the event if you find a matching event - but that could also be a second step.

This is exactly what my plan is for tomorrow. Right now I only print the topics, and a big blob of data without interpreting the types.

The only missing thing is right now that I don't support your `at <address>`. I could imagine that probably the creator address is not always important, so we could introduce an additional builtin, e.g. `logs.expectEventAt(uint256,string,address)`, where we can additionally check whether the log was created by that address.

Don't forget that we ideally not just want to have an error, if the logs in the expectations do not match the actually emitted events, but we'd also like to be able to have "(u)pdate" in an ``isoltest`` call automatically produce a complete list... Ideally without touching existing matching entries and only automatically complementing the list of existing event expectations with the auto-generated versions of the missing ones. But I guess you're just missing logic for decoding event data for that so far and wil add that as soon as it's there :-).
