Update `scripts/install_deps.sh` to support `MacOS Big Sur`.

I have verified it in the following computers:

> Mac mini (2018) - MacOS Big Sur 11.1
>
> MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019) - MacOS Big Sur 11.0

Thanks for your review!

Thanks! Unfortunately this script does not go through CI but I see that your change simply enables the same behavior as on the other versions so if it works for you then I guess it should be fine :)
