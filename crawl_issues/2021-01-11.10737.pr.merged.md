@ekpyron well, you used external project, so of course it was going to be easy :) (There's precedent for that in the build system.)

I mean: I still think it's evil and mean, if ``make`` starts downloading stuff :-D. But that applies to *any* use of ``ExternalProject_add`` anyways, so since we already use it, adding a second instance doesn't exactly make it much worse - and once I ultimately convinced all of you of that, we can just change it for all of them at once :-).
