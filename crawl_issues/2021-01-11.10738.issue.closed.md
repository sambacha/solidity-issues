After https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10737 we should be able to replace nearly all non-range-based for loops by range-based loops using appropriate ranges.

oh yes!

And also replace the `boost::algorithm::reverse` iterator? I think ranges-v3 has some functionality for that?

Especially if there is a ``ranges::cpp20::*`` version of any boost range algorithm or boost range adaptor, it'd make sense to switch to the ranges-v3 version.

Two things that should be easy to find and replace are uses of `boost::adaptors::map_keys` and `boost::adaptors::map_values`. That would be `views::keys` and `views::values` now.

Also to be clear in case any external contributor wants to take this: there's no need to find all cases where this can be done at once. We'll gladly accept PRs that change one or two for loops at a time.

``vector_ref``, resp. ``bytesRef`` should also be replaced by ``ranges::span``.

So I did this work but using `std::basic_string_view<uint8_t>`. It is quite a few changes, but simplifies a lot of things. Withheld those PRs are people were saturated with "technical debt" PRs after the "remove u160" thing :wink:

That's immutable, though, isn't it? So while this may work for ``bytesConstRef`` it won't for ``bytesRef``, will it?
``ranges::span``, which will become C++20 ``std::span`` is the better choice in any case... and it'll work in the mutable and immutable case.

Yes, but we didn't actually need mutability in most of the places.

@chriseth, @axic , any suggestion for replacing make_pair in `libsolidity/parsing/DocStringParser.cpp` for replacing find_first_of. Tried couple of things but doesn't work.

I think DocStringParser should in general be rewritten to replace pairs of iterators by something else. Maybe string_view would be the right choice.

There is only one instance left from that list:
test/libsolidity/util/ContractABIUtils.cpp:#include <boost/range/algorithm_ext/for_each.hpp>
And simply changing boost::for_each to std::for_each doesn't compile, so i don't know if we can get rid of it now

How about changing it to an ordinary loop that iterates over the result of `ranges::views::zip()`?

The only two remaining items are:
```
liblangutil//ErrorReporter.h:#include <boost/range/adaptor/filtered.hpp>
solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp:#include <boost/range/adaptor/filtered.hpp>
```
