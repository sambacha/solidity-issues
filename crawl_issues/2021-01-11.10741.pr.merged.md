# [\#10741 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10741) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Synthesize untrusted functions called externally

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-01-11 21:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10741):

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10727

The formatted version looks like this:
```
abstract contract D {
    function d() public virtual ;
}

contract C {
    bool a;
    uint x;
    D d;
    function g() public returns (uint) {
        x = 2;
        d.d();
        return x;
    }
    function f() public {
        x = 1;
        uint y = g();
        assert(x == 2 || x == 1);
    }
    function h() public {
        x = 3;
    }
}

Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
Counterexample:
a = false, x = 3, d = 0
 = 0

Transaction trace:
C.constructor()
State: a = false, x = 0, d = 0
C.g()
  d.d() -- untrusted external call, synthesized as:
    C.h() -- reentrant call
    C.f() -- reentrant call
      C.g() -- internal call
        d.d() -- untrusted external call, synthesized as:
          C.h() -- reentrant call

> LGTM!
> One thing that comes to my mind is: would it be possible to report returned values from the untrusted calls?

I'll check the return value thing. Although sometimes it's also empty because the external function didn't really do anything. I removed the message "synthesized as" if it doesn't lead to any reentrant calls.

@mijovic updated.
@blishko I don't think it's that easy to show the return value of the external call. I would keep that to a different PR.

OK! Just something to consider for the future, I think it would be useful.
