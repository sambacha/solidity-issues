# [\#10742 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10742) `closed`: [Yul Optimizer] CommonSwitchPrefixMover

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10739
Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6726
So far it neither checks for reverting code paths or does the suggested split in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6726 in case not all, but only some cases share the prefix.
Not sure how likely it is to happen in this ways and thus how useful this is...

This is actually a bug in the check_style script... (it thinks it's an ``if`` with a ``{`` on the same line, but the ``{`` belongs to the lambda...)... but I didn't want to bother looking at the regex, so I split into multiple lines...

Also I actually only read the issue after I wrote this, so I didn't handle the case where not all, but only some cases share the prefix - but I'll probably change it to handle those cases, because without it, this might happen quite rarely.

Actually, maybe it makes sense to keep this almost as it is, only extending it by disregarding any cases that always revert.

Based on that we could have a separate ``SwitchCaseGrouper`` that transforms a switch with common prefix in some cases to a nested switch like suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6726, but which does not yet actually move the prefix. That may be easier than doing all of it in a single step.

So yeah, I think this should basically be fine and safe and beneficial under all circumstances - but it's unlikely to actually hit anything, so it'll be rather useless like this.
To make it more useful we need to track "ambient control flow", i.e. have a step that determines that any control flow after a given statement will revert in some specific way.
Once we have that, instead of requiring a default case in the switch here, we can also allow moving when the ambient control flow reverts - although we have to be careful when moving reverts out, since they might have different messages. Also in these cases some heuristic about when this is beneficial and when it isn't might be required.

So not sure if we still want to merge this as is or not.

So yeah - I'm not sure about what to do with this. Either someone should review it to make sure it works and is correct and we just merge it, or we close it, since without taking into account "ambient revert control flow", this probably won't help much in practice.
On the other hand it also doesn't really hurt - the step should be cheap (it'll abort on the first mismatch in switch cases) and it will basically stay the same once we have another step calculating ambient control flow.
So I'd say we can just merge it, but I'm fine either way.

Sorry, I got a bit carried away with a pending PR of mine. I will take another look at this PR today.

The following test case results in invalid code

```
object "object0" {
	code {
		{
			for { let i_0 := 0 } lt(i_0, 0x60) { i_0 := add(i_0, 0x20) } {
				switch 0x40001
				case 0x4001 {
					let x_3, x_4, x_5
					function foo_n_2()
					{
					let x_7, x_8, x_9
					}
					foo_n_2()
				}
				default {
					let x_11, x_12, x_13
					function foo_n_10()
					{
					let x_15, x_16, x_17
					}
					foo_n_10()
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
// ----
// step: commonSwitchCasePrefixMover
```

is optimised to

```
    {
        {
            for { let i_0 := 0 } lt(i_0, 0x60) { i_0 := add(i_0, 0x20) }
            {
                let x_3, x_4, x_5
                function foo_n_2()
                { let x_7, x_8, x_9 }
                switch 0x40001
                case 0x4001 { foo_n_2() }
                default { foo_n_10() }
            }
        }
    }
```

Somehow `foo_n_10()` is not replaced by `foo_n_2()`

Well, the function hoister is a declared requirement of this step :-). Still, not bad to find that - but yeah, it won't rename function names, because it can assume that they won't change, since functions are assumed to be pre-hoisted :-). Might still be a nice touch to assert against this.

I think the fuzzer found this while running the step in this PR by itself (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10742/files#diff-73622bb8919a08b5f6a1bf2e72da8fd56c6f8d1ba4cf939db12c573dbadf95b5R361-R363). Would it be reasonable to invoke function hoister there before making a call to this step? That will avoid false positives from the fuzzer pov.

The PR itself looks good to me, other than requiring a rebase. I'd vote for merging since we can always incrementally make it more sophisticated as we go along.

Rebased... although this is still pretty much hanging in limbo, since it's not particularly useful on its own, so still not sure... I'm still fine with just closing it for now, but there still also shouldn't be much harm in just merging it. Both fine with me.

So, hm... this is now hitting a few more tests actually, but the gas results are in fact not always favourable...

Since it doesn't seem like we're going to merge this any time soon, I'm closing this for now.
