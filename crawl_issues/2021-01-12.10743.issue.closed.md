# [\#10743 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10743) `closed`: External calls with "view: true" attribute

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2900574?v=4" width="50">[vporton](https://github.com/vporton) opened issue at [2021-01-12 01:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10743):

## Abstract

In existing Solidity there is no way to make an external call from a view function (when the external function is also view), except of using `staticcall` feature. It should be doable without using this hard to use feature.

## Specification

It should be added new `view` boolean parameter to external calls to be used like:

`who.f{view: true}(...);`

`view` could be only the constant `false` or `true` (not an arbitrary boolean value).

If `view` is `true` then the external call to be considered as a read-only operation.

I'm not sure this is true. The following code is valid:

```
contract C {
    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256){
        return this.retrieve();
    }
}
```

Are you saying you want to force the use of `staticcall` even on functions that are not view functions?

I've realized that there was an error in my report. Ignore it, closing the issue.
