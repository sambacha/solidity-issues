Argh... I forgot that the docker images try a build and this immediately needs the build system updates in the same PR... that's not a good setup actually, because that'll make CI fail in this PR...

All appears to be good. We could have a closer look at the CI artifact and check for performance changes, etc. - but I think this should generally be fine. CI seems to be faster or slower depending on the run, so I'd generally not expect much difference. Size is slightly larger, but didn't change significantly.

For the record: I did load it into remix in firefox and chrome and find any issues, but also didn't test exhaustively.

Hm... bytecode comparison complaining is actually rather concerning, though.

It appears to "only" be hashing in the metadata, though...
In particular the ipfs hash mismatches, because the swarm source hash in the metadata mismatches from what I can see...

Interestingly, both the keccak and the swarm hashes match, though, so it actually has to be the implementation of the swarm hash producing different results for the same input...
Generally I could imagine some 32-bit vs 64-bit weirdness, but that should have been noticable before the update as well... and it doesn't use boost from what I see... so it's actually rather weird...

The last commit should fix it.
For the record: quote https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/operator_arithmetic#Shift_operators 
"The behavior is undefined if rhs is negative or is greater or equal the number of bits in the promoted lhs."

Since wasm builds are 32-bit, size_t is 32-bit, so half of the shifts were undefined. Apparently old emscripten still used the "usual" shift semantics, i.e. all of this is zero, but new emscripten (respectively the new default optimization settings new emscripten uses) changes that.

Yep, all passes now.
