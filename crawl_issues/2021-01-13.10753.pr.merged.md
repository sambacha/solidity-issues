# [\#10753 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10753) `merged`: Fix YulUtilFunctions::negateNumberWrappingFunction

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-01-13 14:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10753):

Fixes `flipping_sign_tests` found by #10235, which was miscompiled as:
```
            function negate_t_int256(value) -> ret {
            value := cleanup_t_int256(sub(0, value)))
        }
```

e.g. missing the closing `}` which broke the entire yul.

So this test actually doesn't match. Will add a simple test case so we can merge this.

Yeah, just saw that the test is actually failing...

Can't seem to trigger that code being generated, even though it should happen on an unary negation in an integer type under unchecked arithmethics. But `unchecked { y = -x; }` just won't cut it. Neither `unchecked { assert(-x == (0 - x)); }`.

Will submit more tests for checked vs. unchecked in the new IR separately.

Why test the new IR separately? The tests can all be shared between old and new codegen, can't they? We just need to make sure it's enough and they're all enabled for both...

Apparently the tests have run exactly around midnight and while most builds finished before, the osx build finished only after, so we get ``2021.1.13+commit.c15c6d26`` vs ``2021.1.14+commit.c15c6d26`` as version, yielding to mismatching metadata, triggering the bytecode comparison failure. Rerunning should fix it :-).

I meant will submit more tests separately, e.g. new PR, as it needs more work and found some weird things.

Right because due to some CI intermittent issue the `b_osx` build failed (missing commit or something), so retriggered built from failed. Which was after midnight.
