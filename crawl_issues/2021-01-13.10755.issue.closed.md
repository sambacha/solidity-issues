The following contract:

```solidity
  struct MyStruct {
	  uint x;
	  uint y;
	  uint z;
  }

  contract C {
	  function f() public {
		  MyStruct memory s;
	  }
  }
```

produces the optimized-ir

```
let _1 := 0
if eq(0x26121ff0, shr(224, calldataload(_1)))
{
    if callvalue() { revert(_1, _1) }
    if slt(add(calldatasize(), not(3)), _1) { revert(_1, _1) }
    let memPtr := allocateMemory(96)
    mstore(memPtr, _1)
    mstore(add(memPtr, 32), _1)
    mstore(add(memPtr, 64), _1)
    return(allocateMemory(_1), _1))
}
```
We should be able to avoid the three `mstores`, which are zero-ing out the struct values in memory. Possibly related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10690

Is this the "assume memory is initially zero" issue? Note that we cannot assume that the allocator returns "fresh" memory.

What do you mean? Is this because of inline assembly, or can it happen with regular code?

It can happen with regular code. There are some routines that only need temporary memory - they don't increment the free memory pointer afterwards.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
