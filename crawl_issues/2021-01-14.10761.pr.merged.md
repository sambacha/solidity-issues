So this will affect jump labels and we need input in how best to deal with that. So first a summary of what is happening here:

With this PR, whenever there is a JUMP(tag) to a tag at which there are only a few opcodes in straight, simple control-flow followed by another JUMP, it will remove the jump to the tag and copy the opcodes up to that JUMP in its place.

If both the first jump we replace and the jump at the end of the block we replace it with are "Ordinary" jumps, then the resulting jump is also just an "Ordinary" jump and nothing special happens, but if one or both of them were jumps into- or out-of a function, things get more complicated.

The following situations can occur:

| Original Jump to be replaced | Jump at end of Block originally jumped to | Jump in resulting inlined code | Comment
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------
| Ordinary                                 | Ordinary                                                     | Ordinary                                  | Nothing special but one jump less.
| Ordinary                                 | Into Function                                              | Into Function                            | Nothing special but one jump less.
| Ordinary                                 | Out of Function                                          | Out of Function                        | Nothing special but one jump less.
| Into Function                          | Ordinary                                                     | Into Function                            | This means there will be source locations from inside the function before the jump into the function
| Into Function                          | Into Function                                              | WILL NOT INLINE                 | We could inline here, but this would change the balance of Into-Function and Out-of-Function jumps - i.e. the situation is that the first thing ``f`` does is to call ``g``, originally we have a jump to ``f``, then a jump to ``g``, but now we directly jump to ``g``, but we will later still see *two* "Out of function" jumps, misaligning the balance.
| Into Function                          | Out of Function                                          | Ordinary                              | This is "traditional" inlining of an entire function. This means in a code block source locations of a function will occur without any jump into or out of this function
| Out of Function                      | Ordinary                                                     | Out of Function                            | This means there will be source locations from outside the function at the end of the function before the jump out.
| Out of Function                      | Into Function                                               | Ordinary                                      | This can happen if two functions are called directly after each other. Instead of jumping out of one and into the other, we jump directly from one to the other. This means source locations will flip from one function to another function at an ordinary jump. In total the Jump-Into-Jump-Out-Of balance will be preserved, though.
| Out of Function                      | Out of Function                                               | WILL NOT INLINE                 | Analog to the Into-Function-Into-Function case. Can happen if the last thing a function does is calling another function. Instead of first returning from one and then from the other, one jump returns from both. We could inline here, but also not without disturbing the "Jump-Into-Jump-out-of"-total-balance.


So the first question is: how much of a problem is this for tooling already :-)?
Further questions would be: How much bigger of a problem would this be if we also inlined in the "Into-Into"-Function and "Out-of-Out-of"-Function cases?
Is there anything better we can do?

Generally, after this PR the function begining or end will no longer necessarily be tied to jumps. Actually, though, I'm not sure why those jump labels are actually needed - wouldn't looking at the source locations before and after a jump have been enough before a PR? If so that would mean looking at source locations would still be sufficient after this PR, but there's probably more to it - maybe the stack layout of arguments and return variables? This will only be guaranteed to match the expected layout between the "jump-in" and "jump-out" jumps after this PR, independently of whether source locations are already inside the function - and in the "out-of-into"-case the stack layout would change at an ordinary jump inside the function, at which the layout switches from the usual one from one function to the one of the next. Would it be more helpful to still mark this as jump "into" the next function, even though there will only be one jump-out for two jump-in's this way?

Would it be a helpful replacement of jump labels to mark arbitrary instructions instead of jumps as "into"- and "out-of"-functions?

So the optimizer step itself should work and be correct, but we're not sure how to deal with this part :-).

Another note: only inlining in the "ordinary-*" cases (they should not affect tooling at all) and in the "into-out-of" case, i.e. inlining an entire function in place, would already make this step quite useful and solve the loop increment issue that triggered this.
So the first important question is whether *that* would cause tooling issues; the rest can have lower priority and easily be postponed until after 0.8.1 and discussed further.

Hm, so, Truffle Debugger already has lots of problems with optimized code; I can't speak for writers of other tools, of course.  So yeah this might cause problems for locating variables but, like, every optimization does.  I could go into detail about exactly how it might make things worse, but I'll skip that for now I think.

I imagine the bigger problem is the question of to what extent this would mess up stack traces, since there are a larger number of tools out there that do that (and see also #10715 for a different example of a recent way the optimizer can mess up stack traces), and that's something people might expect to work a bit more robustly.

So, let's go through the cases here and see what problems this would cause for stacktracing (let's imagine that the code in that segment reverts for some reason).

* Case `--`: No problem here, obviously.
* Case `-i`: Ditto.
* Case `-o`: Ditto.
* Case `i-`: The source location will show a point in the function called, but there won't be a stackframe for it, it'll still show the caller.  In particular, it won't show where in the caller the call happened.  This is... not great.  Exactly how bad is it?  I don't know, maybe someone else can answer that better.
* Case `ii`: Not inlined, so no problem. :)  If it were to be inlined, it would have the problem of case `i-`, with the additional problems caused by unbalancing (that could mess up strack traces for reverts occuring anywhere later in the transaction).
* Case `io`: Similar to case `i-`.
* Case `o-`: The source location will show a point in the function returned to, but the called function won't have been popped from the stack yet.  This doesn't strike me as as big a problem as the problem of `i-`, since while it might be a little confusing, there's not really the same level of information loss.
* Case `oi`: This case has the problems of case `o-`, but also has the additional problem that any reverts from within the second function call will show as coming from the first function call (although of course they'll still have correct source location), with nothing to show where the common caller made that second function call.  Blech.  So this is case kind of combines the problems of `o-` with the problems of `i-`, except that the latter is worse than in case `i-`, since there it only applies within a small segment, whereas here it applies for the entire duration of the second function call.
* Case `oo`: Not inlined, so no problem. :)  If it were to be inlined, it would have the problems of case `o-`, with the additional problems caused by unbalancing (that could mess up strack traces for reverts occuring anywhere later in the transaction).

I guess the question of how much of a problem all this is is to a substantial extent a question of how well people expect tools to work with otimized code.

> Further questions would be: How much bigger of a problem would this be if we also inlined in the "Into-Into"-Function and "Out-of-Out-of"-Function cases?

Is there a way to make sure you only do those in matching pairs around the same call?

Otherwise, unbalancing things is going to result in bad stack traces if the revert happens anywhere after the unbalance, in ways that are probably worse than the problems I described above.

I mean, unless you want to add a way to indicate "this jump corresponds to n jumps in/out" instead of just one. :P

> Is there anything better we can do?

> Would it be a helpful replacement of jump labels to mark arbitrary instructions instead of jumps as "into"- and "out-of"-functions?

(going a bit out of order here :) )

I'd be all for that!  Indeed I think I've asked about this before, for the purpose of marking the beginnings and endings of functions that don't currently use jumps, such as constructors and fallback functions.  (And there's the whole mess with modifiers, but *those* probably shouldn't use such markings, because those are more complicated.  I don't really have a great idea how to handle those; some sort of separate "start of modifier" marking...?)

Of course, doing this might break tooling that isn't ready for it.  But I personally am all for it.  Adding support for it in Truffle Debugger wouldn't be hard.  (I imagine adding support for it in other tools wouldn't be hard either...)

> Generally, after this PR the function begining or end will no longer necessarily be tied to jumps. Actually, though, I'm not sure why those jump labels are actually needed - wouldn't looking at the source locations before and after a jump have been enough before a PR?

I will say that jump labels are definitely very helpful.  Trying to go based on comparing source locations... well, it might be doable, but it'd have a number of caveats.  (Just off the top of my head, one would have to make sure that all of this worked correctly with modifiers, with base constructors, with getters, with initializers, with unmapped code...)  I mean even just determining which function a given source range falls in isn't trivial, you know?  Truffle Debugger might be able to handle this, given all the crazy stuff it already does, but I expect writers of other tools, who are probably trying to keep them simple, rather than monstrosities of special cases, would really not appreciate such a change.

I would also in general expect such a method to not necessarily work for optimized code, whose source mappings seem to often work in unexpected ways.

> If so that would mean looking at source locations would still be sufficient after this PR, but there's probably more to it - maybe the stack layout of arguments and return variables? This will only be guaranteed to match the expected layout between the "jump-in" and "jump-out" jumps after this PR, independently of whether source locations are already inside the function - and in the "out-of-into"-case the stack layout would change at an ordinary jump inside the function, at which the layout switches from the usual one from one function to the one of the next. Would it be more helpful to still mark this as jump "into" the next function, even though there will only be one jump-out for two jump-in's this way?

Truffle Debugger at least doesn't use jump markings for this purpose, so that at least would not be a problem.  Mind you, it gets variable locations wrong all the time when dealing with optimized code, so perhaps I should instead say it wouldn't be any more of a problem, but the point is, it wouldn't be any more of a problem.

Although, while it doesn't use jump markings for determining where variables are located, it does use them for determining what variables are active.  I don't think this should cause *too* much of a problem, but there would at least be some problems there.  For instance, if a function `f` made multiple inlined calls to `g`, then on the second inlined call to `g`, its variables would show up, with incorrect values, before they were declared.  Similarly, if instead of the calls to `g` being inlined, there was a case `oi` where the return to `f` and then second jump into `g` were what was inlined, the same problem would occur.

Oh wait, actually, `i-` would cause a problem too.  Since if this happens when `f` calls `g`, this could possibly cause early variables of `g` declared in the inlined segment (like, say, the parameters) to get associated with the wrong stack frame, and so they wouldn't display for the duration of `g`.  Blech.  I can at least think of a way to possibly fix that one, unlike the cases above, but, oy.  And actually I suppose the same thing could happen with `o-`, if any variables got declared in the inlined segment there.  That case doesn't seem fixable, unfortunately.

So, those are the problems that Truffle Debugger would have with it.

Obviously, I can't speak for what Remix does or whether it might mess their debugger up, or any other debuggers.

Unbalancing jump-ins and jump-outs seems really bad, though, as mentioned above, for anyone that's just trying to make stack tracing work, let alone anything more complicated.

So as a summary, @haltman-at , does the following work?
 - it is optimized code, so it is fine if some metadata gets lost, as long as it is not too bad.
 - as long as we do not destroy the in/out balance, it's probably fine, even though some variable information might get lost
 - let us think of better debugging annotations we can use in the future.

What do the others think?

That seems like a fair summary, yes.  I'd be more worried about the effects on stack traces than the effects on variables.

Sorry for the late answer.
Here are some early feedback:

> Generally, after this PR the function begining or end will no longer necessarily be tied to jumps

That will be a problem for us ( `i-`, `o-` ) because jump in function are at the moment also identified using source location and JUMP mark. So I am pretty sure that will break our analyzer. But might be good time for us to switch to a better solution.
`jump labels to mark arbitrary instructions instead of jumps as "into"- and "out-of"-functions` will just solve the issue.

As far as I can see, `io` could also be an issue. I m not sure how we will be able to know when we are stepping inside a function, if there's no `into-`, `out-of` tags.
`oi` also, that's vital to be aware of stepping out of a function.

> - wouldn't looking at the source locations before and after a jump have been enough before a PR?

Not really, well that could work, but jump label is for us far more accurate.

> Would it be a helpful replacement of jump labels to mark arbitrary instructions instead of jumps as "into"- and "out-of"-functions?

This could solve all the issues you've mentioned. Would be important I think to include `mark arbitrary instructions` in the release that will ship this PR and to give us time to integrate the changes.

After some more experimenting with this I now restricted this PR to the "io" case (i.e. inlining entire functions) only. That's the most beneficial case and the one I'd expect to be least destructive for debuggers (worst case is the debugger will be confused for a few instructions, but should hopefully be able to recover). The second-most-beneficial case I found to be "ii", but since that will break the balance of stack frames, we can postpone it until we have better more generalized debugging output for this.

CI is still building soljson.js for this current version. A canonical test case for checking debugger behaviour would be https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/21b9a22652943f45a5de36db88ad39cc850ecb3f/test/cmdlineTests/optimizer_inliner_inc/input.sol - ``unsafe_inc`` will be inlined with the changes in this PR.

I just updated this to split the tag data into subId and tag everywhere and to only ever consider tags referring to the local subassembly (I think we could never have inlined across subassemblys anyways and this way push counting and tag tracking should be more robust).

I also pass in the externally referenced tags, s.t. we can consider them in the heuristics.

Also I addressed most of the other comments I think, so mainly missing are tests and docs I hope.

@haltman-at @yann300 So as you can see we merged this yesterday, so tonight's nightly release should include this in case you want to have another look before it's released.

The final version is restricted to only inline the "jump-in-jump-out" case, i.e. only entire functions will be inlined for the time being (we will extend this sooner or later, though, including to cases like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10761#discussion_r570258200).

We decided to go ahead without first defining new debugging output, since we noticed that the other steps in the optimizer will already ignore the fact that jumps have jump labels and may remove jumps into- or out-of- functions already, so we're not introducing a new problem with this PR, but we're "just" making an existing problem worse - so given that and the fact that the gas savings of this can be significant and it is required for zero-cost workarounds for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10698, we thought it worthwhile to merge now.
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10929 also added some (minimal) documentation about this.

By now it seems clear that we want to define debugging data that specifies function entries and exits on a more fine-grained level, but it's not yet entirely clear what information we want exactly and in what form (Do we *only* want something equivalent to jump labels on opcode level? Do we also want information about the function entry being "complete", i.e. the arguments and return values being initialized on stack? In general what do we do if opcodes shared among several functions is collapsed? How best to try and make this robust against potential future optimizations? Etc.) - we have a forum topic around the topic of debugging information in general (see https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/debugging-information/77) and can hopefully come up with something soon.
