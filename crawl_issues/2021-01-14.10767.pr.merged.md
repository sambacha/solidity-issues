@mijovic @chriseth I think this will be the final batch for the IR, the unimplemented features? :)

So apparently nothing is triggered by tests?

Looks like nothing from tests is unimplemented :-)

We have more than 10 places with `solUnimplementedAssert`. Are these just not tested or this PR is broken?

Some are also unimplemented in the old codegen (immutables with non-value types), some could maybe be triggered.
