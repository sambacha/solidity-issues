Depends on #11271.
Fixes #10349
Only util function is implemented and should be used everywhere. Right now it is used only in one place...

Conversions to memory happen as the `closestTemporaryType` for `StringLiteralType` in case when we assign it to storage is `bytes memory`
So we need to do copy to memory and then copy to storage for both:
- contract c { bytes m = "abc"; }
- contract c { bytes m; function f() public pure { m = "abc"; }

I can remove unnecessary conversion by implementing specfic `closestTemporaryType` for `StringLiteralType` and then we will end up in `copyToStorage` generic function and we will be able to copy literal directly to storage.
Problem with this is that it will break old codegen which I am fine with if I just call IR implementation to copy literal to storage.

Any other opinion or suggestion @ekpyron @chriseth ?

Doesn't the old codegen avoid conversion to closest temporary type?

I had a quick look through the code, and I have the impression that the whole mobileType / closestTemporaryType mechanism can be reworked. It might have served a better purpose in the past, but it seems it's mostly used for RationalNumberTypes.

Maybe we can also get rid of the 'isPointer' property of reference types - the lvalue mechanism should actually already cover this.

It might be possible to just remove the conversion in the assignment, and I think we should also implement a new function similar to mobileType / closestTemporaryType and remove the other two.

I need to figure out why compound operators are broken with this change in assignment operator. Than it will be ready.
Also, good thing is that this PR does also optimize copy of `calldata slices` to `storage` in `IR`, as before it was converting slices first to `memory`, than from `memory` to `storage` as the `closestTemporaryType` for slice was `memory array`

Rebased, and inlined usage of `closestTemporaryType` in legacy codegen.

The test failures are gas cost changes - surprising ones actually, seems like this can tip both ways.

Please be careful, you are not doing a mere refactoring of the IR codegen here. Before, we first converted the right hand side and then visited the left hand side.

I moved conversion upper, where it was before, just before visiting left hand side.
For reference types I didn't do conversion, which leads to direct conversion to target type which should be fine?

Last commit I have added introduced resize mode for arrays. In case of rewriting array which happens when we do assignment, it decreases gas cost. For now It is used only in case of copying literal to storage, and shows actual gas improvements...
If that is a good direction I can finish resizeArray function properly.

Splitting up the array size change functions is a very good idea, but I think using a flag makes this rather difficult to understand.

Maybe we should have a fully independent `delete array` function and could the push/pop versions be implemented by calling `increment/decrement` directly?

Makes sense. I will create `deleteArray` function that will delete elements of array up to some length. In case of delete it would be `0`, and in case of overwrite it will be `new length`. In case of push pop we can call special increment decrement functions.

Should delete (I mean delete everything) be its own function?
