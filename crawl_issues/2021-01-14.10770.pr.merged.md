# [\#10770 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10770) `merged`: Special case for development version in doc pragma checker

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-01-14 16:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10770):

This solves the problem raised in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10682#discussion_r547279182.

Now the script no longer fails if the earliest version supported by a code snippet is the one we're building right now. It does not run that version though - it's possible but with some complications - I'd have to choose one of platforms to depend on and pass the executable through the workspace in CI.

I have removed the hack that makes it ignore versions ending with `.99` as it should not be necessary now.
