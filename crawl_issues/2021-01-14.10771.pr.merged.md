# [\#10771 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10771) `merged`: Commit date in CI build version strings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-01-14 17:00](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10771):

Using build date results in bytecode mismatch if different executables end up being built on different dates, which happens suprisingly often. I can list at least 3 recent instances of this that happened either when someone pushed code just before midnight or when failed build jobs were restarted not on the same day: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9555#issuecomment-735759352, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10753#issuecomment-760047855, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10582#issuecomment-744300819.

This PR switches to using commit date. Which could sometimes be a lot earlier than the build date but I don't think it matters in CI. But just to be safe, I'm changing the `develop` prefix in version string to `ci` in CI builds.
