# [\#10772 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10772) `merged`: Fix commit date command for CI builds on macOS

Turns out BSD date has different options than the one on Linux so #10771 is broken on macOS. This PR makes it portable.

Okay, I changed the Windows build script, I hope this will work. I have never written a line of PowerShell before so this is an extreme crash course under time pressure :) I hope it won't blow up :)

So apparently printing to a file with `>` results with UTF-16 text with BOM and the build fails while trying to read that. `out-file -encoding ascii prerelease.txt` seems to work correctly so trying that now.

Windows build is fine now but I see that the comparison still fails because of emscripten. I thought it used `build.sh` too but apparently not.

Looks like all bytecode-releated tests are passing so this should finally be good to go.
