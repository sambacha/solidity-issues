# [\#10777 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10777) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix BMC crash related to `unchecked` blocks

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-01-15 10:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10777):

This PR adds a fix for a problem in BMC engine where inlining of a function call does not reset the `checked` flag. This led to a crash before BMC would see this as "nested" unchecked blocks, which violated the invariant asserted in the code.

Fixes #10712.
