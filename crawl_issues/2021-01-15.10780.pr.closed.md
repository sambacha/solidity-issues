# [\#10780 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10780) `closed`: Force even more semantic tests for the IR

The modifiers ones are likely correctly disabled, as some semantic differences are present. We should however verify these tests one by one.

My brief assessment:
- calldata_array_dynamic_bytes: would be nice to check if the stack too deep error can be solved
- negative_stack_height: probably not relevant due to different codegen?
- dirty_memory_bytes_to_storage_copy: likely correctly disabled (mentioned in the ir breaking changes)
- function_entry_checks_v1: likely correctly disabled (it is old abi encoder based)
- function_modifier_loop: likely correctly disabled
- function_modifier_multi_with_return: likely correctly disabled
- function_modifier_multi_invocation: likely correctly disabled
