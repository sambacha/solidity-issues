**Labels**: `good first issue`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-01-15 15:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10784):

At the time of writing the list of the still failing ones is this one: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10390#issuecomment-760994515

The rest should work at least with ``ALSO_VIA_YUL { DISABLE_EWASM_TESTRUN() ... }``.

A few of them test against cpp implemenations, they can stay, the rest might as well be immediately extracted.

Ping @axic.
