`msg.value` is implemented in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10828 when > 0, but it would be nice to also implement the others, when they're used.
An idea is, for every function in the transaction trace, if a `block`, `msg` or `tx` variable is used (can be detected syntactically), show its value in the transaction function call.
