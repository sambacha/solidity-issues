# [\#10791 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10791) `merged`: Use committer date in CI build version strings on Windows

Related to #10771. Fixes #10772.

In #10772 I followed @ekpyron's suggestion and used git command with `%cm` format (rather than my initial `%am`) but then I had to revert to my original fix on Windows and then forgot to swtch to `%cm` in it too. This PR fixes that.

Of the two, I think that the committer date is preferable. The commit can change during rebase after all. Also the moment of the last rebase changes more often and is closer to the current time.

Note that the author date of the only commit in this PR is on purpose in the past - I want to make sure that `t_bytecode_compare` passes in that situation.
