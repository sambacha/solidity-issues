~**NOTE: This PR is based on #10792 and should not be merged before it.**~ It's on `develop` now.

This is the extra, optional cleanup for the scripts for checking and reporting code style errors. It contains the relevant bits from #10585 and #10586 and a few more things. This is not everything that can be done here but that's the part I managed to finish today and is complete enough to be a PR of its own.

Oh, this one is actually not blocked by anything. Switching back to "ready to review".

@leonardoalt We have an answer now. I'll change it but this PR is ready to merge now so I think it's better to merge it and update this rule in a new one.
