# [\#10801 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10801) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Gather local variables also from nested try/catch clauses

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-01-18 10:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10801):

Fixes the problem when gathering parameters from try/catch clauses did not proceed inside the body of the clauses, which ignored nested try/catch statements.

Fixes #10793.

Looks good. I think we should add some assertions to the nested cases though, to check that the control flow is correct.

OK. Should we keep the minimal examples or is it fine to only have more complex ones with assertions?

Can you rebase to take the other SMT PR I merged earlier into account?
