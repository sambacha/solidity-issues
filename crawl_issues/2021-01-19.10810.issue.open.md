**Labels**: `optimizer`, `epic effort`, `high impact`, `must have`

The ReasoningAnalazer is an optimizer component to be used as a base class. It traverses the AST and records relations between SSA variables (it ignores everything that is not an SSA variable) and the state of storage and memory using a reasoning engine. The reasoning engine is exchangeable: It can use both an LP solver and an SMT solver.
