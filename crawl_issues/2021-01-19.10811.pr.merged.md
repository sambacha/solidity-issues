In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10603, I plan to use the lambda map keyed with optimiser step name to randomly select an optimiser step to fuzz. The selection will be made using an unsigned integer which will avoid a specification of optimiser steps maintained by the fuzzer. Please see the discussion in #10603 for more context.
