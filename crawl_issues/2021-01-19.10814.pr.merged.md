@cameel do you want to take this over?

It would be weird if I approved it myself so maybe @Marenz, @bshastry or @aarlt can take another look? :)

The change I just pushed is just a tiny tweak (unnecessary quotes in `[[ ]]`).

While I'm at it, I also added skip/edit options like in isoltest and made the script ask about update for wrong exit code too. I decided to put it in a separate PR though, since we're almost done here: #10832.

@bshastry We don't. The script as a whole will run in CI but the part inside `if [[ $INTERACTIVE != "" ]]` will be skipped. I only tested it locally.
