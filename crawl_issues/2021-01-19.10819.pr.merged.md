# [\#10819 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10819) `merged`: CI job for running Python unit tests

**NOTE: This PR is based on #10822. Please don't merge until that one is merged.**

This job runs the new unit tests introduced in #10675.

I'm running it also on Windows because I want to add some tests for #10676 that ensure that newlines are processed in the same way on CRLF platforms too.

EDIT: Turns out that the tests were not passing on Windows so I have rebased this PR on #10822 which fixes those issues.

Looks like bytecode comparison passed. I just pushed small tweaks now but they should not really change the result. This is now ready for review.

The command to run the Python tests locally on your machine (`PYTHONPATH="scripts/:$PYTHONPATH" python -m unittest discover --start-directory test/scripts/`) is pretty cumbersome so I added a wrapper script that does it. Now it can be executed from any directory and as a bonus the command is now identical on Windows (which was a bit tricky to get right).

I'm moving the PR back to draft for a moment because now that I pushed it, I need to resolve the CI failures.

@hrkrshnn I just merged #10822 and looks like it dismissed your review :|

The change I just pushed is just a minor comment fix (`will executed` -> `will be executed`).

`python3.exe` fails right away though haha

Yeah :)
```
python3.exe : The term 'python3.exe' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable 
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.
```

Changed back.
