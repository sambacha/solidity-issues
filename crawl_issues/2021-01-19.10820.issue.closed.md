Certain `SolidityEndToEndTest`s check the generated bytecode. Similarly in some cases CLI tests are used for the same.

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10807/files#r559757068 such a case came up and it could not be moved to semantic tests given this limitation.

The semantic tests could be extended to have a way assert on generated code: the line `bytecode: <pattern>` would match the constructor code, and `deployedBytecode: <pattern>` would match the runtime code. The pattern could be some limited form of regular expressions.

I'm not sure if this is worth it. How many of these do we have?

I think it would not be a big deal, but would allow us to remove these random weird tests we have scattered around, like doing something like this in the CLI tests. The CLI tests should be only about the CLI and not a bunch of other random things.

If it would also lead to more tests being extracted, I think it's a good idea.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

We might want to keep it open. We even had a PR for it (#11424). We closed it because it got stale but we could at least keep the issue to go back to it eventually.

We can also keep it closed and if anyone actually needs this reconsider it :-).
