# [\#10822 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10822) `merged`: Windows compatibility fixes for bytecode report

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-01-19 17:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10822):

- Both `isolate_tests.py` and `prepare_report.py` were using Python's universal newline mode when reading/writing files (by using the default `newline=None` with [open()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)). This resulted in files stored on disk having `\n` newlines on Unix and `\r\n` on Windows. It didn't matter with Standard JSON because the universal newline mode converts them all to `\n` when reading the file and inserting it into JSON but with the new upcoming CLI mode (#10676) the file is read from disk and bytecode ends up different on Windows.
- My updated `prepare_report.py` from #10675 would print Windows-style paths on Windows. This only affected unit tests since in practice we only pass file names without path to the report.
- Turns out that docstrings get different line endings on different platforms. I was using them in unit tests added in #10675. This PR converts them all to normal strings with explicit `\n` endings.
- Git in CircleCI is configured with `core.autocrlf = true` on Windows machines which means that the checked out files are not exactly identical to the ones in the repo. I modified Windows jobs to disable the conversion.

Note that don't have a CI job for running Python unit tests yet. I'm adding one in #10819 and basing it on top of this PR so you can see there if they're passing.

Bytecode comparison fails so it looks like I'm not done with this PR yet.

Turns out that @chriseth was right, git does automatic line ending conversion on Windows in CircleCI. I researched that some time ago and figured out it does not because the official docs do not specify the default and found info in other sources that it's `false`. Turns out that it is but the installer on Windows asks the user about it (so it depends) and CircleCI and Github decided to enable it too (see [CircleCI config teardown: How we write our CircleCI config at CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/circleci-config-teardown-how-we-write-our-circleci-config-at-circleci/) and https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/135#issuecomment-613329879).

I checked via SSH and indeed it's the input file checked out from the repo contains `\r\n` endings and it's not Python's `open()` changing them.

So I think this time I got all of it and bytecode comparison should now be passing but we'll see...

Done. The only conflict was in `check_style.sh`, due to changed indentation of the list of files exempt from trailing whitespace check.
