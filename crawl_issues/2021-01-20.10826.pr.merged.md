Kudos for finding this that fast by the way - doesn't look particularly easy to spot!

Thanks :) I stumbled over that particular piece of code a few weeks earlier. At the time I thought I am just missing something in how the whole thing works. Turns out, I wasn't.

JFYI: Prior to this fix, the following code when compiled and deployed on Remix and on invoking `g()`, execution throws because of `INVALID` op code being executed.

```
function f() {
  if (true) {}
  bytes storage b;
  b[0] = 0x42;
}

contract C {
  function g() external { f(); }
}
```

Edit: I suppose buggy contracts using such code may have caught the error during tests.
