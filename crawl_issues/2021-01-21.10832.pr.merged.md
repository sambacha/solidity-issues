# [\#10832 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10832) `merged`: More robust interactive mode in command-line tests

Depends on #10814.

Adds two more improvements:
- You can now skip the test or launch an editor to edit the expectation file, just like with isoltest.
- Mismatched exit code no longer unconditionally ends the script.
    - You can now choose to change the expectation or skip it, just like in other cases.
    - Without this change the autoupdate feature was not fully automatic because it stopped on invalid exit codes.
    - I think that the original intention for the unconditional exit might have been that in most cases we're testing the positive case and non-zero exit code indicates some serious problem. I usually test error conditions though and not being able to update the expectation is annoying.
