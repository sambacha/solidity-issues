# [\#10833 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10833) `merged`: Extend the Solidity AST for precise locations of names

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2021-01-21 15:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10833):

This is an extracted commit of PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8125

The actual SourceLocation on an ASTNode is representing the whole
ASTNode whereas in an LSP context (for example) you are also interested in the
SourceLocation of a name of that construct (for example variable declaration, function definition, ...).

This PR is a split-out of the LSP PR that only covers modifying the AST.

With regards to tests: I think this would be implicitly tests within the `solls` (LSP server) test cases that will expect the correct source locations for symbols in tests for e.g. "find all references", "semantic highlighting", "go to definition".

Shouldn't we export (and re-import) this in the JSON-AST? I would expect many people to be happy to have the name location.

absolutely. I'll be adding that tomorrow morning (late read, sorry).

Please add a changelog entry.

I just realize we have quite a few (not to say many) places where we pair a name with a location while parsing. I wonder why this one isn't then an `Identifier` AST node, I'd love that to happen, also as it's easier to traverse through the information then (at least it looks more in line with the rest). I think I could make that as part of a split-PR (not in here, to get that one merged).

Test failures.

I hope that soltest will fail. If it does not, our test setup is broken.

Phew. Everything failed as expected. Will update expectations.

Didn't this introduce a backwards-incompatible change and thus needs a major version change?

AFAIR it only adds (nameLocation) to the C++ AST but doesn't change nor remove. So this is backwards incompatible.
