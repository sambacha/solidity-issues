# [\#10835 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10835) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Basic support for inline assembly that over-approximates its effects.

This PR adds basic support in SMTChecker for the analysis of Inline Assembly blocks.
The basic approach over-approximates the effects of the assembly in the following way:

- If any Solidity-level local variable is assigned in the assembly, it is considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.
- If the block modifies storage (e.g., using `sstore`), all storage variables are considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.
- If the block modifies memory (e.g., using `mstore`), all memory variables are considered as having an unknown value at the end of the assembly block.
- In all other cases, the variables keep their value from just before the assembly block.

This over-approximation at least eliminates false negatives, as were seen in #10619.
It is a first step towards #10596.

@leonardoalt , check if you agree with the error message, or I should revert it back to the original one. As I mentioned, since the inline assembly causes potentially quite a big over-approximations, I would keep displaying the warning.

Addressed the comments and rebased.
I am not sure of this should have a changelog entry or not.
It does eliminate some false negatives, but it is still a very over-approximative analysis.

I think it should have a Changelog entry at least as a bugfix because it fixes the false negatives

Some weird exceptions in Yul tests

I don't understand these failings, and they happen in completely unrelated tests.

Added a changelog entry and rebased.
