The added tests used to throw because the wrong scope contract was taken into account,

So was this broken for inheritance in general? From your comments in the code I understand that the bug should affect code with virtual function calls but the tests cases don't have any virtuals and both the assertion and the variable are in the same contract.

Not in general. It used to break when:
- the failed target is in a base contract
- the derived contract has extra state variables

Found a bug when writing more tests so blocking for now

Nothing, I just brought it back from draft after the bugfix PR that blocked this was merged.
