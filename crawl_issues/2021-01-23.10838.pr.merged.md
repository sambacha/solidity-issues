# [\#10838 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10838) `merged`: Bytecode comparison PR scripts for solc-bin

~Depends on #10680.~ It's on `develop` now.

The scripts added here contain the main logic of the bytecode comparison PR check in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/77. The scripts assume the availability of extra features added to `prepare_report.py` and `prepare_report.js` in #10680, #10679 and #10676.

The code was originally directly in the Github action but it grew enough to warrant putting it in standalone scripts. The PR creates`scripts/solc-bin/` directory in solidity repo and I think we should start putting scripts used by solc-bin there. The downside of such a policy is that every time you want to run a script in solc-bin CI, you need to clone the solidity repo, which is sometimes an unnecessary overhead. In this case, however, the PR check needs a clone anyway for other purposes and the upside is that we avoid duplicating the CI infrastructure around scripts, e.g. shellcheck.

#10680 has been merged so this is now ready for review.

Yeah, https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/76 was actually a huge stress test for it. The PR sits on top of the bytecode compare PR check (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/77) so these scripts were executed for all macOS binaries between 0.4.0 and 0.6.0. I also ran it on the whole 0.3.6-0.8.0 range separately just to be sure it works for all the old versions.

You can take a look at https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/76/checks?check_run_id=1761261024 to see how it behaves in practice.
