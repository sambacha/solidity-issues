Once the images are built, their hashes will be used by the PR that updates the tests.

@cameel nop, arch installs directly from `pacman` which has 4.8.10, it fails because the tests weren't updated.
Actually I think I ran this too quickly... the ppa builds must be finished to have an effect on the ubuntu builds, they should fail with the old tests and new z3.

Ah no, the images are fine. I need to copy the hashes in the comments here into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10845, and the tests should pass there. Only after merging that we should merge this one.

I'm slightly worried that the docker images are being built again, this shouldn't be the case... if it is, the hashes are gonna be different and we'll have to do the other PR again

Ah, right. That's because you rebased it. They will almost certainly be different unless it's using Docker's cache (and I don't think it is because the build machine is not persistent).

I remember that last time @aarlt was updating the images, he put the PR using the hashes on top of the one building the images. Looks like that was a better strategy.

Anyway, the images that were already built should be good so I think all tests will pass anyway, even if you do not take the new hashes.

Yea, I cancelled the new builds so we don't have trash lying around, but should be good
