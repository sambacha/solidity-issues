In solc-bin we have [soljson-v0.3.6+commit.3fc68da5.js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/soljson-v0.3.6+commit.3fc68da5.js) and [soljson-v0.3.6+commit.3fc68da5.js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/wasm/soljson-v0.3.6+commit.3fc68da5.js), both built from 3fc68da5. Tag [`v0.3.6`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/v0.3.6) points at commit 988fe5e (i.e. one commit after 3fc68da5).

This is a problem because they will produce different bytecode than releases from other platforms built on `v0.3.6` (e.g. the recent macOS rebuilds).

The binaries in solc-bin are not necessarily the files that were released - [release `v0.3.6`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.3.6) has no binaries attached at all - so I think we could rebuild on the tag and put both in the repo.

@chriseth I have manually compared the Linux and wasm reports for 0.3.6 and bytecode differs only in a handful of cases. All of these contain libraries and the only difference is this small fragment:

```patch
< 03063fc68da5
---
> 0306cbf55226
```

I investigated this and turns out it's the version stamp for libraries added by [`injectVersionStampIntoSub()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.3.6/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerContext.cpp#L175-L180):
```c++
void CompilerContext::injectVersionStampIntoSub(size_t _subIndex)
{
	eth::Assembly& sub = m_asm.sub(_subIndex);
	sub.injectStart(Instruction::POP);
	sub.injectStart(fromBigEndian<u256>(binaryVersion()));
}
```

Note that the stamp in each case consists of `03` `06` (corresponding to 0.3.6) followed by the first 8 digits of the commit hash.

Surprisingly, `cbf55226` is not a valid commit and definitely not the commit `v0.3.6` points at (988fe5e). It's probably the commit ID that was created after the script cherry-picked necessary fixes. It should not happen though because I did set `commit_hash.txt` to get the same commit ID as in the emscripten case. This method worked for >= 0.4.0 (bytecode reports match emscripten) so I wonder if 0.3.6 maybe just did not not support `commit_hash.txt`? I need to check that.

Another unexpected thing is that I did not see for >= 0.4.0 is that there are a few files for which one of the binaries errored out and the other did not.

### Full bytecode diff
Here are the whole reports if you want to take a look:
- [report-solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.3.6+commit.3fc68da5.js.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/5867576/report-solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.3.6%2Bcommit.3fc68da5.js.txt)
- [report-solc-macosx-amd64-v0.3.6+commit.988fe5e5.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/5867577/report-solc-macosx-amd64-v0.3.6%2Bcommit.988fe5e5.txt)

For convenience, here's one of the test cases that have this difference in the bytecode:

I think it would be useful documenting all these in a section in the documentation (instead of issues). By "documenting all these" I mean what people should expect from which distributed version. It may be a better option than trying to resolve problems for ancient releases. Of course documenting it would not be possible without the meticulous investigative work you have done with these.

Yeah, documenting them sounds like a good idea. But I think we still should fix at least those problems that are easy to fix (like for example renaming the Linux 0.4.10) :)

Do you think it should be documented in the main docs or is the `solc-bin` README (or separate READMEs in the directories containing the binaries) a better place?

Absolutely, where it is easy to fix, go ahead. But probably it is not worth spending days/weeks on these :)

I think the main documentation is better, nobody reads those readmes too much.

OK. So I'll add a section the docs on that.
