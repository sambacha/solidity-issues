# [\#10850 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10850) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix buggy virtual and super

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-01-26 21:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10850):

Virtual and super resolution were not taking the correct contracts into account.
To support that properly in CHC we need a full CFG encoding of every function of every base contract to also be part of the most derived contract. Now, `SMTEncoder::contractFunctions` (1) returns the functions of a contract including inherited functions, after override resolution, and `SMTEncoder::contractFunctionsWithoutVirtual` (2) returns ALL the functions of ALL base contracts. Only functions in (1) can be an entry point for the most derived contract.

@leonardoalt , Can you add the following test?
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract A {
    int public x;
	function f() public virtual {
		x = 1;
	}
}

contract B is A {
    function f() public virtual override {
        super.f();
        x += 100;
	}
}

contract C is B {
	function f() public virtual override {
		super.f();
        	x += 10;
	}
}

contract D is B {
}

contract E is C,D {
	function f() public override(C,B) {
		super.f();
		assert(x == 111); // should hold
		assert(x == 13); // should fail
	}
}
```

This test is **crashing** in 0.8.1 (and develop), but works fine with this PR.
