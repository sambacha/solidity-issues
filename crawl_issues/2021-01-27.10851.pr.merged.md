# [\#10851 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10851) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Add missing type constraints for Address

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-01-27 07:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10851):

This PR adds the missing type constraints on symbolic type `Address`.
The missing constraints allowed solver to assign values, e.g., to `msg.sender`  that were out of expected range.
The added test `msg_sender_range.sol` checks that the solver now considers only valid range.

The rest of the changed tests are just changed counter-examples where the solver found a different model.
