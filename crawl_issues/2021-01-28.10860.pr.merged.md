This is much much better now, you addressed pretty much all of the concerns I had in the issue / confusing bits. This is much easier to follow, especially the part about `p`. Thanks

I'm still not sure /  a bit confused around "adding an offset" for non value types. Maybe the example should add nested structs as well, e.g. `foo[4].bar[3].baz`

for a sample contract like so

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract C {
  struct Disco { 
          uint a; 
          uint b; 
          mapping(uint => Techno) bar;
  }
  struct Techno {
         uint g;
         uint baz; 
 }
  uint x;
  mapping(uint => Disco) foo;
}

```

am I right in my understanding that the location for `foo[4].bar[3].baz` should be (for all integer numbers below assume uint256(integer) so 31 bytes of leading zeros, `.` is concatenation `+` is arithmetic addition)

`keccak ( 0x03 . ( keccak( 0x04 . 0x01 ) + 0x02) ) ) + 0x01`

@relyt29 yes, your computation is correct.
