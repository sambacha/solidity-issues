# [\#10862 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10862) `merged`: Fix check_style.sh refactor

Fixes bugs introduced in #10797. Looks like I did not test it thoroughly enough.

~Note: It's still a draft because I included a commit with intentional style error to make sure the script works this time. I'll remove it and mark as ready to review once I see that comments are getting posted correctly.~ It's ready now.

It's now ready for review and the `chk_coding_style` job is passing but let's make sure all jobs pass before merging just in case.
