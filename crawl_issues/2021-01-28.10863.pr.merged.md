@cameel Updated
Gas tests will be run only when expectation is present.
I removed gas expectations from all the tests that have less than 100K gas usage (still 600+ tests are affected)
Also, updated to use only latest version of evm for gas usage

Maybe it would be interesting to add test cases that are doing gas measurements for all the different evm versions. E.g. setting the same tests that only differ in the defined `EVMVersion`. With this we could more easily detect if e.g. a new future was accidentally changing the gas-costs of older evm versions. But I'm not sure whether it would really make sense. I just imagine, if someone adds a feature for the latest evm version, that should only influence the gas cost in that particular version, but it also change the gas cost of other version(s), that this could be interesting to see.

@aarlt Regarding what gas costs are added to expectations by enforce feature, I did it in a way that I add only gas costs greater than X(which was set to 100000 gas). So if, for example ir* is missing, it means that it has gas cost of less than 100k gas...

I just checked out your branch and ran the tests locally. It looks like that I have always different gas measurement results.

If i run `test/tools/isoltest -t semanticTests/\* --vm /Users/alex/evmone/lib/libevmone.dylib  --no-smt` I got this:

@mijovic not sure whether it's confusing. If the values less than `100000` changes very often, it may be too annoying to always update the tests. But I guess they would not change that much, right? I think that it would be nice to see always any gas change, so that the implementor/s and reviewer/s will get more conscious what a change meant to the gas costs.

It's using `berlin` EVM by default. I'm not sure if that's the default value for `--evm-version` as well. If it's not then that might explain the difference. Can you try to run with `--evm-version berlin`?

That sounds like a good idea if it's not too much effort. I can see how in some cases these gas measurements could be annoying.

Looking closer at your results, the numbers are actually the same, only the order diffrers.

Maybe the code that prints the `gas` expectations is not enforcing any particular order and it's non-deterministic? If so, we should sort them.

maybe the latest version should be default, if version was not specified.

Good catch! So berlin is default already? strange that by specifying the version it was in the correct order

@aarlt Looks like it's not hard-coded to any specific version and uses the latest one instead: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.1/test/Common.cpp#L182-L193

So, false alarm, fortunately. The problem is probably just that the order is non-deterministic. Maybe it actually by some weird accident somehow depends on the evm version object? :)

I think that it would be nice to see always any gas change, so that the implementor/s and reviewer/s will get more conscious what a change meant to the gas costs.

My idea for this `100000` limit was a mechanism to initially activate some tests. Also, if you add particular query to the test it will be measured in any case. So, this enforce gas test was developed for the purpose of activating gas costs.
I would say that we should have option for the test to measure only some gas costs (without need of adding all 4 measures).

If we don't specify version it runs `istanbul` as that is default one in EVMVersion:
`Version m_version = Version::Istanbul;`

Order of elements was not deterministic, but anyway it shouldn't produce failure as order is not important. Now I will make it deterministic anyway.

Making the order deterministic is a good thing. Less noise in diffs. But if it's not that then there must be a difference. I just looked at it more closely and there is one tiny difference after all: @aarlt got `gas Legacy` of 151224 for constructor while the expectation is 152088.

> If we don't specify version it runs `istanbul` as that is default one in EVMVersion:

Interesting. I missed that detail. I thought that `EVMVersion{}` was defaulting to the latest version. But it makes sense - `berlin` has not been released yet. So this probably explains the difference for @aarlt.

This shows that `isoltest` really should refuse to work and report an error when you use a different EVM. Or at least print a warning when updating expectations.

Also, we should probably use the same value for both? I.e. either run tests by default on latest EVM and use gas costs for do both for current EVM for both?

I asked about this on gitter and it turns out that we don't have anything implemented for `berlin` and [evmone even uses the same exact set of instructions for `berlin` and `istanbul`](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/blob/v0.5.0/lib/evmone/instructions.cpp#L1415). So the difference @aarlt reported must have been caused by something else.

And the default should stay at `istanbul`.

The thing was that there was no difference, but a problem in the order. Somehow the expectations where "shuffled", but the values where the same. Not sure what made the difference in the ordering.

@aarlt Was there really no difference? `gas Legacy` does differ in the output you posted earlier (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10863#issuecomment-769964836). I said it's just the order but I was wrong, I didn't look at it carefully enough.

Also, I changed to run gas tests only if `--enforce-gas-cost` is passed to `soltest`, and by default in `isoltest` it runs them.
Because of that, I added a CI jobs for optimized and unoptimized gas cost checks.
Then I changed occurrences of `if (m_evmVersion== EVMVersion{}` to `if (m_enforceGasCost)`

Also, did change a bit debug print by using signed operations, so no need to complicate with `increase` flag.
