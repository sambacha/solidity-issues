references https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7877

Todo:
 - [x] code generation
 - [x] export all errors in the ABI
 - [x] test semantics (also via import!)
 - [ ] documentation
 - [x] check that natspec is associated to the error and exported to the ABI
 
Test ideas:
 - [x] error signature clash
 -  [ ] import error using alias and see if the error signature is still correct
 - [x] semantic test for error with signature `0`

I'll split this up into multiple pull requests, it is too much in one go.

Closing this, I don't think there is much left here that has not been extracted into other PRs.
