@cameel this was the dumb way I mentioned. Based on discussions this week on the channel, we can do a much better option.

OK, so what was the alternative? This doesn't look that bad (except that it duplicates some code from `assembleAndGuessRuntime()`).

Rebased this, just for the sake of it.

Looked into `assembleWithDeployed` and the logic it has would need to be duplicated here, or we would need to extend `MachineAssemblyObject` with `std::option<evmasm::Assembly` or `std::any`, because the whole point of this PR is to expose the underlying `evmasm::Assembly` object.

We could take a more complicated route, where we introduce the individual additional features `evmasm::Assembly` has to `MachineAssemblyObject`.

Here are multiple options:
1. Have` compileEVM()` from the second commit, and just do the `assembly->sub()` lookup in CompilerStack.
2. Have the current version (all the changes).
3. Have something else.

If we go with the current version, we should also change `StandardCompiler::compileYul` so we can remove the code duplication I made in AssemblyStack.

Current approach looks good.

About the "runtime name" - in the future, we should determine this automatically from annotations in the yul code.

@chriseth So you want this `CompilerStack::assemble()` refactoring? I'll squash it then and do the ident thing.

Yes, please squash.

@chriseth done!

Added assert, renamed and adjusted the indentation.
