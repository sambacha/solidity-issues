# [\#10867 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10867) `merged`: [isoltest] Add support for builtin functions.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5008794?u=aa5f725afdad81154a79cd5ab6be9340b08da4a9&v=4" width="50">[aarlt](https://github.com/aarlt) opened issue at [2021-01-29 21:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10867):

I extracted the builtin part from #10728. I think it is easier to review it as a separated PR. Probably we get this merged before #10728 is done.

Main motivation for this was to have an easy way to plugin new commands into isoltest, without touching the parser. This should simplify the extension of new expectation commands.

- [X] No need to specify function signature for builtin calls.
- [X] Simplified failure creation for builtins.
- [X] User defined expectation update mechanism.
  - [X] Initial working version.
  - [X] Remove Logging specific stuff.

After discussion with @christeth I removed the support to have builtin functions on the expectation side.
```
// functionCallSide -> expectationSide
```

@mijovic Not sure whether it would make sense also for #10863 to use this mechanism. Would you say it may simplify #10863?

```
// ----
// test_bytes() ->
// gas ir: 516922
// gas legacy: 466763
// gas legacyOptimized: 374537
// gas irOptimized: 516922
```
using builtins it could become:
```
// ----
// test_bytes() ->
// gas.ir() -> 516922
// gas.legacy() -> 466763
// gas.legacyOptimized() -> 374537
// gas.irOptimized() -> 516922
```

I am fine with any notation. Maybe using your suggestion it would be better in sense that we have the same notation.

I guess, not yet. But I think it will reviewable in the next days.

@mijovic I just finished an initial version of the generic expectation update mechanism. I think it would make sense if we look into this together, because you also needed to implement expectation updates in the context of #10863. Right now I introduced a `Behaviour` class (maybe we need a better name) that can be used to define more complex expectation updates. I named it `Behaviour` because it can be used to check whether the test-cases follow a specific behaviour, e.g. "where all produced events  consumed by subsequent calls?". I will take a look how you are doing the gas measurements and how you are updating your expectations soon, hopefully before our meeting on Monday. If you find some time it would be great if you could take look at this PR, maybe you see already obvious problems, or maybe I missed something.

@aarlt
I like idea behind `Behaviour`class. Also, it might be better to name it `TestExpectation` as it will map better to what it represents actually, or maybe some third name. Based on what state `isoltest` is in, it can give a flag or something similar to that to the "behavior" so it can decide what to print to stream based on if it failed or not. For example, if gas tests are failing, and function returns expected results, I would expect that `isoltest` updates only gas expectations, not the actual return values.
Anyway, something like this should be definitely added to isoltest, as we will add more and more tests to it, and having a generic way to add different functionality is great.

I didn't do review comments, as I'll wait for you to extract parts for events to its own PR.

Does it make sense to make `Behaviour` to be abstract class with all the functions without implementation?

also, is PR ready for review now, or you are still adding changes?

> Does it make sense to make `Behaviour` to be abstract class with all the functions without implementation?

Not sure, I was also thinking about this. But somehow I thought that it is maybe better to leave it like this, because new behaviours only need to specify the functions that are needed, not all.

> also, is PR ready for review now, or you are still adding changes?

I think it is ready. At least it cannot hurt if you could already look into it :)

@chriseth maybe you have an idea how to name the `Behaviour` class? @mijovic was suggesting `TestExpectation`, what would you say?

What about something like `TestHook`?

@mijovic I think https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10867#issuecomment-770689560 sounds good!

Actually it would rather be
```
// ----
// test_bytes ->
// gas.ir -> 516922
// gas.legacy -> 466763
// gas.legacyOptimized -> 374537
// gas.irOptimized -> 516922
```
Which I think looks even better.

Looks better than what it is right now definitely. I will rebase my PR on top of this one. Or maybe better open a new one and close the old one

I think it's not really needed to define an awesome `SmokeHook` example here. I thought it could make sense to show how these hooks work, but I think it is not really needed, because we will have some real hooks (gas expectation & isoltest events) soon. I think it's ok to just define an empty `SmokeHook` in this PR.

As discussed with @chriseth, we decided to split this PR into a pure builtin PR and a test-hook PR. This PR will only consists of the builtin feature.

@chriseth I removed now the support that allowed builtins on the expectation side.

This looks almost ready to be merged now :)
Can you rebase the storageEmpty on top of it?
