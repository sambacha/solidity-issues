The TypeChecker shuold result in an error here and thus the PostTypeChecker should not run.

Sure, I'll take it.

Though, I am not sure it should already error in the TypeChecker.. the PostTypeChecker is doing the type checker here and it just seems to assume too much about the type.. or do you think we should have an extra visitor for `OverrideSpecifiers` in TypeChecker? Do we have all the type information at that point already?

The problem is that the post type checker is run at all even though there was a problem during type checking.
