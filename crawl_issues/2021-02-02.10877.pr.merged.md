# [\#10877 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10877) `merged`: Use Bash arrays for argument lists in shell scripts

Depends on #10585.

This PR fixes shellcheck warnings about missing quotes in cases where they can contain spaces and are unquoted on purpose (to rely on Bash word splitting behavior). The solution is to use Bash arrays.

I think I can mark this as ready for review without extra manual testing because all the modified scripts in this PR do run in CI.
