# [\#10879 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10879) `merged`: Silence remaining shellcheck warnings and remove ignore list

~Depends on #10586. It will remain a draft until all PRs below are merged.~ It's on `develop` now.

This is the last batch and mostly just disables warnings where shellcheck is overzealous or doing it properly is not worth the extra effort.

It also removes the whole ignorelist mechanism from our scripts. I think that going forward it's better to add specific local ignores in scripts instead of having the whole script ignored.

I have just merged #10586 so I'm marking this as ready for review.

Rebased on `develop` just to make sure that there are no warnings reappearing due to some recent changes.
