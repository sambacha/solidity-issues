First commit is the fix.

The second commit is a change to make the 3rd argument non-default, so you cannot accidentally miss specifying it on non-native members.

Is there a bug this could cause? Is there a test which could be added?

Actually, I have missed this. I wonder if it is plausible to test this (did we test all other cases then too?). I have to see if i can create some code that triggers it, however, I found it during LSP development; goto-definition or find-all-references had issues, so I was tracing it down to that point.

I'd like to have some isoltest-style tests for the LSP mode of solc though. What do you think?

Sounds nice, but I think this should be tested outside of it. I'm not fully sure why this could not manifest in any actual issue, but at least the JSON AST should be affected. If nothing is affected, then why have the declaration there at all? :)

Indeed, please add a json-ast test.

Rebased.
