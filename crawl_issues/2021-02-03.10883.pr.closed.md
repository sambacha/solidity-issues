# [\#10883 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10883) `closed`: Catch custom errors

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-02-03 10:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10883):

Catching part of custom errors. Currently delayed until after creating errors is finished.

Test ideas:
-  [ ] catch error using alias and see if it works
 - [ ] semantic test for catching error with signature `0`
 - [ ] various decoding errors (that should all end up in the fallback)
 - [ ] `catch Error.Something()`
