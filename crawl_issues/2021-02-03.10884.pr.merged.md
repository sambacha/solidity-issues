# [\#10884 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10884) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Small refactoring

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-02-03 11:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10884):

This PR introduces 2 small refactoring changes:

- `CHC::state` that provides the shortcut to `m_context.state()`is lifted to the base class and is used wherever possible.
- `resetStorageVariables` can achieve the proper effect instead of combining `resetStateVariables` and `resetStorageReferences`

@leonardoalt , can you have a look at this? It should be easier to review the commits separately.

Also, the CI is reporting some weird errors, like error downloading range-v3?!
