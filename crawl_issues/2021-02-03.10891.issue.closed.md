I don't know why we allow the above code to be compiled in the old codegen. I think we should only allow the usage of `this.g.selector`.

@ekpyron Just saw that this was allowed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8137/files#diff-5cc133bfc337e9ca7fe7ee9842d5ddfa492fa559149cf8acec4a7d9ede50c9aaR2980

Is there a reason why we allow `g.selector` despite being an internal function call?

@hrkrshnn It's even worse. Rules are different for `.address` and `.selector` and there are more factors that affect what is allowed and what is not. The rules seem pretty random to me. I think this is a separate issue so reported as #10905 (see the example I included there). For the ICE here I think it's best to assume that if it passes on the old codegen, it should work with IR too.

As mentioned in the issue: it does make sense that the rules for ``.address`` and ``.selector`` are different...
We could of course disallow ``.selector`` for functions unless they are explicitly referred to in external calling context. But why would we?

So as to:

I would ask the contrary: is there any particular reason for *not* allowing it :-)? Those are functions that *can* be used externally, so all of them do have selectors. I'd be fine with disallowing to query them unless explicitly used in external calling context, but I also don't see a really good reason why one necessarily should.

I mean you say ``g`` being an internal function, whereas ``this.g`` is an external function... if you look at it that way, probably only the latter should get ``.selector``.
But you can also look at ``g`` being a *public* function (that's how it's declared) - so it generally has a ``.selector`` member. Just ``g(...)`` vs ``this.g(...)`` are ways to *call* this one *public* function internally or externally...

On the other hand we also only allow ``function() external x = this.g;`` not ``function() external x = g;``...

But yeah: the reason for allowing it was that we do have the information to produce a selector on ``g``, so we *can* allow it :-). But as I said, I'd also be fine with disallowing it - note that that's a breaking change, though, strictly speaking.

So maybe best just to implement it for sol->yul for now and we can keep an issue about disallowing it, if we want to do that.

My main issue is that

``` 
  contract C {
	  function f() public {
	  }
	  function g() public {
		  f.selector;
	  }
  }
```
produces
```
 Error: Member "selector" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().
 --> <stdin>:5:3:
  |
5 | 		f.selector;
  | 		^^^^^^^^^^
```

whereas

```
  contract D {
	  function f() public {
	  }
  }
  contract C is D {
	  function g() public {
		  f.selector;
	  }
  }
```
compiles fine.

If we are allowing `f.selector`, just because we can compute the selector, then I think both cases should be allowed.

Both cases should be disallowed, internal functions do not have selectors. So to me, this is an issue with inheritance and we should check if there is any deeper problem.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2021-02-08 12:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10891#issuecomment-775101149):

In the end I think the reason this is allowed is since we wanted to be able to globally access the selector via the contract name, i.e.
```
contract B {
  function f() external {}
  function g() public {}
}
contract C {
  function h() public {
     B.f.selector;
     B.g.selector;
  }
}
```

Even or especially if ``C`` does *not* inherit from ``B``.
But then it would be weird, if changing this to having ``C`` inherit from ``B`` were to change this, so we wanted to allow it for that case, too. But, unfortunately, in that case ``B.g`` internally has the same type as ``g``, so it so happens that allowing ``B.g.selector`` meant to also allow ``g.selector``.

The alternative was basically https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8137/files#r367386872, i.e. to introduce one or even two more function type kinds to distinguish these... or we'd need to typecheck our way out of it, disallowing the ``g.selector`` on pain of it not being a member access via contract name...

In any case I'd still say this should be implemented in Sol->Yul (it's not like that would be hard to do) - and then we can decide whether we want to introduce more complexity to disallow the rather weird artifact cases.

Note that
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract B {
  function f() external {}
  function g() public {}
}

contract C is B {
    function h() public {
        B.f.selector; B.g.selector;
    }
}
```
also throws in Sol->Yul for the same reason, while removing ``is B`` does not. And at least this should work, independently of what we should do about ``g.selector``.
