I fixed this differently when discussed. I use now the `TypeChecker` to retrieve the needed array type information and store the result in a `FunctionCallAnnotation`. Is it ok to use the `TypeChecker` to do this?

 I also tried to add this information directly to the `FunctionType`, but I was not able to do this, somehow I was only able to retrieve `const FunctionType`'s. So I could not add the information there. But probably I missed something.

I don't think this is the solution. Does it work on the following:
```
contract C {
  uint[] x;
  function f() internal returns (uint[] storage) { return x; }
  function g() internal {
    f().pop();
  }
}
```

Ah, I think it does - what about the following:
```
contract C {
  uint[] x;
  function g() internal {
    (([x])[0]).pop();
  }
}
```

I think you can create the function type using
```
	FunctionType(
		TypePointers{arrayType},
		TypePointers{},
		strings(),
		strings(),
		FunctionType::Kind::ArrayPop,
		false,
		StateMutability::NonPayable,
		nullptr,
		false,
		false,
		false,
		true
	):
```

Ah, more easily:
```
	FunctionType(
		TypePointers{arrayType},
		TypePointers{},
		strings(),
		strings(),
		FunctionType::Kind::ArrayPop,
	).asBoundFunction();
```

I rewrote now the PR so that it uses `FunctionType`. But somehow there seem to be some additional behaviour involved, especially with regards to yul. So the yul related tests will fail for now.

@chriseth I'm not sure whether the usage of `FunctionType` to solve this is a good solution. The usage seem to implicate some additional behaviour within the type-checker & codegen. That means, if we use `FunctionType` we need to have special cases in the behaviour, if we see a function type kind of `FunctionType::Kind::ArrayPop`. 

If the `FunctionType` is setup so that the array-type is saved in the return-type - we got a problem with the stack-height. If we use the parameter-type we will need to change the type-checker to ignore the checks that detect that  there was no parameter provided for `pop()`. Also the yul generator seem to generate code where pop will have one additional parameter needed (this is right now the reason for the failing tests).

@chriseth did you meant the usage of `FunctionType` like this?

Did you try returning a bound function type inside `ArrayType::nativeMembers`?
