For the solc fuzzer to query storage state such that program (p, s) and optimised program (p", s) both have identical storage state post execution. Does that make sense?

@ekpyron Actually this PR is rebased on top of #10878 that incorporates almost all reviewer comments there. Could you ack on that PR if it is merge worthy? Once that PR is merged, this PR becomes much smaller.
