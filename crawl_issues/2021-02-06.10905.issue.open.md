## Description
Rules for deciding whether the code using `.address` or `.selector` on public functions is valid or not seem pretty random. It sometimes works without `this` and sometimes doesn't. Behavior is different between for `.selector` and for `.address`. It also changes depending on whether the value is actually used or not.

## Example
```solidity
contract B {
    function g() public {}
}

contract C is B {
    function h() public  {
        address a1 = g.address;     // Error: Member "address" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().
        address a2 = this.g.address;
        address a3 = h.address;     // Error: Member "address" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().
        address a4 = this.h.address;

        g.address;                  // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'
        this.g.address;             // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'
        h.address;                  // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'
        this.h.address;             // Error: Expected identifier but got 'address'

        bytes4 s1 = g.selector;
        bytes4 s2 = this.g.selector;
        bytes4 s3 = h.selector;     // Error: Member "selector" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().
        bytes4 s4 = this.h.selector;

        g.selector;
        this.g.selector;
        h.selector;                 // Error: Member "selector" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in function ().
        this.h.selector;
    }
}
```

The `Expected identifier` errors are from the parser - I guess it has a missing "use keyword for identifier" workaround, which maybe is also just fine.

It's not exactly random - ``address`` and ``selector`` are allowed, whenever the function is referred to as external function, i.e. using ``this.``. The expression-statement version of those could arguably be changed, but then again those don't have an effect anyways, so maybe it's fine, yeah.

Ah, no, now I see what you mean... yeah maybe we should disallow ``selector`` on functions used in internal context...

However, ``selector`` just depends on the arguments and can be used without there actually being an actual external function pointer, so we can fetch a selector as long as it's a function that *might* be used externally. On the other hand we only have an address, if we actually have it. So also the difference between the two does make sense...

Well, I know that it's not really random but there are at least 2 or 3 things (either bugs or design decisions) that make the rules complex so it may just as well be random from user's perspective :)

At least the usage with `this` is consistently allowed if we ignore the `Expected identifier` case.

> The `Expected identifier` errors are from the parser - I guess it has a missing "use keyword for identifier" workaround, which maybe is also just fine.

Unless it happens in other expressions where it would not be a no-op. The fact that `this.g.address;` on its own is illegal was certainly baffling when I ran into it while trying things out.

> However, selector just depends on the arguments and can be used without there actually being an actual external function pointer, so we can fetch a selector as long as it's a function that might be used externally.

I think it's fine to be able to use it on internal stuff that can be called externally but it's inconsistent that it works for `g` and not for `h` while both `this.g` and `this.h` work. Also, the error message does not explain why `selector` is missing which adds to the confusion.

A bit weird to now double-discuss this with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10891 :-). Short version of what I said there: the fact that ``g.selector`` is valid is a side-effect of ``B.g.selector`` being valid and us assigning both of them the same type internally. The latter works and should work (that was an explicit feature request), even if used from a contract that does not inherit from ``B``. So yeah, it might be nice to disallow ``g.selector`` there, but it'll probably involve some tinkering, since there are cases that currently have the same types that should be allowed.

Any why not just allow `h.selector` instead? As a bonus, it would not even be a breaking change.

If we allow `h.selector`, we have to check whether the function's parameters are valid outside of the contract which turns this into an even more complicated rule.

Hm, maybe :-). My guess without looking into it would be that internally the compiler treats ``h`` just as having ``FunctionType::Kind::Internal``, i.e. you no longer know from its type alone that it's actually ``public``... and we can't just allow it for all internal functions, since they may use internal types, s.t. there is no selector... but yeah - both disallowing ``g.selector`` and allowing ``h.selector`` sounds good to me, but both may require some reworking of the internals...

As long as ``h`` is public, it should be fine, shouldn't it? That would be a consistent rule - as long as we refer to a public function, we can fetch a selector... but still probably messy internally, since ``h`` gets an internal function type kind... so the general problem is that we collapse too many function types in the AST/compiler type system - maybe we should have spent more time on that in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8137, but we settled for a "close enough" back then...

I think these are two unrelated issues:
 - `this.g.address;` should parse. In general, `.address` should be valid everywhere in the parser.
 -  `g.selector;` should not work.

Acutally there are quite complicated rules about `.selector` and maybe it's best to just leave them as they are...
