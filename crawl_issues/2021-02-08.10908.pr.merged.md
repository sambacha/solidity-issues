# [\#10908 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10908) `merged`: Fix shadowing struct types by struct member names

Fixes #9231.

This sounds like it is fixing a special case and a more general solution is possible. The issue at hand is that we do register a name that could shadow, but there is no code from which it could be accessed by that name. The same is true for a different but similar situation:
```
abstract contract C {
  function f(uint C) public pure;
}
```
as opposed to
```
contract C {
  function f(uint C) public pure {};
}
```
The second should create an error, the first does not have to. The same is true for event parameter names.

Are these two situations similar or not?

Currently both samples produce the same warning:

Do you mean something like this:
```
contract C {
  event e(uint C);
}
```
It compiles without the shadowing warning or error (which is fine I guess).

I'm having a closer look to see if we can have some unification.

@chriseth
We can just handle parameters of abstract functions the same way as event parameters, see 4312277d9e9c622958765e4a283750ba408abf2b.

Or we can extend `Declaration` to indicate that certain names should not participate in the name lookup, see 31cc9959911a131e2f9fcc1d80d8161e1c1f167e.

> All names are self-sufficient, but for some, there is no code that can refer to them, isn't it?

I would say that name is self-sufficient if it does not require any qualifier to identify to the corresponding entity :). 
But I agree, `isVisibleAsUnqualifiedName` sounds more precise.

Commits are not squashed and there is no changelog entry, but otherwise I believe it can be reviewed.

Just to summarize the current status: there were some review comments above but all have been addressed. The PR is finished and just waiting for an approve.

I found a new case that is not covered by this PR. It's function parameters shadowing types of other parameters:

```solidity
contract C {
    enum EnumType1 {A, B, C}
    enum EnumType2 {A, B, C}

    function z(EnumType1 EnumType2) external returns (EnumType2 EnumType1) {}
}
```

This results in `Error: Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract.`
This is the same problem this PR solves for structs but this time for function parameters. And unfortunately it does not nicely fit the `Declaration::isVisibleAsUnqualifiedName()` approach. That's because the function tells us if a declaration can never be referenced with name alone and this is not the case for functions that have a body.

To solve it I'd have to add a special case in `resolveName()` and that's what `isVisibleAsUnqualifiedName()` was supposed to let us avoid. So I'm not sure how to proceed here.

We discussed it today and the prevailing opinion was that for functions with a body we do want the shadowing to be disallowed. So the behavior that I caught in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10908#issuecomment-838725246 is correct.

As such, this PR is ready for another review. I added new test cases and did some minor reformatting but the only significant change after the last approve from @hrkrshnn was the one mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10908#discussion_r630292453.

Here's a snippet that summarizes the current state of the PR. Errors/warnings in each case before and after the PR:

    // struct, event, error
    //

    function f(uint EnumType, EnumType x) external {}

    //
    // BEFORE: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    // BEFORE: Error: Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract.
    //
    // AFTER: OK

    function (uint EnumType, EnumType x) external h;
}

```

About the specific example of
```solidity
contract C {
    enum EnumType1 {A, B, C}
    enum EnumType2 {A, B, C}

    function z(EnumType1 EnumType2) external returns (EnumType2 EnumType1) {}
}
```
This should be an error as long as we have `{}` instead of `;`, because functions with empty body can have modifiers, while function without implementation cannot have modifiers. This is important because we said that shadowing is not a problem as long as there is no code the shadowing can cover. Modifier invocations are code that are inside the scope of the function, i.e. the parameters are visible in the modifier invocation.

OK. That's exactly what happens:

``` solidity
contract C {
    enum EnumType1 {A, B, C}
    enum EnumType2 {A, B, C}

    // BEFORE: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    // BEFORE: Error: Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract.
    //
    // AFTER:  Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    // AFTER:  Error: Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract. 
    function z1(EnumType1 EnumType2) external returns (EnumType2 EnumType1) {}

    // BEFORE: Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    // BEFORE: Error: Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract.
    //
    // AFTER:  OK 
    function z2(EnumType1 EnumType2) external virtual returns (EnumType2 EnumType1);
}
```

> Modifier invocations are code that are inside the scope of the function, i.e. the parameters are visible in the modifier invocation.

I just checked and looks like it's possible to shadow the type name inside modifier invocation. You do at least get a warning if the shadowing happens though. This case is unaffected by the PR (works the same before and after):

```solidity
enum EnumType {A, B, C}
struct StructType {uint x;}

contract C {
    modifier ms(StructType memory s) { _; }
    modifier mi(uint i) { _; }

    // Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    function f(uint EnumType) mi(EnumType) external {}

    // OK
    function g(uint x) ms(StructType(x)) external {}

    // Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    // Error: Type is not callable
    function h1(uint StructType) ms(StructType(StructType)) external {}

    // Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
    function h2(uint StructType) external {
        // Error: Type is not callable
        StructType(StructType);
    }
}
```

The last situation (functions `h1()` and `h2()`) is in line with what I would expect, i.e. you cannot use the struct type because it is shadowed, but the error message is wrong. The type is callable, it's just not the type that is being used.

I assume "Type is not callable" refers to
```
ms(StructType(StructType))
   ^^^^^^^^^^
```
and I don't see why the error is wrong. `StructType` resolves to the name of the variable, and since the variable is not of function type, you cannot call it.

I said it's wrong because `StructType` is not a type if it resolves to the name of a variable. It should just say that it's not callable. Or was it meant to say that the type of `StructType` is not callable?

Still, it's mostly a cosmetic issue and not affected by the PR. Are all the other errors/warnings I listed working as they should?

It could say "type of the expression is not callable" (if `StructType` were a variable of function type, it would work). I think everything is fine now.
