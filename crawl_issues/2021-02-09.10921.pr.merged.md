Can you add a tests that has a parameters as well in a function. That can transfer to mapping in state variable. For example:
```
interface IThing {
    /// @param v value to search for
    /// @return x a number
    /// @return y another number
    function value(uint256 v) external view returns (uint128 x, uint128 y);
}

contract Thing is IThing {
    struct Value {
        uint128 x;
        uint128 y;
    }

    mapping(uint256=>Value) public override value;
}
```

What should happen with natspec comment for parameter?

In this case it wouldn't inherit at all because of a mismatch of the parameters..

Only one more small question:
Should tests be in `invalid` directory, as I think they should not be there

> Also, I don't think we should have such "generic special cases". Instead, I think natspec inheritance should be handled differently for public state variables.

My code touches only the public state variable inheritance. Specifically it makes it not work when the inherited function has a different amount of return parameters... which seems a non-special generic case to me for failing inheritance (mismatch of function signature, at least from the documentation perspective, not from the ABI perspective)

> Please use tests that show properly how the natspec is inherited

As this was just a bug fix for a crash, I assumed we don't need any actual natspec test here, but I'll add one. I don't think the behavior changed really other than fixing the crash and keeping the logic of requiring matching amount of (return-)parameters..

Well, it is invalid in terms of inheritance won't work. I guess it's not invalid in the sense that no documentation at all is generated...

Let's leave then where they are

@chriseth so this is updated now according to your suggestion to make it properly inherit the return parameter docu.

One thing though: All method `returns` documentation occurrences use `returns` (with an s) where as all public state variables so far used `return`. 

Example of state variable return docu:

```
		"methods" : {},
		"stateVariables" :
		{
			"state" :
			{
				"details" : "example of dev",
				"return" : "returns state"
			}
		}
	}
```
Example of a method
```
		"methods":
		{
			"g(int256)":
			{
				"returns":
				{
					"y": "value"
				}
			}
		}
```

But public variables with multiple return values now mix kind of both:

```
		"stateVariables":
		{
			"value":
			{
				"return":
				{
					"x": "a number",
					"y": "another number"
				}
			}
		}

```

Should we consistently use `returns` or should we use `return` for state variables for only one return parameter and `returns` for multiple?

I would propose to use both `return` and `returns`. If there is just a single return parameter documentation, then put that inside `return` but also inside `returns`. If there are multiple, only use `returns`.

But doesn't that make it more difficult for any automatic tool that wants to parse the json?

If we do it as a breaking change, the tools also have to implement both, because they want to support multiple versions.

We can do a breaking change with the next breaking release, though.

So, just for clarification @chriseth Is your proposal only for public variables? Because functions still use `returns` even if it's multiple

Only backwards-compatibility for public variables.
