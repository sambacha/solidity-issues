the revert tests you mentioned will all fail because the checking is based on syntax and not on types, but I can add them if you want. We did not revive `throw` because exceptions have a different behaviour in other languages: People might expect them to be caught inside the same call and not to revert the state changes.

Yeah, I saw that they'll fail - I'd still make them cases, though, but maybe not too important.

And well, ok, fair enough with exceptions being different elsewhere... but I find this syntactic trickery with ``revert`` and ``require`` and sharing a namespace with regular functions and all that here also rather messy... but well, maybe the best option in the end. (No need to roll up a discussion about it, I was mainly curious.)

"sharing namespace with regular functions" - all identifiers share a namespace. It is the same with events.

Fair enough, but there's explicitly no situation in which an event can be used just as if it was a function, is there?
And yeah, restricting the use to the exact syntactic pattern just seems a bit weird and hacky to me - it kind of looks like errors are functions that return some ephemeral unnamed special error type and ``require`` and ``revert`` are overloaded over that - but that's not it...  (actually it *could* work like that, even with a namable error type, that would just make it harder to only abi-encode late, wouldn't it?) - but well, might just take some getting used to...

Is there an issue for this or only the pull requests? I am wondering if we should consider the enum datatype encoding rules.

Basically my understanding is that one problem people face is the long error strings are expensive, so they want to reduce that cost, but still be able to tell errors apart. Currently we only support stripping every error string, which is not ideal.

Now with having various error types, with optional data, this problem is solved. However thinking about the try/catch implementation, they will need to add a catch clause for every single error as they have a different signature. I am not sure if this is an advantage or disadvantage.

It would be nice to see what error types people would add in a single ERC777 implementation for example.

I don't expect catching errors to be too popular because I cannot think of two many reasons why people would react differently to different errors. It is possible, but you can also just return a proper error code from the contract (i.e. not using revert) and if you do that, you also know that the error code comes from the contract. Errors always have the possibility of being bubbled up from another contract that is called indirectly.

Two more test ideas:
- Name collision between globally defined error and an error defined in a contract (or is shadowing allowed?)
- `require(condition, Error())` and `require(condition, Panic())`

Closing since this has been superseeded.
