I'm working off of 

```
Version: 0.8.2-develop.2021.2.5+commit.2fb27884.Linux.g++
```
and don't know what caused this error but now i can't get away from it 

```
CompileError: Exception during compilation: /solidity/libevmasm/Instruction.h(267): Throw in function solidity::evmasm::Instruction solidity::evmasm::swapInstruction(unsigned int)

This seems to be some code generation error on the regular EVM path (note `libevmasm`).

Can you post the source code please?

@fxfactorial can you share the offending source code? It is hard to figure out what is going on without it.

Sorry friends, I since lost this code and fixed it in another way, now don't have it. 

sorry for the noise/distraction
