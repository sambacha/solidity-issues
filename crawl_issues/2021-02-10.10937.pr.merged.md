# [\#10937 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10937) `merged`: Custom error documentation

This is a draft because we do not want unimplemented / unmerged things to be documented.

Closes #8080

Can we say that this PR solves #8080?

Updated. It should now cover everything. The documentation of the error concept is a bit messy because of the changes over the lifetime. At some point we should re-write it, I think, but maybe not in this PR...

Having re-written the code examples, I actually find that `if (!condition) revert MyError();` actually is not too unweildy - it often even feels more natural to invert the condition.

Somehow cmdlinetests splits the source snippets in the documentation in between a contract...

Weird, the version check is failing...
