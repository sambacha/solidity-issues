This also needs the code disabled that uses uninitialized return variables to fetch a zero value.

@chriseth I think this may now be worth a look. It's a minimal version that pretty much *only* deals with the precise situation needed for the stack limit evader, but this way I think I could keep it readable and sane... reusing variables cross-scopes in other situations would have to be (even) more invasive...

I'd suggest to keep preventing the yul optimiser from using the fact that the return values are zero separate, I'm just looking into that. The naive approach of just not zeroing them in the data-flow analyser might be a bit harsh, because if the user code referred to them they'd not reduce to zero and ideally we'd want to get rid of those as well, right?

Looking at some assembly that's generated in this context, I think it could be beneficial to enable inlining for "ordinary jump + jump out". After this change it becomes more likely that the function exit label only does the return label and return variable shuffling, so it can very well just be ``JUMPDEST SWAP1 JUMP /* out */`` (for functions with one argument).
Whenever we have a ``leave`` we'll still have ``PUSHTAG(exit_tag) JUMP`` - but we could just inline ``SWAP1 JUMP`` and get rid of the function exit ``JUMPDEST``. Saving one byte in code size and 11 runtime gas in the ``leave`` case (push and jump)...

On the other hand, we have to be aware that this change implicitly will *increase* code size, since it will likely move ``POP``s from after the function exit ``JUMPDEST`` further up, requiring more ``POP``s at every ``leave`` before it jumps. Probably worth it, but also worth mentioning :-).

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10899 would be the start of a path of being able to fuzz this... might be nice to do before merging, if we're fine with potentially waiting with this until after the next release.

Another thing by the way since it came up in the channel:
The effect of all functions with the same signature (# of args and # of ret params) sharing the same exit after the block deduplicator is run is diminished a bit by this PR, because less of the swapping happens after the exit label than before. I think it's fine and still worthwhile, but maybe good to keep in mind that this has all kinds of side-effects...

Rebased.

I now split it into add tests first with the expectation relative to develop, then change the code transform and then update the test expectations, because otherwise without the comments in the extracted tests the tests would probably be hard to read.
I think the third commit showing the changes in the test expectations, though, is hopefully fine to review.

This is by the way now a version with minimal effect on anything, but what's required for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10015
