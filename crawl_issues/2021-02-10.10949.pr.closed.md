# [\#10949 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10949) `closed`: Throw unimplemented assert for fixedpoint types early to help Fuzzer

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10941

Hopefully this prevents fuzzer from generating issues related to fixedpoint types.

Hmm... likes like this needs a deeper look because we expect fixed point typed stmts to be parsed elsewhere in the test suite.

@bshastry Yeah. I thought that `soltest` would convert these throws into "proper" messages. Maybe I'm missing something. Will take a look tomorrow.

I'm not sure we should do this. The idea of the current handling of fixed points is that analysis has them largely implemented already - and we do even (intentionally!) have tests for that - all of which you just disable with this :-).

@ekpyron Yeah, not sure what is a good way ahead. Fix each of the fuzzer issues by adding an unimplemented assert at the right location or just throw as early as possible for now. I think, the fuzzer will generate a lot of these issues for IR, so I think fixing these individually is too cumbersome.

So far (after a few days of fuzzing) unfixed issues seem to be the only ones listed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10941

I'm not familiar with IR code in general but perhaps fixing those two may be sufficient for now? At least hope so :-)

Edit: I meant to say unfixed fixed point assertion violations.

In that case, I'll just close this and fix the two issues by adding asserts. But I'm not convinced that there won't be any more fixed point related crashes
