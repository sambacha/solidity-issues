# [\#10961 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10961) `closed`: Gnosis safe contracts SMT checker stack overflow

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2021-02-13 10:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10961):

Flattened test that triggers a stack-overflow via SMTChecker. Possibly related to nested expressions creating too many stack frames in the process of solving for constraints.

> What error do you get here?

Here's how I've managed to debug this issue so far. Run the test in this PR with say isoltest and gdb. Print each source unit name before BMC analysis, each contract, each function and so on. Obtain the stack trace and print log (https://gist.github.com/bshastry/c0752f16c3952e8a1fcbe0813c033318)

Looking at the debug log (gist), it looks like BMC analysis does not complete and throws a seg fault (presumably because of infinite loop/recursion beyond a certain threshold, see gist). The solidity source that I could narrow down is here: https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/safe-contracts/blob/94f9b9083790495f67b661bfa93b06dcba2d3949/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L158-L159

Please note that debugging this requires the full test attached, since the source statements that trigger the SMT checker recursion are to be found in `GnosisSafe` contract which has several dependencies (imports).

Forgot to mention that `pragma experimental SMTChecker` has been added to each source unit to force SMT checker to run. Vanilla Gnosis safe does not trigger this issue since it does not make use of SMT checker.

Thank you, this is new. I think there is a different problem as well: That the SMTChecker recurses too much and eventually runs out of memory.

Does it actually run out of memory for you or do you just suspect that it could? It didn't for me on this test but I haven't really checked if the stack trace when it crashes. Might be just as big as the one you posted. Though I suspect it isn't because on the original file it runs for ~3 mins before the crash while on the reduced one it crashes instantly.

Not sure I follow. The full stack trace on running the fuzzer binary against the test file in this PR (should be reproducible via isoltest as well) is here: https://gist.github.com/bshastry/c0752f16c3952e8a1fcbe0813c033318

Ah, right. I didn't look at that stack trace closely enough.

I mean, how do I reproduce the segmentation fault from this stack trace outside of the fuzzer? Did it just run on the test case from this PR or was it mutating it in some way?

It ran exactly on the test case from this PR. I tried an ASan run of isoltest like so but I feel a non ASan run should also run out of memory eventually.

```
$ gdb -q --args ./build/test/tools/isoltest -t <test_from_this_pr>
...
Received SIGKILL
```

Edit: Ah you are right, debugging SIGKILL is not possible iiuc inside gdb. In which case, I don't know how to debug this outside of the fuzzer yet.

I would like to reduce the test case that causes stack overflow a bit. But definitely we should create issues I think :-)

Could you please create an issue for the ICE you found earlier in this thread? I will work a bit more on reducing the stack overflow test case and on reproducing it outside the fuzzer :-)

I think the linked issue is a separate one. Iirc, this issue is still a problem

Rebased on current develop. Let's see if it still fails now that the ICE has been fixed.

Before the rebase it was failing in [t_osx_soltest](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/13489/workflows/cc41aa02-ddee-4f23-b88e-2a30fe2e4f2b/jobs/624955) with the same ICE I was getting while in [t_archlinux_soltest](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/13489/workflows/cc41aa02-ddee-4f23-b88e-2a30fe2e4f2b/jobs/624956) `soltest` was getting killed (presumably due to running out of stack space).

OK, still failing, just no ICE. Tried it locally and it actually run out of memory after 5 minutes.
I'll try to find a small repro for that tomorrow.

I also get this locally:
```
--- SKIPPING ALL SEMANTICS TESTS ---

Running tests...

smtCheckerTests/safe_contracts.sol: Killed
```

Sometimes these problems are just too hard. I get the same locally with the Circles Hub.sol contract. Not sure we can do much about it besides the current abstraction approaches. Maybe it's better to keep this as an open issue and keep rerunning sometimes?

Reopening this temporarily just to add my changes to the repro.

I spent quite a bit of time today trying to trim it down to a small snippet that still causes it to run out of memory but unfortunately I was unsuccessful. Still, I reduced it from ~3000 lines to ~600 so maybe it's small enough now to try to do something with it.

What I pushed now is the smallest code that still makes isoltest run out of memory on my system. Any substantial simplification I tried makes it finish after ~5 minutes of grinding and report errors instead. But it's not like it starts behaving completly differently - I think that removing more stuff just gradually reduces resource usage and the thing I have here is just the point at which it manages to stay within available RAM on my system. On another system with a different amount of RAM it could start doing it at a different point.

At one point I tried removing `require`s and there was one that reduced running time almost in half:
```solidity
require(ISignatureValidator(currentOwner).isValidSignature(data, contractSignature) == EIP1271_MAGIC_VALUE, "Invalid contract signature provided");
```
Unfortunately this does not seem to be this `require` alone. It behaved that way on a slightly modified version with a few more small things removed but on what I pushed here, removing it did not have that effect. Still, might be something worth taking a look.

Overall, I suspect that it's just the general complexity of the contract that makes SMTChecker run out of resources and maybe we should just treat it as a stress/performance test.

One thing I should add is that while there are still over 600 lines, removing all the unused stuff made the structure much clearer. The file at the end (`GnosisSafe.sol`) is the main contract that has the most important logic. Its functions call each other and there might even be some recursion (not sure) which might be the reason it's so heavy. The rest are smaller contracts `GnosisSafe` inherits from and their dependencies. Many functions in these dependencies are either unused or can be removed with just slight modifications. Stuff is pretty easy to remove now but removing it makes it no longer crash so I left it at that.

Thanks for the simplifications @cameel !
One likely reason why we see the problem with BMC and not CHC is that BMC checks whether `if` and `require` conditions are constant and CHC doesn't.
I'll take a look at the simplifier version later today.

You probably have more RAM than me then :) It does get killed in CI so that would confirm that the computation is just heavy rather than falling into an infinite loop due to a bug.

Yea I think so too. So I'm closing again in favor of the issue.
