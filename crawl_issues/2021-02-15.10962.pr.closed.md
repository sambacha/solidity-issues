Needed to form template functions inside protobuf mutator in a follow up PR

Yeah, you are right. The naming makes readability worse. Here is the motivation for this. I would like to write a custom mutation that adds control flow inside basic blocks. The template parameter `T` here is the enclosing type that contains basic blocks e.g., if stmt, for stmt, switch case stmt etc. Earlier one had to write a separate function for each type, but now since all statement types that contain a block statement have the same name, we can just template it and make the mutation code more readable.

```
template <typename T>
void YPM::addControlFlow(T* _msg)
{
	enum class ControlFlowStmt: unsigned
	{
		For = 0,
		BoundedFor,
		If,
		Switch,
		FunctionCall,
		Break,
		Continue,
		Leave,
		Termination
	};
	uniform_int_distribution<unsigned> d(
		static_cast<unsigned>(ControlFlowStmt::For),
		static_cast<unsigned>(ControlFlowStmt::Termination)
	);
	auto random = static_cast<ControlFlowStmt>(d(s_rand.m_random));
	Statement* s = _msg->mutable_block()->add_statements();
	switch (random)
	{
	case ControlFlowStmt::For:
		s->set_allocated_forstmt(new ForStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::BoundedFor:
		s->set_allocated_boundedforstmt(new BoundedForStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::If:
		s->set_allocated_ifstmt(new IfStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::Switch:
		s->set_allocated_switchstmt(new SwitchStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::FunctionCall:
		s->set_allocated_functioncall(new FunctionCall());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::Break:
		s->set_allocated_breakstmt(new BreakStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::Continue:
		s->set_allocated_contstmt(new ContinueStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::Leave:
		_msg->mutable_block()->add_statements()->set_allocated_leave(new LeaveStmt());
		break;
	case ControlFlowStmt::Termination:
		_msg->mutable_block()->add_statements()->set_allocated_terminatestmt(new TerminatingStmt());
		break;
	}
}
```

What would change in the above code if we don't do the refactoring?

We can't use a templated function anymore. It boils down to this line which adds a new statement to a basic block (belonging to any enclosing statement type e.g., if, for, switch).

> 	Statement* s = _msg->mutable_block()->add_statements();

Without this refactoring, this would be

> 	Statement* s = _msg->mutable_for_body()->add_statements();

> 	Statement* s = _msg->mutable_default_block()->add_statements();

> 	Statement* s = _msg->mutable_if_body()->add_statements();

For `for`, `switch`, and `if` statements respectively.

I could still do something like

```
if (is_same<ForStmt>(_msg)::value)

else if (is_same<SwitichStmt>(_msg)::value)

...

```

but I feel this makes the code less readable. So having to choose between less readable spec and code :-)

Is the second PR also ready. Maybe it makes more sense to review them together. What do you think?

Thank you for your review @hrkrshnn . I think renaming the blocks is a bad idea since it burdens code reading. I will now close this PR in favour of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10967
