# [\#10972 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10972) `merged`: [DOCS] Create robots.txt / Avoid search results showing docs of old Solidity versions

Trying to solve #10898.

I tried to solve the issue by following the following guides / instructions:
- https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/technical-docs-seo-guide.html#use-a-robots-txt-file
- https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#how-can-i-avoid-search-results-having-a-deprecated-version-of-my-docs
- https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/hosting.html#custom-robots-txt-pages

Since we are using Sphinx, the documentation says we should create the ``robots.txt`` file and put it under the path defined in ``html_extra_path``. I tried to do that but I'm not sure if I did it correctly. 

Can somebody check if what I did makes sense? Thank you! :)

Edit: Actually, in ``solidity/docs/conf.py`` it says "Add any extra paths that contain custom files (such as robots.txt or .htaccess) here, relative to this directory. These files are copied directly to the root of the documentation.". So probably we need to move the ``robots.txt``somewhere else and add the path there?

Why can't we put it directly in `_static`?
Apart from the path, I think it would be nice if we could generate this file so that we do not have to modify it whenever we create a new version.

Exactly. You should change `html_extra_path` in [`conf.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/conf.py) like this:
```patch
< html_extra_path = ["_static/css"]
---
> html_extra_path = ["_static/css", "_static/robots.txt"]
```
and then move `robots.txt` into the `_static/` directory.

In case setting it to `"_static/robots.txt"` does not work (it's a file not a path after all), you could also create a new directory (e.g. `_static/txt`) and use it instead.

> Apart from the path, I think it would be nice if we could generate this file so that we do not have to modify it whenever we create a new version.

Sounds doable. We could have a small Python script that reads versions from the file (or gets tags from github API), compares with the output of `get_version.sh` and re-generates it. The script could be triggered by `scripts/docs.sh`.

I checked out the links @franzihei provided and it looks like there's also another option. In ReadTheDocs you can mark specific versions as [hidden](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html#hidden). It even seems to have some [automation](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/pull/7265) so we wouldn't have to update the list of hidden versions on every release.

The downside is that hidden versions are not visible in the flyout menu (in the bottom-left corner) and the internal search engine won't find them so they will be completely unsearchable (so not just via Google). I guess this what people want for old versions most of the time, but in our case, since we have a strong commitment to keep the old compiler versions usable, that's not great.

But I see that the "hidden" feature has been fully implemented only very recently (e.g. #6935 was closed in December) and I've seen that the original feature request was bigger (e.g. it included being able to mark versions as "deprecated") so maybe it would be better to submit a feature request matching exactly what we need here? I.e. versions hidden from search engines but not from users?

One more thing, I've found [a comment that indicates that just hiding these versions in `robots.txt` might be confusing to search engines because links to them still remain in the site map](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5391#issuecomment-680108312). The issue is open so I guess it's applies to the "hidden" feature too.

@axic mentioned last week he worked on this and had done something locally and didn't push it yet, so just pinging him here before we do any double work. :)

@cameel yes I saw the ``hidden``feature, too, but we want the versions to still be available in the flyout menu and searchable in the local search on the readthedocs site... 

I've also read about the problems with the ``robots.txt``file not being the optimal solution, but in lack of a better one, I would still propose to go ahead with it, or wdyt?

Yeah, I know. The option is not really usable as is but I'm just suggesting that it's a fresh feature so maybe the Sphinx guys would be open to adjusting it so that what we want is possible.

I don't have much against going forward with it. The only thing is the potential problem with robots being confused because the site still links to these old versions that I mentioned above. But this seems hard to verify without just trying it out so maybe we should just do it.

Perhaps we could ask the user who suggested about robots.txt to review this?

I'm basically just not doing anything since @axic indicated he had worked on this locally. If not, we can also just change the path and move the file and then we should be good to go? (Except for the automation point of view)

Maybe that would be another point to make WRT EIP 2315: Just say that @axic has some additional local work on it :)

That is always a working "get out of jail" card!

Which change disappeared @cameel?

My suggestion about the comment: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10972#discussion_r604899335 (`# Prevent development and old documentation from showing up in search results.`).

Not like it's all that important but you applied it so I think this is just a problem with rebasing.

Yes I also realized just after my comment :D The rebasing was very weird... let me try to add it again.

I'll go ahead and merge it. Looks like everyone agrees that it's fine to do so now and tweak it later.
