This PR replaces #10332.

I fixed the problems I listed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10332#issuecomment-777617557 and I think I have implemented all the changes that actually affect what's in the graph. ~I'm still not done with some refactors suggested in the old PR like using a queue when visiting nodes adjusting some names or changing the way checks are done. I'm pushing what I have now as a draft but these changes are pretty small so I think I'll be done. The PR should at least already be correct and pass all tests.~ The PR is now ready.

This PR contains a core logic of 200 lines, yet there is a test file of ten times that - is that really necessary, especially since we cross-check the result at each compilation?

I just pushed updated code. I fixed/changed everything that is now marked as resolved. Of the unresolved ones, the only two on my todo list are: returning the graph by value (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10973#discussion_r578300886) and simplifying the construction-time edges (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10973#discussion_r578300322). The others are waiting for feedback.

It's more like 500 lines of implementation vs 2000 lines of tests so not *that* bad :) Well, what can I say, long and repetitive tests are long and repetitive. 2k lines is a lot and it also was a pain to write but I don't really think it's too much for this PR. The implementation is relatively short but I think this feature has quite a big "surface". Just look at this PR. There are ~90 comments even before anyone started seriously reviewing these tests. The old PR ran into ~250 and we had to close it to ease it's suffering. While a lot of them are just style issues there was also an unusually high number that pointed out actual bugs. I think this is because there are just a lot of different combinations in which things can call each other and it's hard to visualize that without actually going through them all systematically. Which is exactly what I did here and the size of these tests just shows how big that surface is.

I don't think the cross-check is sufficient for testing this. It ignores constructors, modifiers, events and contract creation. And there were actually bugs or missing pieces of implementation in all of these things. It only checks which functions are present but not if they're connected correctly. The check also runs only on semantic tests (because graph verification is in IR generator) and I'm not sure if they cover all the important cases for this.

After writing these tests I do feel pretty confident in just going ahead, changing stuff because I know it's covered. And if it's not, I add a new case and it stays fixed instead of getting broken again while I work on the next fix. I don't think I would feel that confident about it if I was relying only on these checks. I might just have gotten bogged down in the implementation, fixing one thing while breaking another two.

One way I could have made these tests smaller would be by just finding existing .sol files, loading them from files at runtime and writing expectations for them. I think it would take me a lot more time that just writing this out though. So in a way I traded test size for development time here :)

This is now ready for another round. I squashed the fixups because there were a lot of them and it's probably easier just to go through the implementation again.

Please squash so it can be merged.

Squashed.

I have also added a small change in the builder docstring to account for the fact that after my changes it's not only the bottom-most constructor that has an edge from `Entry`.
