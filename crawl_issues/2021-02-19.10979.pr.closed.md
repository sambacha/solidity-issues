# [\#10979 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10979) `closed`: Fix use canonical

I would wait until there is consensus on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10976 to figure out which fix is better

One more thing. One reason for not using `canonical()`/`absolute()` might be that this function is used only for imports and they are (by design, see e.g. #6608) more limited than paths in general. For example we don't support Windows-style path separators while these functions probably do.

So we'd have to make sure that e.g. `canonical()` on Windows does not replace every `/` with `\`.

Also, maybe we should move this function out of `CommonIO.cpp` because with assumptions like that it's not really a generic utility as the name would suggest.

I've changed this PR to a draft due to the discussion in this thread esp https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10979#issuecomment-782182559

@bshastry My suggestion for this PR was a bit misguided as it turns out. This function is not really concerned with actual files in the filesystem. It works with relative imports of the form `./contract.sol` or `../contract.sol` (as described in #11263) to convert them into "absolute" ones. But they are only absolute in the context of `CompilerStack`'s virtual filesystem. The resulting path is not used to locate file on disk unless it gets to the file loader and that's a separate mechanism.

Very generic name of this function (`solidity::util::absolutePath()`) is very deceiving in that regard. I'm going to move it into a more specific class in my refactor.

So anyway, I'm closing this because I think that we do not want `canonical()` here after all.
