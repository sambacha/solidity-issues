<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

The error I'm getting here (tested on 0.8.1) is the same as the one in #10986 that I have just reported:

```
SMT logic error during analysis:
/solidity/libsmtutil/Z3Interface.cpp(270): Throw in function z3::expr solidity::smtutil::Z3Interface::toZ3Expr(const solidity::smtutil::Expression&)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::smtutil::SMTLogicError>
std::exception::what: Sorts Int and bytes_tuple are incompatible
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Sorts Int and bytes_tuple are incompatible
```

Are you able to reproduce it against EVM versions other than homestead and spuriousDragon?

Yeah, `tangerineWhistle`.

`tangerineWhistle`, `homestead` and `spuriousDragon`: ICE.
`byzantium`, `constantinople`, `petersburg`, `istanbul` and `berlin`: OK.

I think that's all of them.

Thank you. I'm wondering if version specific issues may have a different root cause, or if it's better to just move this to #10986 Wdyt?

I'm not sure. They could be caused by different things that just trigger the same generic message at a higher layer. The error here seems to be related to returndata not being available in these EVM versions (we have a public getter that returns a struct). #10986 on the other hand consistently fails regardless of EVM version (I just checked them all).

Another ICE for the specific evm versions in this issue

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C{function f()public returns(bool[]memory){this.f();}}
```
