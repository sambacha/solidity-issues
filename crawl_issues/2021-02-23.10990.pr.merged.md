# [\#10990 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10990) `merged`: Call graph as contract annotation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-02-23 09:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10990):

Depends on #10973.

This is a refactor on top of #10973 that moves the call graph from `CompilerStack` to an annotation on contract definition. This makes it more convenient to access it.

The PR is already complete and ready for review but waiting for #10973 to get merged.

The graph PR has been accepted so I'm marking this as ready for review.
