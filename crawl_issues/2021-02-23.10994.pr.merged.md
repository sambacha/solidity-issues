# [\#10994 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10994) `merged`: Remove the last remains of --ast-json option

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-02-23 11:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10994):

The legacy AST has already been removed by #10363 and #9512. Why are we we still keeping the `--ast-json` option available in the CLI?

This PR removes the option from the CLI and also removes some stray mentions/uses from docs and scripts.
