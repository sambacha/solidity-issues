We ignore errors in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10996#discussion_r582948046 because the ast can be exported for not fully valid source code.

About the NatSpec issue:

Concatenating the NatSpec of events with same signature sounds good.

There is this edge case, which should be two different events in the NatSpec, but ends up being the same since we omit the "indexed" part from signature.

```
library L {
    /// library
    event E(uint indexed a);
}
contract  C {
    constructor() {
        emit L.E(1);
    }
    /// contract
    event E(uint a);
}
```

Also, `web3.py` seems to throw an error when accessing an event with name `E` if there are multiple events with name `E` in the ABI. Makes me wonder if we should disallow events with the same name, even though at EVM level they make sense.

Actually concatenating natspec does not really work. Do we concatenate the values of all the different fields? What if the parameters have different names?

About events and NatSpec. Currently the AST id issue will lead to weird natspec.

```solidity
  library L {
	  /// one
	  event E();
  }
  contract C {
	  /// two
	  event E();
	  function f() public { emit L.E(); }
  }
```
has the NatSpec 

```
======= <stdin>:C =======
User Documentation
{
  "events":
  {
    "E()":
    {
      "notice": "two"
    }
  },
  "kind": "user",
  "methods": {},
  "version": 1
}
```
whereas for the following,

```solidity
  contract C {
	  /// two
	  event E();
	  function f() public { emit L.E(); }
  }
  library L {
	  /// one
	  event E();
  }
```

the NatSpec is:

```
======= <stdin>:C =======
User Documentation
{
  "events":
  {
    "E()":
    {
      "notice": "one"
    }
  },
  "kind": "user",
  "methods": {},
  "version": 1
}
```

Not sure if we should ignore this.

We should just use an array and include all events defined or used in the contract.

It seems not only events missed in ABI, but also some custom errors: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13149

Yeah, I remember that this came up when @Marenz was working on adding events and errors to `--hashes` option. I thought we had that reported somewhere. It would be a good idea to take care of that together with this PR. Which probably means the next version since we want to get it merged very soon.

After taking a closer look at #13149, that's actually not the problem I had in mind. It actually works like that by design.

Just a heads up: when #13391 is merged, we should recheck that this PR does not break it and maybe add some more test cases if not all edge cases of event inheritance are covered.

I noticed that if you call a library function that emits an event, the event is not part of the contract's ABI. A custom error, on the other hand, it is included. For example:

```solidity
library Lib {
  event MyEvent();
  error MyError();

  function f() internal {
    emit MyEvent();
  }

  function g() internal pure {
    revert MyError();
  }
}


contract Foo {
  function f() public {
    Lib.f();
  }

  function g() public pure {
    Lib.g();
  }
}
```

The ABI of Foo includes `MyError` but not `MyEvent`.

Does this PR fix that? Or should I open a new issue about this?

Yes. It should work like that for both but we could only do it for errors without breaking backwards compatibility. The same change for events in this PR was waiting for Natspec v2. In the end we decided to work around the problem in a non-breaking way and adjust the PR a little as described in #13086. This adjusted version is waiting for review now but we had a huge PR backlog for a while and this had to wait. We're planning to get back to it soon though. Probably 0.8.19.

Well, as far as breaking anything - it didn't, since the build is green after rebasing (I did have to touch up the Natspec PR changes). I've also opened a PR to introduce a multiple inheritance test (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14048), but I'm not sure if there's anything else that should be covered. Would the diamond pattern be an edge case?

@nikola-matic Yeah, I mostly meant multiple inheritance since that's the case when you have the userdoc coming from multiple sources.

After looking at this PR now though, looks like it can't break anything. Defining the same event in multiple base contracts it's disabled. We still have to check that but that's only after we relax restrictions on events defined in multiple places.

There are these two pending questions/comments:
 * https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10996#discussion_r1164276826 - comment about filtering events not part of the external interface
 * https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10996#discussion_r1175235703 - add asserts (not a file-level event, an event from another contract)

The first one, I didn't quite understand, I guess it is about events emitted in private/internal functions ?
The second one I am working on it.

We'd need to ask @chriseth about the comment, I think he's the one who wrote it. Would be best to find out, because it's confusing, but it's not serious enough to block the PR.

Asserts are also just nice to have. They shouldn't be anything elaborate. Only things you can check fairly easily without writing lots of support code that's not used for anything else.

> The extra tweaks we discussed would be nice but I'm also already approving since they're not important enough to block merging the PR.

Ok. I just added the asserts in a different commit so they can be removed if we want to merge the PR without them.
Also, I thought that events could not be emitted from inherited interfaces. I was not sure so I added some tests about that.
