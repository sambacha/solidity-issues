Changes how function calls are synthesized (making them appear more often).

Thanks for the review @leonardoalt 

I rebased the PR and added a tiny update (remove out_params from function call spec). This is no longer needed (but I forgot to remove them). The diff beyond what you have already reviewed are four lines in `yulProto.proto` that define output parameters for a function call.

These have been removed because the converter creates a multi declaration statement for a function call assignment, like so

```
let x_1, ..., x_n = function_that_returns_n_values(i_1, ..., i_n)
```

The inputs (upto 4 parameters are supported) remain as they are. It's only the output parameters that are not needed.
