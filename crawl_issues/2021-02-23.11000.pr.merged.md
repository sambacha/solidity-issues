# [\#11000 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11000) `merged`: Fix isDynamicallyEncoded() for structs containing internal types

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-02-23 16:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11000):

Fixes  #10516.

This PR changes the implementation of `isDynamicallyEncoded()` for structs to just use the member types directly instead of their `interfaceType()`. This does not seem to be causing any problems but I don't know why `interfaceType()` was used there in the first place.

Why shouldn't `interfaceType` be called here? I actually think that `isDynamicallyEncoded` should not be called on non-external types in the first place. Can you check where it is called from?

It's not that it shouldn't but I think it does not have to. Couldn't we tell for every type (no matter whether it's a part of the ABI or not) if it's dynamically sized?

`TypeChecker::visit(VariableDeclaration)` uses `validForLocation()` on the parameter and for `ArrayType` this function calls `isDynamicallySized()`.

`validForLocation` for structs and arrays should check that they don't contain internal types for calldata. The problem is that internal types are valid for calldata if it is an array or struct and a library is about to be called. I'll investigate a bit more.

I have a different fix and will force-push here shortly.

ok. Your fix looks correct to me and passes my test cases.
