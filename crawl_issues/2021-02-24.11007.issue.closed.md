## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

```
contract B {
  function g() public {}
}
contract C is B {
  bytes4 constant s2 = B.g.selector;
}
```

The issue is related to referencing the selector via base contract i.e., `B.g.selector`. If we do `this.g.selector` instead, the ICE goes away.

Also, the issue is related to `public` functions. For external functions, the ICE does not reproduce (see below)

```
contract B {
  function g() external {}
}
contract C is B {
  bytes4 constant s2 = B.g.selector;
}
```

It's really good to have the fuzzer! This is related to the callgraph PR.
