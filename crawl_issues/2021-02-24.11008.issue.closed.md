If we have #11006, that means framework can filter warnings/errors based on error codes. If we advocate/allow that, then we may want to consider adding a way to filter error codes on the command line, i.e. `--ignore-errors <comma separated error codes>`.

I am personally not fully sold on having this, but created the issue for completeness and a way to discuss this.

I'm also not fully sold. For casually calling `solc *.sol`, this is not required. If you do anything more fancy, then you probably use a framework that has a project settings file which can contain any filtering instructions the framework can do.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
