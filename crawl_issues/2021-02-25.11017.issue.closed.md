This would allow `msg.sender.transfer{gas: max}(2 ether);`, which would then be the recommended way to implement the withdraw pattern.

The downside of `all` is that it might lead to people thinking that it forwards `gas()`, but it actually only forards `gas() * 63/64`.

While this would be better than the current situation, it leaves the path of least resistance as "the wrong path" and the path of most resistance as "the right path".  I would rather see `.transfer` and `.send` deprecated (meaning they emit a compiler warning or they simply don't exist anymore) and we introduce a new method.

----

Re: naming:
I feel like `.receive()` is a great choice for today if all we are doing is setting gas cost to max.  It aligns exactly with what I would *expect* as a contract developer since contracts can have a `function receive() payable` on them and it is well documented what it does.

If/when `SELFDESTRUCT` gets replaced with `SENDETH`, we can create a *new* function for `.sendeth()` which will do exactly what it says on the tin and nothing more.

@axic so you would be open to a silent breaking change of `transfer`?

@MicahZoltu I would prefer to keep the symmetry of send and receive. We could use some other words like "remit" - although I'm not too firm in english to make such a decision.

I also see the problem that the "right path" is more complicated, but at least it is less complicated than
```
(bool success,) = x.call{value: amount}("");
require(success);

I agree that a silent breaking change is dangerous because it confuses people, and people might be surprised when they find the behavior of `transfer` has changed.

Adding an option of `{gas: max}` looks like a good choice. But a potential problem is that this syntax may encourage people to **setting the gas to a fixed value** when transferring, e.g. `{gas: 2300}`, which should be avoided. (See [documents](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.1/control-structures.html#external-function-calls))

By the way, we should allow `try` / `catch` with transfer: [Chriseth's post on Solidity Forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/a-better-design-for-ether-transfer/100/3?u=lonelyenvoy)
This is a backward compatible change, does not require a new function name, and is natural.

I would prefer `remit` (or really any name) over the current situation or over the current proposal (`contract.transfer{ gas: max }`).

Another option, which I like less than a new named function but more than the current proposal, would be to do `address.transfer{ gas: max }` but disallow anything *other* than `gas: max` in there and *require* it for anyone who uses `.transfer`.  If you want to limit gas, you have to do it via the much more complicated `x.call{...}` syntax, making the bad path the hard path.

> I would prefer to keep the symmetry of send and receive.

There isn't symmetry like this anywhere else in the language when you call a contract.  For example, if you want to call `function getFoo()` on a contract you don't call `Contract.setFoo()`.  I think for software developers, it is natural to expect that `contract.receive()` will call the `receive` function on `contract`.  Seasoned Solidity developers will know that `receive` is a special function, and newbies will hopeful get a link to details about the `receive` function when they read the docs about how to send ETH.

If we call it `remit`, a newbie contract developer will go looking for a `remit` function on the recipient contract and may even *write* a `function remit() payable` function on the contract, because that is what one would *expect* to happen when you call a function on an address.

@chriseth @axic  Is it ok to get rid of gas observability? Some mass operations will become impossible.
For example, according to [this research paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3276486), many contracts are using this pattern, which is bad:
```solidity
contract NaiveBank {
  struct Account { 
    address addr;
    uint balance;
  }
  Account accounts[];
  function applyInterest() returns (uint) {
    for (uint i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
      // apply 5 percent interest
      accounts[i].balance = accounts[i].balance * 105 / 100;
    }
    return accounts.length; 
  }
}
```

The function will not be able to finish if `accounts` holds too many elements; it will throw an out-of-gas error.
The paper suggested the way below:
```solidity
  Account accounts[];
  uint nextAccount;
  function applyInterest() returns (uint) {
    for (uint i = nextAccount; i < accounts.length && msg.gas > 100000; i++) {
      // apply 5 percent interest
      accounts[i].balance = accounts[i].balance * 105 / 100; 
    }
    nextAccount = i < accounts.length ? i : 0;
    return accounts.length; 
  }
```

I understand it's better to use a "pull"-style than a "push"-style. However, it may be essential for some contracts to do such unbounded mass operation. How can they achieve this if `gasleft` is removed?

They can achieve that by having the function take in a page size and having the caller provide enough gas to execute that many iterations.

@MicahZoltu The gas required by a function can go above the block gas limit, which should be 12,500,000 currently. A simple  combination of `SLOAD` and `SSTORE` costs 20,800 gas. If this combination is placed inside a loop, then the function can at most run 600 loops before hitting the block gas limit. It then renders this function not usable anymore, which is the root cause of some Denial of Service problems.

I'm not sure how your latest point is related to the topic at hand?  Also, for the specific example given you should definitely *not* be handling interest that way, and really you should never have unbounded loops in code running on the EVM.  Even paged loops should be avoided whenever possible.

Ok, I understand. A paged loop can solve the problem, even though it's not a good practice.

Maybe in the document it should be more clear that writing code running on EVM is different from using traditional general-purpose languages due to the gas limitation; otherwise people won't notice such problems and their contracts will be error-prone and vulnerable.

I mostly agree with @axic and @MicahZoltu here. I think the `transfer` function should not specify the gas at all. But a silent breaking change sounds dangerous. Maybe we can deprecate `transfer` and have a new function, say `msg.sender.pay` that is equivalent to `call(gas(), ...)`. It's unfortunate that developers use `transfer` to a contract where the gas stipend is not enough and have their funds stuck forever. 

However, the problem with `transfer`, `remit` or `pay` is that the name is too generic and hides all the gas subtleties. The call option, `{gas: max}` solves this problem. Perhaps there should also be a `{gas: stipend}` option.

Maybe an alternative solution is to deprecate both `transfer` and `send` and have functions with more descriptive names in our planned standard library. For example, `transfer_allGas(address _a, uint _value) returns (bool success)` and `transfer_onlyStipend(address _a, uint _value) returns (bool success)`.

For a transitional period, we could require a gas option for `transfer` and then make "max" the default in a breaking change. The values could be `{gas: min}` (stipend), `{gas: max}`, or a specific number.

What problem do you believe is being solved by providing this as an option at all?
The goal is to get rid of the stipend, not just change the syntax people use to get the stipend.  If you have some contract that *absolutely* much use the stipend, then you can do `.call{ gas: 2300 }(bytes)`.  This is *intentionally* the hard path because you *really* should not be doing it.

> I would prefer to keep the symmetry of send and receive.

I would still like to see more discussion on this point.
Almost nowhere else in programming, and I don't think anywhere else in Solidity, does `xxx.apple(...)` result in anything *other* than the `apple` function getting called on `xxx`.  I feel like `xxx.receive()` is perfect here because it behaves *exactly* like the developer expects, which is that a function named `receive` will be called on `xxx`, which (from the Solidity language standpoint) is what will happen.

I would expect `send(source, destination)` for the syntax of a transfer where the recipient may receive a different callback method being called, or maybe even `send(source, destination.receive)`

@MicahZoltu Solidity doesn't hardcode the stipend (if the value is known to be non-zero.) The equivalent would be `.call{gas: 0, value: non-zero}(...)` and `.call{gas: 2300, value: 0}(...)`. I guess one advantage for `{gas: min}` for stipend would be to prevent users from hardcoding the stipend. Also, it allows for an easy replacement for users upgrading their contracts and were relying on `transfer` as a re-entrant safe way to send Ether. 

Also, why do you think people should not be using transfer with only stipend?

It makes it so often the calls don't work with contract wallets, which is something we want to encourage usage of rather than discourage usage of.  Also, gas prices change so 2300 might be enough to call a specific contract wallet today but not tomorrow, or potentially even not enough to call *any* address in the future.

I am a bit worried that we are introducing now introducing a lot special parser cases like `gas: min`, `gas: max`, etc.

How about we introduce a `gas` "global" with the fields `.stipend`, `.left` (== `gasleft()`), `.max`?
