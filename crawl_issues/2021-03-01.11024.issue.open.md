Example code:
syntaxTests/inlineAssembly/assignment_from_library.sol
```
    library L {
    }
    
    contract C {
      function f() public pure {
        assembly {
          let x := L
        }
      }
    }
```

IIRC when we looked at this it seemed like this would not be an error and just evaluate to zero for internal-only libraries, even for old codegen - I'd need to recheck, though... but is that desirable behaviour?

I wouldn't really call this a bug. Looks more like a missing feature.

Even if the library doesn't have any address and thereby there is no other value for this other than zero?

If you request an address of the library then it better have one. I mean all libraries have addresses, but some libraries addresses are just never needed.
