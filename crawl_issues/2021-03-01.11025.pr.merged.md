Since it came up that people want to know more about which aspects of Solidity came from where, maybe we should add a section in the documentation about it?

Sure, but do we have a good list of examples for each of these languages? Actually I think most of the JavaScript influence is gone, so maybe this would be a good place to explain that prior to version 0.4.0, features like scoping and the `var` construct were influenced by Javasrcipt.

We can create a new global item "influence", listing roughly:

Solidity used to be much more influenced by JavaScript in the beginning due to function-level scoping of variables and the use of the keyword `var`. This influence was more and more reduced starting with version 0.4.0. Now, the main similarity to JavaScript is that functions are defined using the keyword `function` and Solidity looks like most of the curly-braces languages.

Other influences were Python: Solidity's modifiers were added trying to model Python's decorators with a much more restricted functionality. Furthermore, multiple inheritance and the `super` keyword are taken from Python as well as the general lvalue semantics of value and reference types.

Oh, we could also list that `payable` was taken from an unnamed (?) language by Jack Pettersson and Robert Edström - https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/234939/234939.pdf

Really? Trying to decipher when, but the only record we have is https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/500#issuecomment-243630222 (and seemingly we discussed stuff like [`acceptValue`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/563)). The discussions started April 2016 or before.

Maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought I first considered such things after a talk I saw at devcon1 or devcon2.

By the way, using 'require' for preconditions appears to be from Eiffel's Design by Contract. Any references on that?

One of the first discussions was #1130 (and apparently here Design by Contract was mentioned, but I don't recall it being discussed beyond that stray comment). There was a very long argument about ensure/expect/require/assume/assert, but it seems we mostly discussed that through calls. We knew we wanted to separate input validation (preconditions) from unexpected behaviour (postconditions/invariants), hence the two keywords. One reference I could find though: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1762#issuecomment-286440592

Interesting, so it may have been a decision based on thesaurus results. Love it ;)

This link has examples in Eiffel in case you're interested, https://www.eiffel.com/values/design-by-contract/introduction/

I just found one more thing borrowed from JavaScript: [import syntax and semantics](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/layout-of-source-files.html#syntax-and-semantics).

> Solidity supports import statements to help modularise your code that are similar to those available in JavaScript (from ES6 on). However, Solidity does not support the concept of a default export.

[Imports in JavaScript for comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).
