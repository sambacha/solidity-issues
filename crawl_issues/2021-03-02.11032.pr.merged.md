# [\#11032 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11032) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix analysis of push to a string casted to bytes

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-03-02 18:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11032):

Fixes #10914.
This PR consists of two changes:
First change fixes the crash because of an invalid cast in case `push` is called on `string` casted to `bytes`.
The second change (introducing the `cleanExpression` method) ensures that the push is registered on the correct symbolic array.
