# [\#11040 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11040) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix bug in virtual functions called by constructor

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11058

The added test was buggy. Functions called by a constructor were still calling the one in scope and not the most derived one.
The fix here is rather unfortunate: we also need constructor versions in the context of the most derived contract, and we do need the entire CFG encoding including the entire inheritance, *for each* contract when it's considered the most derived contract. This makes the encoding pretty large, but I believe that's the only final solution to virtual calls.
Considering this, it might make sense to soon work on a user option that chooses the "most derived contract" that should be analyzed, similar to choosing for which contracts the bytecode should be output.

Yea I'll remove the comments.
The predicates re constructors are pretty much the same. What changes here is that there's some duplication on the constructor deployment predicates, for each contract that is considered the "most derived". If a contract does not inherit from another contract, nothing changes. If it does, you can think of the one that gets deployed as the most derived, and if we only analyze that one, there wouldn't be any duplication.

I have checked it again and it looks good to me. Both the idea and the implementation.

It actually depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11058, updated the first comment now.
