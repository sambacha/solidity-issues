## Description

A yul file with just a carriage return "\r" (e.g., generated by something like this python code):

```
> f = open("cr.yul", 'w')
> f.write("\r")
> f.close()
```

produces a crash

```
> ../build/solc/solc cr.yul --strict-assembly
Warning: Yul is still experimental. Please use the output with care.
Error: Expected keyword "object".
 --> cr.yul:1:2:
  |
1 | terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  basic_string_view::substr: __pos (which is 1) > __size (which is 0)
Aborted
```

On master, using AFL fuzzing of yul inputs via '--strict-assembly'.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer.

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.8.3-develop.2021.3.3+commit.ad2ecf16.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

@bshastry see my email, but I just started fuzzing the yul corpus via --strict-assembly, and will see what that turns up, whatever your answers!
