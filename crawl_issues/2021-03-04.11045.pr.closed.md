# [\#11045 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11045) `closed`: Ensure jsoncpp isn't installed with _static suffix

Trying to package this for Nixpkgs, the build kept failing because it assumed that `libjsoncpp.a` would be available, however, `libjsoncpp_static.a` was being created.

Hm, if I see it correctly, the ``STATIC_SUFFIX`` option was only introduced in json-cpp 1.9.4, so we'd probably also need to update the version for this to work, wouldn't we?

I'm a bit weary here, 1.9.4 adds it as a hot fix for every platform in json-cpp, but on current master of json-cpp it's then restricted again to only MSVC apparently... not quite sure what to make of it yet...

@jonringer Are you trying to package us with the hard-coded json-cpp 1.9.3 or are you trying to patch us to use json-cpp 1.9.4?

I mean, there is definitely no harm in merging this, but it'd be nice to understand where this is coming from in the first place.

Looks like someone added the `_static` suffix in 1.9.4 (https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/pull/1197) as a workaround for naming clash between the static and dynamic library on Windows. The fix affected all platforms though. Someone complained about it recently (https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/issues/1245) and changed it so that the suffix is now added only on Windows (https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/pull/1263) but that change is not a part of any release yet.

So basically, it's only 1.9.4 that's "broken". It's fine on 1.9.3 and earlier and it will be back to normal on 1.9.5. The question is - do we support arbitrary versions of jsoncpp or just 1.9.3? Because in the `jsoncpp.cmake` we have it hard-coded to download 1.9.3.

I also don't think there's much harm in adding it but it does cause an annoying warning on 1.9.3:
```
CMake Warning:
  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    STATIC_SUFFIX
```
The warning will go away when we upgrade so maybe that's not really a big deal.

But since this is just a temporary annoyance, maybe it would be better to just leave it as is? Can it be worked around by simply specifying `-DSTATIC_SUFFIX=` on the command line?

This would probably only work if were to pass all global options, but not sure if that's desired behavior, and would probably create more coupling.

Looks like I made a mistake and thought i was getting `1.9.3` but was actually getting `1.9.4` (the previous version was using this version of jsoncpp, but I wanted to match upstream (you all)) https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/d24ee9e6d585009731d1c50bda49724f43362fae/pkgs/development/compilers/solc/default.nix#L26

However, since the other projects in this repo assume that the `libjsoncpp${SUFFIX}` is missing the `_static`, maybe it would be worth to merge to help prevent against potential future breakages. Not sure what to do about windows.



> @jonringer Are you trying to package us with the hard-coded json-cpp 1.9.3 or are you trying to patch us to use json-cpp 1.9.4?

I intended to do 1.9.3 to match you all, the previous build had 1.9.4 for reasons I'm not sure. https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/4f9a414094c08e6dd682352528096a0364ae0901/pkgs/development/compilers/solc/default.nix#L15

I fixed the accidental version swap here: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/compare/d24ee9e6d585009731d1c50bda49724f43362fae..cad078aa872badd36b4b60fa669a0281a664fa99

Alright! So am I correct in that with this change the issue is actually resolved for now and we just need to keep this in mind if we want to update to json-cpp 1.9.4 ourselves?

That's worth a thought, but since json-cpp seems to be changing this behaviour again on their master branch, I'd tend to wait a bit first to see if they don't release again soon because of it.

Yea, this sounds correct. I can close this PR as I artificially created a different build environment.

I apologize for the noise :)
