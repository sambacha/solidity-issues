#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-03-04 09:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11046):

Inspired by
```
contract C {
   uint64[4] nums;
   function f() public { 
     nums[0] = 11111;
     nums[1] = 22222;
     nums[2] = 33333;
     nums[3] = 44444;
   }
}
```
Optimized assembly before this change:

```
      0x00
      dup1
      sload
      not(0xffffffffffffffff)
      and
      0x2b67
      or
      not(0xffffffffffffffff0000000000000000)
      and
      0x56ce0000000000000000
      or
      not(shl(0x80, 0xffffffffffffffff))
      and
      shl(0x80, 0x8235)
      or
      sub(shl(0xc0, 0x01), 0x01)
      and
      shl(0xc2, 0x2b67)
      or
      swap1
      sstore
```

Optimized assembly after this change:
```
      0xad9c000000000000823500000000000056ce0000000000002b67
      0x00
      sstore
```
(note that it eliminates not only tremendous amounts of code but also the `sload`)

Downside of this change: The rule itself increases code size.

Also some commend line test needs updating, in case you missed that!

It seems to make the command line tests worse: https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/9acf05c30a27fc06e8a9ae436c885c35

By the way: This is not optimized via yul because the functions are not inlined :(

I did not add the test into expression simplifier because this is not the point of the rule. Instead, I added a commandline test.
