Documentation for the panic code is missing.

I did remove panic in last commit, if we decide to do panic in case of truncation, I'll drop that commit.
But, after thinking more about it, I think truncation should actually happen in order to align to what was done for other types. For 0.9.0, we can think of adding panic in case of truncation happens and we can possibly think of not doing checks in `unchecked` block.

After discussion on gitter, I dropped last commit
One last open question is if I need to change panic code?

I think it is fine to use a new panic code. The main question is if we want to re-use the same panic code for any invalid conversion out of range, i.e. also for bytes5 -> bytes2 or uint256 -> uint16.

Random question: Do we have a test for conversion from storage bytes? Is it copied to memory first?

I added `fromStorage` function to every test I created. It doesn't get copied to memory first, it reads directly from storage.

I'm sorry, but I'm about to change my mind about the checks and the panic.
The issue is that a conversion uint16 -> uint8 is very different from a conversion bytes2 -> bytes1.

If you look at the numeric value of a uint conversion `uint8(uint16(257))`, only knowledge about the internal representation will help you to understand that it results in 1, and because of that, causing a panic for any out-of-range result is justifiable.

For `bytes2 -> bytes1`, this is very different. The only aspect that can be argued about is that you have to know whether truncation happens at the end or at the beginning.

In essence, truncation is a much more natural operation on a sequence of bytes than it is on integers. Because of that, I'm now leaning towards truncating and not causing a panic for any bytes -> bytesN conversion.

Decision from call: truncate now and use a more involved general conversion routine in the future.

PR is updated to truncate instead of panic.

Looks good apart from the documentation bits!
