Please try to parse the errors and display them nicely. If this is more than a day's work, then at least try to display the error signature instead of its hash and split the data by chunks of 0x20 bytes and format them as "unknown data".

@cameel Thanks for your review! I think I covered everything, except the actual parameter decoding. It should not be that complicated, but I will add this tomorrow.

OK. I'll take another look today. From what I've seen yesterday, most of the issues I found were cosmetic so this should be quick.

If the decoding turns out to be time-consuming, feel free to just skip it in this PR. It's just nice to have, not anything critical.

Reviewed again, including the older comments. All of those older ones seem solved or irrelevant. So the remaining things (apart from some minor tweaks) are:
- assert for number of parameters is probably wrong (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11050#discussion_r639878479)
- test for a conflict (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11050#discussion_r639913950)
- data decoding (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11050#discussion_r638740501) - optional, skip if needs time

@cameel I added a very simple parameter decoder. I tried to implement a more advanced decoder, but it would take more time to implement this completely. Right now it only uses the parameter types for indexed/nonIndexed events for simple `bool`'s. By default everything is just decoded as hex, but if the hex data consists of printable ascii characters, the parameter will be decoded as a string. For this none of the provided type information is used. Also the parameters are just decoded in 32 byte chunks. 

However, at least we have the parameter type information available, so if needed we could improve the decoding in another PR.

I just saw that `chk_spelling` fails, because the strings are split into 32 byte chunks. I think it should be easily possible to just merge multiple string literals.

Maybe just change the string in snark.sol, we can think about a better solution later.
