Was bought up in solidity gitter

```
library Lib {
    function foo(bytes32) internal pure returns (bytes32) {}
    function foo(bytes4) internal pure returns (bytes32) {}
}
```

Compiles correctly,

However

```
bytes4 b = 0x01020304;    
Lib.foo(b);
```

returns

```
Error: Member "foo" not unique after argument-dependent lookup in type(library Lib).
  --> <stdin>:10:10:
   |
10 | 		return Lib.foo(b);
   | 		       ^^^^^^^

````

I think because `bytes4` can be implicitly converted to `bytes32` making the resolution not unique.

On the other hand, it's probably impossible to make an internal call to `function foo(bytes4)`. External calls have to be made by manually using `.call` and manual encoding.

---

I think we should have an error during `checkDuplicateFunctions` if two functions have the same name and their arguments can be implicitly converted to each other.

The issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1256 proposes that the conversion should be allowed.

My arguments for disallowing it would be:
1. Calling such functions from the frontend becomes more complicated. For example, if there is `f(uint)` and `f(uint128)`, calling either of them from the front-end is not as straightforward as `contract.f(10)`. Even though frontends seem to have support for calling them [ether.js: overloaded functions](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/migration/web3/) and [web3.py: invoke ambigous functions](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contracts.html#invoke-ambiguous-contract-functions-example)
2. Allowing it would mean adding more rules to reference resolution.


On the other hand, we have the following issues if this is disallowed:
1. Unable to write interfaces to contracts that have already implemented this. Both existing solidity contracts, and contracts from other languages.
2. Perhaps this would affect templated functions. Say for templated function `f<T>(T val)`, this might mean that `f<uint>` and `f<uint128>` cannot coexist.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
