I think it needs a Changelog entry. Also can you add the original code that caused the first problem?

Will add changelog entry.
The example I am adding here is minimized version of the code from the issue.
I thought it is better to strip the unrelated part (the mapping) and focus on the root cause.
But if you still want the original example, I can add it as well.
