Actually, this PR was motivated by crashes reported by the fuzzer which turned out to be false positives. Although I'm reasonably confident that these should get rid of false positives encountered so far (and hopefully every other FP), in case something new comes up, I can quickly patch it in a small future PR.

For this reason, I feel merging this is okay if checks pass.
