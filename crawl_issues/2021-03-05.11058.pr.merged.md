# [\#11058 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11058) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix CHC cex order

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-03-05 15:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11058):

This bug was "always there". Internal function calls have predicates called `summary_X_...` and external function calls `nondet_call_X...`. When there are multiple calls on the same CFG block, we know the order of the calls in the cex graph by string sorting. If the numbers in `summary_X` and `summary_Y` have the same amount of digits it works well, but it can break when the number of digits is different: `summary_9` is actually greater than (string wise) `summary_10`, which is not the intended behavior. We still want to sort based on the number itself.
This PR fixes that by parsing the predicate name and extracting the number to compare properly.
