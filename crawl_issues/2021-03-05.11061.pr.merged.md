@bshastry This certainly doesn't hurt, but does the fuzzer actually generate external calls? If so how does it choose addresses, s.t. not basically all of them revert? Does the interpreter deal with them?

The fuzzer generates external calls. It does not have any logic to choose addresses i.e., no feedback from EVMHost which basically means they are virtually useless as things stand. The (yul) interpreter does not really deal with calls (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b4c08b9bfe5edfe1d140a95c08269ebb989dc619/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L304-L324).

By the way, one interesting side effect of the tracing addition in this PR (perhaps interesting is subjective) was the following "issue" found by the fuzzer

```
{
        function f(i) -> o1, o2, o3, o4
        {
                function g() -> og1, og2, og3, og4
                {
                        og1, og2, og3, og4 := f(delegatecall(0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0))
                }
                let u, v, x, y := g()
        }
        let g1, g2, g3, g4 := f(0)
}
```

The code above produces a different "trace" (as per this PR). This is because, the optimised code runs out of EVM stack (eventually throwing stack overflow error) much later than the unoptimised code. This means the former is able to make more "delegatecall"s than the unoptimised calls, and because each delegatecall is a single line in the trace, the optimised trace looks different :-)

You make a good point @ekpyron . Perhaps, we should feed in a list of valid addresses to the proto converter that may be used for call generation.

> Some comments, but generally, I'm fine with merging this (and sort out how best to make use of it in fuzzing afterwards).
> But I also wonder: since there are more and more of these tracing functions in the `EVMHost`:

Thanks, I now moved the "printing" code to a separate class.
