# [\#11069 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11069) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Use same sort name for array slice as for the underlying array

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-03-09 10:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11069):

This PR fixes the creation of SMT sort for expressions of type `ArraySlice`. Previously, the name of this sort was always `bytes_tuple` regardless of the type of the underlying array.
Now the name of the sort is the same as for an expression of type corresponding to the underlying array.

Fixes #11063.
Fixes #11064.
