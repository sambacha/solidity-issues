This, intentionally, doesn't try anything clever, but just drops it. In case things can be simplified on top of this, I'd suggest to do that separately.

Since this was a command line option, should it be a changelog entry? Or has it always be experimental, so no entry is fine? I don't think we had documentation for it and introducing it had no changelog entry either, if I see it correctly...

I think it's good to have a changelog entry.

Squashed and reformulated changelog entry slightly.

Ok, it probably was 615, but maybe also an outdated version of it.

Sorry, I just pushed again to change the changelog entry again (making it properly refer to the command line interface - that's the user-visible change this does anyways).

Rebased to solve changelog conflict.
