# [\#11073 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11073) `merged`: Extract StackReuseCodegen tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-03-09 14:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11073):

Does anyone see a better way to do this?
The problem is that we loose the comments and grouping of the opcodes that we had in the C++ file... is that worth keeping them there?
Should we instead print evmasm, not opcodes? Not sure why the StackReuseCodegen.cpp code didn't do that - that's enough for testing it, isn't it?
