**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

Another annoying Warning, that I started to get after upgrading to 0.8.x:

```
Warning: Visibility for constructor is ignored.
```

Which is cool in most cases, but I already have clean constructors. This warning is emitted when running `--combined-json ast,compact-format` and then `--import-ast`. And there is no easy way how to resolve this.

So I'll have to find a hack how to eat all warnings from solc using stderr redirect, until this resolves.

## Environment

```
solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.8.2+commit.661d1103.Darwin.appleclang
```

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc --combined-json ast,compact-format test.sol > out.json
$ solc --import-ast out.json

Warning: Visibility for constructor is ignored. If you want the contract to be non-deployable, making it "abstract" is sufficient.
--> test.sol

--> test.sol
```

Source of `test.sol`:

```

pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract Mortal {
    address owner;

    constructor() { owner = msg.sender; }

    function kill() public { if (msg.sender == owner) selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender)); }
}

contract Greeter is Mortal {
    string greeting;

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }
}
```
