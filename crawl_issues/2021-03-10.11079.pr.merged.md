# [\#11079 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11079) `merged`: AST import: constructors have default visibility

This avoids the warning about visibility being specified for constructors when the AST is imported.

Not sure how to write a test for this.

Thanks for the tip about `default`! Gonna patch my ASTs

I'd personally have gone for just ignoring it on the import instead, but I'm fine with keeping the export change. We should stop exporting this at all at the latest with 0.9 anyways - we could already do that on the breaking branch, s.t. we don't forget...

Seems like ignoring at import is preferred. I'll change this now.
