Came up during the second Solidity AMA: https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/solidity-team-ama-2-on-wed-10th-of-march-2021/152/7

Since, in general, we cannot reasonably extend calldata array slices to nested arrays (since we would need to store the base pointer making it three-stack-slot types, which would become excessive), this might be an alternative at least for "one-sided" slicing we could consider. It would be straightforward to implement, since the length of dynamic calldata arrays is just a value on the stack anyways.

Closing this. This can be implemented via inline assembly and generics.
