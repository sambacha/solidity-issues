This PR looks small so we could get it done. What's missing?

Marked as `takeover` and no activity, closing the PR. Code is still available in the branch if anyone wants to take over.

We decided to deprecate the gas meter anyway.

I think this is not related. Wasn't the decision to remove the gas estimator? This here practically is part of evmone and testing, and is useful to get accurate gas figures in the tests.

My bad. I must have misinterpreted it back then. I thought it was about handling precompiles in the meter but obviously not since this is about EVMHost.

So what's the state here? I guess I'll add back the ``takeover`` label?

No need, still trying to figure out, there's some memory corruption happening which is hard to debug.

For example here, that first 32-bits are overwritten by something and I can't figure it out. The fields are not overlapping. I was surmising maybe the `map<.., tuple<>>` construct is the problem.

@cameel @nikola-matic this should be easy enough to review/merge however
