<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

```
contract A {
    uint x;
    constructor() {
        x = 42;
    }
    function f() public returns(uint256) {
        return x;
    }
}
contract B is A {
    uint public y = f();
    function g() public returns(uint256) {
        return y;
    }
}
// ----
// constructor() ->
// y() -> 0
// g() -> 0
// f() -> 0x2a
```

passes but it should not. What should not pass is the `y() -> 0` and `g() -> 0` parts. They should both equal `0x2a`.

Funnily enough, this test reports correct results via yul i.e., new code gen. We already have a semantic test for it here (only for new code gen and ewasm) https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/constructor_inheritance_init_order.sol

## Environment

- Compiler version: 23f03e1b6
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Berlin
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: evm v0.4.0

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ isoltest -t test
```

This may actually be closed because it is documented behavior https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/ir/ir-breaking-changes.rst

Still since @ekpyron suggested that that page be made public, leaving this issue open for now.

Solved by #12258.
