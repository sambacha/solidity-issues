@leonardoalt , I think I have a more elegant fix for #10957 than the previous one.
Can you check it if you agree? I just changed how current scope contract is detected, taking the idea from `SMTEncoder::currentScopeContract`. If yes, I will squash this and add a changelog entry.

Ah nice, looks good indeed!

We could even remove the field `m_currentFunction` from `VariableUsage`. After this change, it will not be used anymore. Should we remove it or do you think it might still be useful? I would remove it, since we know that in some situations it might not hold the right value.

Yea true, I was thinking the same. Please remove it if possible.

I have just tested also #10926 and this PR fixes also that issue. I will add it to the regression tests.
