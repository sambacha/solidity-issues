# [\#11093 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11093) `closed`: [Yul Optimizer] Replace zero by returndatasize before calls.

This is mainly a toy optimizer step to check how complicated it gets to trace a property through the Yul AST that is changed at some random builtin function calls - but since I think it works now, it does save quite some gas actually.

Damn, our test suite can't handle the fact that this optimization step depends on the EVM version...
EDIT: I just disabled running the full optimizer suite tests and the unit tests for this step on old evm versions to fix this... not ideal, but probably not a huge issue...

I think this is a nice "hack", it goes in the direction of x86 optimisations ðŸ˜‰ 

One thing to keep in mind: there are some proposals to have [transaction packages](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2733), i.e. a chain of transactions as a single block. Such proposals state that returndata would be populated by the previous transaction (up until returndata is overwritten by something else).

So even if we set the evmversion, this would mean such proposal can't be introduced without account versioning. While I understand people can already use this trick, I don't think anyone is, but Solidity having this step will put a large set of users on the chain.

The second remark I have is how would this affect static analyzers? I think they should already track calls and any potential state, but still it may be nice to reach out to some projects.

And the last remark is readability of the source/IR. I think this change reduces readability. We should really add the #10475 and include real world examples to see actual gas change and not of those synthetic tests we have.

Yeah, fair points. As I wrote in the description, this mainly started as an exercise in seeing how complex doing such kind of analysis would be in the optimizer, because checking that memory operations are safe for the stack limit evader will involve something similar (only that's a bit more complicated, since the base property is more complex than just invalidating returndata). So I wouldn't be too unhappy with not doing this in the end - but it does pay out and I'll also expect it to keep paying out in real-world cases - not so much in runtime cost, since it's only one gas each time, but in code size and deploy cost, since I save an entire byte...

I wouldn't worry too much about static analyzers with this, but the EIP is an interesting point to consider indeed. Not sure the deploy time gas savings here are worth complicating stuff like that...

@axic just quickly skimmed through the EIP... do you think there is much reason to put a transaction in a transaction package that *doesn't* have specific support for it (and would proactively read the "returndata" from the last transaction)?
At a first glance it would seem to me that only after that EIP were to be merged new contracts would be developed that could be called as child transactions to other transactions, but that there's not too much value in chaining transactions of existing old contracts...
I don't really see why account versioning would be required for this in any case. In general you'd just have selected contracts as child transactions that, well, can serve as child transactions, so there is no harm in all kinds of old contracts breaking, if you call them as child transaction, since you can still just *not* call them *as* child transaction... or am I missing something there? I haven't spent that much time thinking about it and didn't read the EIP too carefully yet...

EDIT: turns out that batching existing contract calls that do produce non-empty returndata is likely desirable for the EIP, so this is indeed an issue to consider.

As a last point regarding your comments:
To me it would seem that gas cost generally always outweighs readability in Yul (which doesn't mean that readability isn't nice and shouldn't be broken carelessly - but I'd consider it a secondary goal and put efficiency first) - if we don't agree on that, maybe we should talk about it some time :-).

The last comment on https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2733-transaction-package/4365/10 seems to indicate that we might not have to puzzle our heads too much over that...

On a call with @chriseth our tendency was not to do this at least right now. I'll still keep it open for now and maybe we want to have another look at the gas savings - and it might also be interesting to have a quick look at the logic in the PR, because I think the process of defining a bad property, then propagating it from leafs in the call graph upwards (here done by the side effect propagator), and then visiting the AST forward propagating the property down calls (here done by the BreadthFirstSearch) while treating loops specially, is something we might need for memory analysis/optimization later - but generally I'm fine with closing this.

Just for the fun of it, even though we probably won't merge this as is anyways, this is the gas cost changes - which are often nice, but occasionally actually bad even (not sure whay that is):
