# [\#11094 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11094) `merged`: EVMHost: Use std::map for storage so that slots are stored in some order

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2021-03-12 08:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11094):

Motivation is the following:

- When testing old code gen vs new code gen, assertion was placed on storage of both code versions being equal
- Since EVMHost used unordered_map, although storage *contents* were equal, their order was not
- This led to false positives

This PR fixes that issue by simply using a map. I don't think a custom comparator is required but if reviewers think otherwise, it may be easily implemented.

@ekpyron Timed isoltest on semantic tests with and without this change and it turns to be roughly the same, give or take a couple of seconds. Caveat: Single run only. Time not averaged over several runs.

Yeah, should still be fine, if there was any major regression, it should have shown up and I don't expect any.
