Thanks to @jiangshangqifeng for reporting on gitter.

This resulted in
```
solidity/test/libsolidity/analysis/FunctionCallGraph.cpp: In function ‘std::ostream& {anonymous}::operator<<(std::ostream&, const EdgeNames&)’:
/solidity/test/libsolidity/analysis/FunctionCallGraph.cpp:176:77: error: cannot deduce template arguments for ‘less’ from ()
  for (auto const& edge: _edgeNames | to<vector>() | actions::sort(std::less()))
                                                                             ^

```

But since ``_edgeNames`` is a ``std::set`` anyways, there's no need to convert it to a vector or explicitly sort it again, so we can simplify this and fix that compilation error at the same time.

We should, however, add a CI run for debian buster to prevent us falling out of sync with gcc 8, since ubuntu focal already ships gcc 9. And supporting debian stable seems like quite a reasonable compatibility requirement for us to keep.
