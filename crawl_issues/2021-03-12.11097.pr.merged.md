# [\#11097 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11097) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Reset reference variables on assignment to a variable of reference type

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-03-12 18:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11097):

Resolves #10847.

This is the second PR regarding handling of assignment in SMTChecker.
Previously, on an assignment to a reference variable, the knowledge about variables potentially aliasing the variable being assigned was not reset. This could lead to false negative as witnessed by #10847.

Unfortunately, this change introduces more false positives, as witneseds by the changed test. However, false positives are more acceptable than false negatives.

I plan to address the introduced false positive with the next PR in the series.
