I was fed up with the lack of this, but noticed @chriseth's trick after doing this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10612#issuecomment-745372153.

You *could* just pipe `yes` through it... or `yes 'u'`...

Yea that's also what I do

I do it like that as well, but would be nice to add this feature anyway

I'd argue: why complicate our code and add features that aren't really needed, since there's simple alternatives...
On the other hand, I'm not sure if there's a readily available "yes" in osx or especially on windows... not sure if we care too much...

But yeah, fine with adding it nonetheless.

Ah, right, I only now realize that I just repeated that trick that's already mentioned in the description...

Yes I agree this feature is not strictly needed, but it is a nice convenience feature.

Unless there is strong opposition, I would vote for merging. If merging, is there some consensus on `--accept-updates` as a name?
