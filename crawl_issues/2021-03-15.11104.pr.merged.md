# [\#11104 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11104) `merged`: Add missing header to Algorithms.h.

Should fix https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11103, although I'm not sure why our CI wouldn't catch that... I wonder whether that's a built against the ubuntu bionic STL instead of the gcc-10 one - also not sure where that gcc package in the issue is coming from. Anyways, the header should be there.
