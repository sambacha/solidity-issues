# [\#11105 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11105) `closed`: Path resolution docs + proposed changes (path spec v1)

Related to #11036 and PR #9353.
Also related to a bunch of smaller bug reports/feature requests related to paths: #9346, #2738, #4702, #5146, #11042, #11039, #11038, #10980, #4623, #5281.

This PR is an attempt to explain how I think the compiler is currently **supposed to** handle paths used in imports, on the command line, in Standard JSON, on the standard input, etc. This means that it does not really reflect how it all works now. I ignored known bugs and introduced some changes to make it match my expectations better and I'm going point out the differences in review comments. This is meant as a starting point for discussion and I think it should be merged into the docs once we agree whether the changes I'm proposing make sense and we implement them.

The docs ended up being pretty long. All the available features and abstractions make this surprisingly complex and produce many weird corner cases, though after working through it systematically many things I considered bugs while reporting #11036 suddenly appear to make sense. They definitely do not seem as such when you first encounter them so unfortunately I think that a long explanation is necessary if we expect users to understand how it all works.

I introduced some new terminology in the PR (import keys, import paths, virtual filesystem, imports relative to base/source) which might be a bit controversial (I'm open to renaming them) but expanding the vocabulary is badly needed here to be able to refer to things without being ambiguous or having to clarify terms with a full sentence every time they appear.

We discussed import paths with @chriseth today. I posted a summary on the channel but I'm pasting it here as well because it's related:

- Should absolute imports (i.e. `import "/a/b/c.sol"`) be affected by `--base-path`? Currently this will import `/project/a/b/c.sol` if you use `--base-path /project`.
    - We expect people to keep stuff in a single base directory so this is by design. Paths in imports are not meant to be seen as filesystem paths.
    - I think that such imports are seen by users as absolute in the underlying filesystem anyway. Having base path affect absolute imports is unexpected and confuses them.
- Currently import remappings have the form `context:prefix=target`. We agree that the `context` part is not very useful in practice and we could remove it to simplify the whole system.
    - `context` was meant to let users apply remappings selectively but this did not turn out to be a common use case.
- We discussed making bigger (and potentially breaking) changes in how imports and remappings work to make them simpler and more intuitive:
    - We could move import remapping from `CompilerStack` (where it is applied when import paths are converted to internal source unit IDs) to file loader (where it would be performed on source unit IDs that are converted to actual filesystem paths). This way remappings would no longer be part of metadata.
        - I think this is a good idea but we should also drop current remappings. Having both would make already complex system even more complex.
        - This would also force JS tools using the compiler to handle remappings on their own in the callback (currently they can rely on compiler doing that).
    - We should forbid imports relative to the source file that go a level up in the hierarchy (i.e. imports starting with `../`). We already disourage using them.
    - We could allow only imports that do **not** start with `/`, `./` or `../` and then require the first directory on the path to be explicitly remapped if it is not located inside the base directory.
        - We discussed several other variations of this and couldn't really agree on the specifics and which one would work best so this needs more brainstorming.
    - I suggested that we could require top-level directories in relative imports have to start with `@` (and be remapped).
        - It is a nice convention but it should stay just that. We don't want to orce everyone to change their imports to that.
        - There was a concern about about a library forcing the user to use the same `@dir` that it uses internally. I'm not sure I completely understood why this is a problem.
- Path normalization
    - We should require import paths to be normalized. So no duplicate slashes, no `../` segments in the middle of the path, etc.
    - Not having them normalized means that it's pretty easy to import stuff in a way that seems interchangeable to the user but isn't and results in files being compiled twice (or not compiling at all due to name clashes).
    - We might also be ok with just normalizing them automatically since we already do that for imports starting with `./` and `../`.
    - One problem with normalization is that we want to allow using URLs as imports (with the intention of having them remapped to actual paths). Normalizing everything would replace the `://` with `:/`.
        - I think we should just make URLs a special case. If the import starts with `something://`, then the import path would not be normalized at all. Otherwise it would be normalized as a whole.
        - I did not mention it then but I think that `file://` would have to be another special case. The path after it should be normalized.
- We agreed that path being relative/absolute on the command line should not affect whether the compiler sees it as relative or absolute. It should depend on whether the file is inside the base path(s) or not.

I have just pushed some minimal changes: fixes for some of the comments, renaming of "source unit ID" to "source unit name" and small tweaks I made while working on #11263. None of it changes the text substantially. This is only to keep it clean in case I need to get back to it.

I'm closing this PR in favor of #11263. The text has changed a lot so I have decided to create a new PR and keep this one for reference. Also, the goal of the PR has changed - the new one only documents the existing situation without any proposed modifications.
