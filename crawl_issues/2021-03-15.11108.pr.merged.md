# [\#11108 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11108) `merged`: Remove remains of shellcheck ignore list

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-03-15 19:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11108):

Looks like the change that actually removes the list disappeared from #10879, probably during one of the rebases.

The list is unused anyway because I removed the part of the script that used it but the file is superfluous.
