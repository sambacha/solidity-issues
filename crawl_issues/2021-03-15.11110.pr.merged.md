Oha, I guess we also want to prevent running the style & spell-checker on external sources.

Do we really need all these files from openzeppelin, I am mostly thinking about docs?

In case the comment way up there might get lost otherwise, I leave this as big fat comment here once more: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11229 contains more proper antlr grammar fixes that are already completely compatible with this PR, so just undoing all antlr changes here and rebasing on that should fix all grammar-related issues.

EDIT #11229 is now merged, so this here will need a rebase.

Can you also add a semantic test that uses one of the external sources from OZ?
For example inherit from `Ownable`?

@mijovic I added already a semantic test for this: e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11110/commits/9345590866753bc81677411d9ef07a33eeef76fe#diff-a96982cc40d35ca4241edc0e55b4619591f70059538462f8fa9c3c043b179af1, or what do you mean?

Ah, sorry, somehow lost it in list of files. I kind of seen it when did a first review.

@aarlt Not sure if this was already discussed (can't find any mention in the comments here) but do we really want to dump all the OZ files directly into the repo? Why not use a git submodule?

Alternatively, we already maintain a clone of the OZ repo in https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/openzeppelin-contracts. Maybe you could just check it out in CI before running the test?

I'd suggest not to import openzeppelin in this PR. And when we do import openzeppelin partially or completely, the commit should say what exact version we're are importing, and the actual semantic tests should make good use of all that code we import.

I just noticed that updating expectations using isoltest is not working. Basically the source gets fully rewritten, where external sources get directly written into updated source.

One more thing. I think we should be creating `CompilerStack` in tests without file reader callback (or an empty one that just returns an error. The logic in the default file reader is only suited for command-line usage. It will end up importing the wrong files in tests. If we disable it, we will get much more predictable behavior because only compiler's virtual filesystem will be used.

I think we use right now an "empty" reader callback for the tests.

`explicit CompilerStack(ReadCallback::Callback _readFile = ReadCallback::Callback());`.

@cameel thx a lot for your detailed review! I removed the parser part - it is really not needed, because `ExternalSource` could be used to import the files manually. I just added a commit that reflects your last review. I was not yet able to implement all of the tests that you mentioned, so far only 1) relative imports in external sources.

However, additionally to the things you mentioned in your review, I implemented now the correct logic for updating expectations that are used in tests using external sources. I would continue implementing the other tests tomorrow.

Right. But only if you're not passing any arguments to `CallStack` constructor. I that the case?

Yes, looks like. `SolidityExecutionFramework` just default constructs `solidity::frontend::CompilerStack`.

I didn't review it, it's our own code, so easy to change later on.
