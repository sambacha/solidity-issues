this interface is also used in the LSP PR #8125 (splitout, and now more....):

/cc @cameel (what did you want to work on here?)

- Adds FileReader: extracted from CommandLineInterface, to share the logic between CLI and LSP.
- Adds FileRemapper: extracted from CompilerStack

I'm refactoring the path transformation logic and moving it into a single place to be able to easily add unit tests and fix bugs in it. Lately I've been actually spending more time just trying to understand the whole path logic, which is suprisingly complex given how little code it contains. I have documented my current understanding in #11105.

Some of changes overlap with yours (moving the logic out of `CommandLineInterface`), though I did not extract the reader itself. I created `PathResolver` responsible for path mapping, base path, allowed paths, etc. and moved logic from both `CommandLineInterface` and `CompilerStack` there. My current plan is to drop the part that overlaps with your changes and just build on top of what you're doing here once we get your PR merged.

Without wanting to complicate this PR too much, I think the problems raised and trying to be solved in #9353 should be addressed here. And I think by trying to document what exactly this class is doing, would lead to a better understanding and design, ultimately fixing the problems identified by #9353 :wink:

Are there any tests in codebase that are testing this?
