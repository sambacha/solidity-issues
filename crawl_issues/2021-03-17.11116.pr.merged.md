# [\#11116 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11116) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Handle InaccessibleDynamicType

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-03-17 08:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11116):

This PR makes SMTChecker aware of `InaccessibleDynamic` type which was part of the type of a return value from external call on older EVM versions (up to spuriousDragon) if dynamically encoded data were to be returned.

This was causing a sort mismatch when SMTChecker was trying to create an SMT representation of the function call expression.

Fixes #10985.

@blishko can you rebase this now that the other PR was merged?
