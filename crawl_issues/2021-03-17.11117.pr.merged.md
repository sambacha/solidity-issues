# [\#11117 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11117) `merged`: Fix small bug in GasMeter calculation in creation context

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13174375?u=52d702cb6bec53b561afa293cf9cd53ef7a63924&v=4" width="50">[hrkrshnn](https://github.com/hrkrshnn) opened issue at [2021-03-17 10:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11117):

Old calculation did not ignore `optimize-runs` parameter, when creation code gas computations were
done. This would lead to expanding values such as `shl(180, 1)` inside constructor code, even for
the default value for `--optimize-runs`, i.e., 200.

Does it need a changelog? Would it only affect IR generation?

`--asm` doesn't have the same issue.

Or actually maybe not? Can you check that this works as expected when optimizing ABIv2 when used in construction context wrt. when used in deployed code?
