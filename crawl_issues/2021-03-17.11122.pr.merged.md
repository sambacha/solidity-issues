So far this PR adds the extra predicate and rules, but does not output local variables yet.

Good example!
I think that should be possible, although not so easy. Expressions are not scopable in the AST afaik, so I'm not sure how we can collect only the VariableDeclarations in the same scope as the verification target.
@chriseth any idea?

As far as I know, the scopes only exist during the "reference resolution" step. It might be good to keep them alive for longer, I wanted to have that feature for other use-cases, too.

@chriseth wouldn't it work simply by making `Expression: Scopable` and relying on `Scoper`?

Oh wait, right! Expressions are not Scopable, but the declarations of the variables are. Just store the current scope (whenever you visit something that derives from Scope) and check if the annotation().scope of the declaration of the variable is in the stack of current scopes.

Ah, right! That works

Added the fix: keep track of a stack of scopes, by pushing every ScopeOpener node, and when a Predicate is created, copy the current scope stack. During cex generation, only report local variables whose scope is in the stack.

In the latest commit you can see that many of those were fixed from the first commit, including try/catch clauses, branches, modifiers, etc, so I didn't add new tests.
