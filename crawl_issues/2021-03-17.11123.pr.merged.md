Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10869

This seems to work end-to-end.
Needs:
 - [x] tests
 - [x] figure out how the argument can be conveniently encoded in hex instead of a regular ascii string.

We might need to make the side-effects a bit worse, by the way: This could use msize and so on.

I think Changelog item should be added.
If `verbatim` can be used in inline assembly block, we should add such test.
Also, can we add some simple semantic test with inline assembly, of course with opcodes known to evm?

Added chaneglog entry and a test that it does not work inside inline assembly.

Only update to documentation is needed, so the tests can pass.
The rest looks good, all other suggestions from previous reviews were applied.

It seems the `msize` detection is not working (see the commandline test)

Made `verbatim*` reserved and disallowed leading zeros for the regular verbatim functions.

Answering to "empty literal" - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11123#discussion_r615974607 :
You can achieve zero input and zero output also with a non-empty bytecode. Maybe I did not understand the question.

Zero input and zero output is fine. But an empty literal inserts no bytecode so what can it be used for?

I think it is clearer to have zero restrictions on the literal than an arbitrary one based on assumptions we cannot make because we do not know the target machine. Zero literal can be useful because it clears the optimizer's knowledge about storage.

I think going down this path (people using `verbatim("")` to control the optimizer) may not be a good idea.

Sure, most uses of verbatim may not be good ideas, but I don't think we should put arbitrary restrictions there. Especially since you can get almost the same by using `verbatim_1i_0o(hex"50", 0)` (0x50 is "pop")

And I'm fine with that, it shows a more conscious effort of using it :)

Maybe it is only me who finds `verbatim_0i_0o("")` as a bad idea, the restriction can always be lifted if it turns out to be useful.

Btw with all these challenges regarding the optimizer, I start to think that perhaps verbatim as-is is not the best ultimate solution, but rather something where effects can be declared properly is what we need eventually.

Re-checked the EVMASM optimizer:
 - Inliner is unaffected since it ignores all blocks that `breaksCSEAnalysisBlock`.
 - Jumpdest remover is unaffected since it removes unreferenced jumpdests, but verbatim is not supposed to jump to an actual jumpdest
 - peephole optimizer is unaffected. It might remove the verbatim if it is unreachable, documented that.
 - block deduplicator can combine identical verbatim bytecode blocks. Documented that.
 - CSE splits at verbatim blocks and thus is unaffected.
 - Constant Optimizer is unaffected.

The problem is https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/verbatimdata/libyul/optimiser/Semantics.cpp#L139. Not sure why it should get to that branch. Also don't have a direct example that throws. (Turns out that `m_objectAccess` is false and `m_dialect->builtin("verbatim_...")` returns `nullptr`. Maybe only an issue during testing?)
