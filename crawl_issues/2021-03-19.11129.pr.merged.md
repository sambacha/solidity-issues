# [\#11129 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11129) `merged`: Run SMTChecker tests for all EVM versions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-03-19 16:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11129):

The aim of this PR is to test if we can run SMTChecker tests for more than one version of EVM; if it will not have negative effect on test time.

Your change only makes it possible for one thread to pick up the smt checker step along with other steps (the constuction you removed was just making it run alone). It does not make it run with on other EVM versions.

You need to remove the run with `BOOST_TEST_ARGS="-t smtCheckerTests/*"` and then also remove the `nooptions` label from SMT tests in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.2/test/InteractiveTests.h#L68 so that the loop no longer skips them.

If you do that you should also decrease `2` to `1` in `STEPS=$(( 2 + ${#EVM_VALUES[@]} * ${#OPTIMIZE_VALUES[@]} ))` so that it properly reflects the number of steps to run.

Looks like it's ok in terms of running time. It took 49 min which is on par with recent successful workflows (I see times ranging from 45 to 52 minutes).

@leonardoalt , @cameel , I have remove the special first step completely and changed the loop so that SMTChecker tests are run only for `OPTIMIZE == 0`.

Sorry @cameel , I wanted to test something locally, and I realized I am running SMT Checker tests for OPTIMIZE=1 and not OPTIMIZE=0, I will fix that soon.

Sure, no problem!

You're right, the condition should be reversed. I missed that too. Too many negations :)

@cameel , @leonardoalt , now this one should be finally ready :)
