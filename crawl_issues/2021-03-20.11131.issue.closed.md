- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

The following test does not revert when run on an EVM client after it has been optimised by the legacy optimiser (i.e., `solc --optimize test.sol`).

```solidity
contract C {
  uint[] data;

  function val() public {
    assembly {
        sstore(0, 2)
        mstore(0, 0)
        sstore(keccak256(0, 32), 234)
        sstore(add(keccak256(0, 23), 1), 123)
    }
    assert(data[1] == 123);
  }
}
```

The following assembly code is produced (only relevant snippet has been pasted)

```
...
      0x02
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":85:86  0 */
      0x00
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":78:90  sstore(0, 2) */
      swap1
      dup2
      sstore
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":99:111  mstore(0, 0) */
      dup1
      mstore
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":145:148  234 */
      0xea
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":127:143  keccak256(0, 32) */
      0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e563
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":120:149  sstore(keccak256(0, 32), 234) */
      sstore
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":189:192  123 */
      0x7b
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":165:187  add(keccak256(0,23),1) */
      0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e564
        /* "test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol":158:193  sstore(add(keccak256(0,23),1), 123) */
      sstore
```

The values of interest are `0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e563` (`keccak256(0, 32)`) and `0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e564` (`add(keccak256(0, 23), 1)`).

The bug is that the legacy optimiser "pre-computes" `keccak256(0, 23)` to be somehow equal to `keccak256(0, 32)` which is incorrect. Although the value at memory location is zero, `keccak256(0, 32) = 0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e563` but `keccak256(0, 23) = 0xe2b9f9f9430b05bfa9a3abd3bac9a181434d23a707ef1cde8bd25d30203538d8`.

Because of the incorrect code, it turns out that `data[1] == 123` although the assembly operation `sstore(add(keccak256(0, 23), 1), 123)` is actually storing the value `123` to some unrelated storage slot.

Please note that the old code generator *without* optimisation enabled produces correct result (failing assertion because both the keccaks are not precomputed). The same holds true for new code gen with or without optimisation enabled.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 6e1d61a23
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): NA

## Steps to Reproduce

- Copy paste test into Remix, compile with optimisation enabled (defaulting to 200 runs)
- Deploy and run `val()`
- Expected result: Run should fail
- Actual result: Run succeeds

At first glance, it looks like this may be the root cause (HT @hrkrshnn )
 https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/6e1d61a232369e18b5d502f60ebd84ff83973237/libevmasm/KnownState.cpp#L381-L390

It looks like loadFromMemory always works at 32-byte granularity, so the fact that we are actually doing a sub-32-byte-word keccak is not taken into consideration. Anyway, good to get a quick ack, thanks once again for the pointer hrkrshnn

Hi , how to fix it ?
