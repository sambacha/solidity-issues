Thanks for the link change! If I remember correctly, there was more information on the old page. I'm wondering if that can still be found somewhere...

Old page: https://web.archive.org/web/20170312140408/https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver

Maybe we should link here? https://github.com/npm/node-semver/blob/master/README.md

I don't think we support the whole range of version specifiers provided by npm. For example `~1.2.3`, `1.2.*`, `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` or even crazy stuff like  `>=1.2.3 <1.(2+1).0`.

I think we would be better off just describing our (much smaller) subset of that syntax.

Anyway, that would be a separate issue.

Regarding just the link, looks like the old page is still available here: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver

To be fair we support a fairly large ruleset we should not support :wink:

I do agree we'd be better off describing ours and linking to upstream as inspiration.

Thanks! Yeah, I think it makes sense, the latest version doc is not very detailed like the old one. Updated as suggestion.

@Hongbo-Miao Could you also rebase on the current `develop`? There was an issue with windows build and it's fixed in `develop` but CI checks here won't pass until you rebase.
