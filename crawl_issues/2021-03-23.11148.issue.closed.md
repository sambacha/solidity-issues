## Description

This Yul file:

```
{
    let a   let addr := loadimmutable("address")
}
```

produces a crash when compiled _without_ optimization (no crash with `--optimize`:

```
root@19457c8b49c4:~/solidity/test# ../build/solc/solc s.yul --strict-assembly
Warning: Yul is still experimental. Please use the output with care.

======= s.yul (EVM) =======

Pretty printed source:
object "object" {
    code {
        let a
        let addr := loadimmutable("address")
    }
}

Exception while assembling: /solidity/libyul/AssemblyStack.cpp(233): Throw in function std::pair<MachineAssemblyObject, MachineAssemblyObject> solidity::yul::AssemblyStack::assembleWithDeployed(optional<std::string_view>) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Leftover immutables.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Leftover immutables.
```

On master, using AFL fuzzing of yul inputs via '--strict-assembly'.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer.

From the commit below because latest pull won't compile for me:

any guess what's going on there?

## Environment

- Compiler version:  Version: 0.8.3-develop.2021.3.9+commit.ad5d34df.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

Thank you for reporting the issue!

It looks like `loadimmutable`s need to be consumed. It looks like the reported ICE happens when assembling this syntax test: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libyul/yulSyntaxTests/loadimmutable.yul

I think it is unlikely that such a stray `loadimmutable` is generated by the Sol->Yul generator but I'm no expert here so CCing @chriseth

Thank you, we are aware of this issue and are working on a fix at the moment.

Oh good, it's not just me (which is always misery :) )

This error happens when you do not set the immutable before you load it. I'm not sure we can easily detect this purely at the yul syntax level.

At the minimum we could improve the message as it is not clear what it means. Also I listed a potential solution in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11174#issuecomment-843455476

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
