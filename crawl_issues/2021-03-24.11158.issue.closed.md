# [\#11158 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11158) `closed`: Natspec: include events/errors in devdoc too

This was asked in an old issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1141#issuecomment-801219827. Apparently we only include events in the userdoc, but not the devdoc.

```
contract C {
  /// @dev aa
  /// @param a aa
  /// @notice hello
  event A(uint a);
}
```

```
Developer Documentation
{
  "events":
  {
    "A(uint256)":
    {
      "details": "aa",
      "params":
      {
        "a": "aa"
      }
    }
  },
  "kind": "dev",
  "methods": {},
  "version": 1
}
```

This already works, but the `@notice` tag is not included. That is tracked in #11156.
