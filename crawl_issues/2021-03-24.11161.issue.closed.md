## Description

```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
  function f() public { abi.encode(); }
}
```

throws

```
solc: /usr/local/include/z3++.h:1835: z3::expr z3::cast_ast<z3::expr>::operator()(z3::context &, Z3_ast): Assertion `Z3_get_ast_kind(c, a) == Z3_NUMERAL_AST || Z3_get_ast_kind(c, a) == Z3_APP_AST || Z3_get_ast_kind(c, a) == Z3_QUANTIFIER_AST || Z3_get_ast_kind(c, a) == Z3_VAR_AST' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

during compilation `solc test.sol`

Not sure if we should report this upstream instead.

Perhaps this has to do with the Z3 installed on my laptop (`4.4.0`)

Happens for me on 4.8.9 too.

That shouldn't even compile though

Why not?

```
Warning: Statement has no effect.

```

I guess one could argue we should restrict this at some point?

I mean the compiler won't compile with z3 4.4.0.
And the dynamic linking should fail if it's not 4.8.X

I do get the same crash with 4.8.9, so whether 4.4.0 should work or not, this problem still exists.

Sure, I'm just still wondering how it also happened with 4.4.0.

I think I'm wrong. Let me check again. What is the preferred way of checking which z3 library, the solc binary links against? `ldd solc`?

I got a crash on this example also with Z3 4.8.10.

@bshastry yep `ldd` should work

`abi.encodePacked()` crashes too. `abi.encodeWithSelector(0)`/`abi.encodeWithSignature("")` does not.
