grep's `-o` and `-P` are GNU extensions and do not work on macOS.

@mijovic @aarlt Looks like the problem is simply the `\+`. For some reason BSD `sed` does not like it. Well, I should have used the `-E` mode which in my experience works more reliably between macOS and Linux.

Anyway, it's good that it happened because it made me realize that `sed`, unlike `grep` does not return an error if there are zero or more than one matches. I have now pushed a version with a sanity check. First I want to make sure it fails on macOS (because it still has the wrong regex). After that I'll push a change that updates the regex to:
```bash
sed -n -E -e 's/^\s*set\(PROJECT_VERSION "([0-9.]+)"\)\s*$/\1/p'
```

Ah, I just realized it won't fail in the CI because `cmdlineTests.sh` does not call it (yet). Pushing the final version in that case.

I rebased the PR that uses get-version on top of this one and it works fine now.
So, I am approving this now as it looks good
