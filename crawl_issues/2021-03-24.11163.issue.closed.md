## Description

This Yul file:

```
{
    function f() -> v {
        let a1 := calldataload(mul(1,4))
        let a2 := calldataload(mul(2,4))
        let a3 := calldataload(mul(3,4))
        let a4 := calldataload(mul(4,4))
        let a5 := calldataload(mul(5,4))
        let a6 := calldataload(mul(6,4))
        let a7 := calldataload(mul(7,4))
        let a8 := calldataload(mul(8,4))
        let a9 := calldataload(mul(9,4))
        let a10 := calldataload(mul(10,4))
        let a11 := calldataload(mul(11,4))
        let a12 := calldataload(mul(12,4))
        let a13 := calldataload(mul(13,4))
        let a14 := calldataload(mul(14,4))
        let a15 := calldataload(mul(15,4))
        let a16 := calldataload(mul(16,4))
        let a17 := calldataload(mul(17,4))
        sstore(mul(1,4), a1)
    }
}
```

produces a crash when compiled _without_ optimization (no crash with `--optimize`):

Exception while assembling: /solidity/libyul/backends/evm/EVMObjectCompiler.cpp(67): Throw in function void solidity::yul::EVMObjectCompiler::run(solidity::yul::Object &, bool)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::StackTooDeepError>

```

Not sure really relevant, since it's a stack overflow, and maybe the internals guard against this structure, but not sure it isn't.

On master, using AFL fuzzing of yul inputs via '--strict-assembly'.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer.

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.8.4-develop.2021.3.24+commit.6eac77ae.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

```

mstore(lt(or(gt(_13_71, or(or(gt(or(or(or(gt(or(gt(_105, _32_81), _13_71), _30_80), lt(or(_13_71, add(_25_76, _13_71)), _105)), _22_75), _13_71), _13_71), _104), _13_71)), _13_71), _13_71), _13_71)    }
    function foo_singlereturn_1() {
    }
}
```

is another structure that fails assembly the same way

It is not a bug per se, but a limitation. We have some pending changes to improve both the codegen and the optimiser to do better stack allocation/management, but it is still outstanding.

For most cases `solidity::yul::StackTooDeepError` would mean just a need for those improvements, however it can not be ruled out that in some rare cases it happens for a compiler bug.

Similarly:

```
{
    let a, b := f(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 95, 16, 17, 18)function f(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8, x9, x10, x11, x12, x13, x14, x15, x16, x17, x18) -> y, z
{
   y := mload(x3)
   z := mload(x7)
}
}
```

yields:

```
Exception while assembling: /solidity/libyul/backends/evm/EVMObjectCompiler.cpp(67): Throw in function void solidity::yul::EVMObjectCompiler::run(solidity::yul::Object &, bool)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::StackTooDeepError>
std::exception::what: The function f has 4 parameters or return variables too many to fit the stack size.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = The function f has 4 parameters or return variables too many to fit the stack size.
```

I'm assuming these should all be ignored, but wanted to confirm before adding a triage check that just throws stack problems in assembly away.

@axic do you think I should prune them for now?  A lot of these show up, all found via some yul compiling with --optimize and failing without --optimize, because optimization throws away the stack-breaking part.

Perhaps it is better to do some runs now with pruning these. If nothing shows up after a few days, perhaps better to go back to see if it catches some unexpected bug?

yeah, there are in practice right now too many to probably be fun to prune on your end or mine.  maybe once some limits are relaxed, and they become less common, turn off?  I'm re-running the check with a prune on this to see if anything else pops out.

For more complex cases you could try the [Yul object format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/yul.html#specification-of-yul-object):
```
$ solc/solc --yul yulobj.yul

Pretty printed source:
object "A" {
    code { let x := add(1, 2) }
    object "B" {

        data "@meta" hex"0011"
    }

}
```

The IR outputs code in this format, so it would be interesting to catch any issues. A basic set of training input can be found at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libyul/objectCompiler

I'm using exactly those as my initial corpus.  I think `--strict-assembly` is the way to go, no `--yul`, right?  --yul seems to fail on object format files --strict-assembly works for, such as the example you pointed to: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/yul.html#specification-of-yul-object

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
