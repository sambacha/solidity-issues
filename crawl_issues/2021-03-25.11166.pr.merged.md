# [\#11166 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11166) `merged`: Make command line tests to be able to run on unreleased version

Examples from documentation are run on current build, and unreleased version is strictly less than currentVersion.
This searches for `pragma solidity ^$developmentVersion` or `pragma solidity >=$developmentVersion` and replaces it with `pragma solidity >0.0.1`

Depends on #11162 to be merged because OSX_cli will fail without it. Locally I worked with updates from that PR

I rebased on top of #11162 and changed target branch here, so we get confirmation from CI that everything works as expected now.
Locally it was fine

@cameel I clicked your suggestion and after that I did squash which dismissed your review
