# [\#11167 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11167) `merged`: Show proper error for misusing the custom natspec tag

I think this is the real solution to #11152.

Made it two commits so the original error is easy to see, but it can be squashed prior to merge.

@hrkrshnn it is just an error reporting change, do we need it? I'm fine to add it.

Any suggestions for the error message? Does it look confusing that the `.` is part of the tag?
