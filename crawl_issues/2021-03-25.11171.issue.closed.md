# [\#11171 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11171) `closed`: Add new natspec tags to pygments-lexer-solidity
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

https://github.com/veox/pygments-lexer-solidity is used by our documentation for syntax highlighting. @veox the repository does not have issues enabled, so opening this here.

`@inheritdoc` and `@custom:..` is not highlighted.

That's because the repo is actually on gitlab:

Regex `custom:[a-zA-Z_]\w*` should be fine for the `@custom:..`, right?..

Ah, from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ecf7f21d55f72a567e5a3f9cd89610f5ea67f564/docs/natspec-format.rst:

> Custom tags start with `@custom:` and can contain lowercase characters and hyphens following that.

It is actually `@custom:[a-z][a-z-]*`. The documentation is being updated in #11170.

We may want to update keywords too. Should I submit a PR?

It seems at least the following could be added:
- `bytes.concat`
- `pragma abicoder`
- `catch Panic([^)])`
- `unchecked`

I've not gone through the release notes since Solidity v0.6, says the README file.

A PR (MR on gitlab) is great, sure.

The NatSpec I've just done, BTW.

https://pypi.org/project/pygments-lexer-solidity/0.6/

v0.6 has been pushed to PyPI with the two new NatSpec keywords.

@veox thanks! Just pushed the keyword changes: https://gitlab.com/veox/pygments-lexer-solidity/-/merge_requests/5

And also the SPDX identifier, I'm not sure this should be merged or not: https://gitlab.com/veox/pygments-lexer-solidity/-/merge_requests/6

The compiler uses it in a special way, hence highlighting it may be useful.

Then definitely worth inclusion.

Merged both, released as v0.7:

https://pypi.org/project/pygments-lexer-solidity/0.7.0/

Thanks! I'll create a PR updating our docs now.
