I get this for `struct hex { uint a; }`:
```
Error: Expected identifier but got 'ILLEGAL'
 --> hex_as_identifier.sol:1:8:
  |
1 | struct hex { uint a; }
  |    
```

I.e. it does not even work in Solidity.

The same happens for `hex` in inline assembly before this PR, so it is not breaking.

Yeah, I wouldn't have expected it to work in Solidity, but I'm a bit surprised that it didn't work in Inline Assembly / Yul - I would have expected it to work ever since we split out ``TokenTraits::isYulKeyword`` - but it so happens that both: hex and hex strings were already marked as yul keywords and the parser parses them as "illegal" token instead anyways, probably because it always expects a hex string, so good!

@ekpyron @hrkrshnn ok, I think this should do it now.

It seems we need the hex keyword in yul.
