# [\#11177 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11177) `merged`: Update pygments-lexer-solidity to 0.7.0

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-03-25 21:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11177):

Closes #11171.

This PR is not strictly required, because circleci just install `pygments-lexer-solidity` globally, without the `requirements.txt`. This means the CI doesn't care what version we require, but at least any update is automatically visible on docs.soliditylang.org.

Anyhow, for clarity it is nice to merge this and we may want to fix CI later.
