This PR suggests some more refactoring of the code handling assignments in SMTChecker.
It centralizes the handling of defining given SMT Expression as a new value for the given Solidity Expression in the method `SMTEncoder::assign(Expression const&, smtutil::Expression const&, Type const*)` with the aim of reducing code duplication.

@blishko does this PR depend on the query order PR?

Not exactly, but it actually changes the encoding slightly (it removes one redundant re-definition of an expression, I believe).
So it requires update to the expected output of the command line tests.

I thought it would be better to actually properly see the changes in the expected output, and *that* depends on the query order PR.

@blishko I think we should merge this. Can you rebase?

Yes, I will, just need to resolve the conflict in the tests output.

Rebased, with updated expected output of command line tests outputting JSON objects.
