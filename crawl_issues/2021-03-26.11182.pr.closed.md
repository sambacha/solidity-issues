# [\#11182 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11182) `closed`: Add index for queries in the JSON output to fix the order of the queries

This PR represents the first step towards the goal of understanding when a change in the encoding happens and manifests in the JSON output tests.
Here we try to fix the order of the unanswered queries in the JSON object by adding a prefix counter before the hash.
When the answers are provided, the prefix is removed (if still present) upon reading the JSON object.

Shouldn't this be a design discussion? Wouldn't the ideal solution be making the queries an array?

@axic actually I wanted to bring this up in the design discussion to be removed entirely

We could go ahead with this PR by making it an array. It's a minimal change and allows us to fix the order for now.

OK, I also like the array solution better.
It's a change in the JSON structure, but at least we may see if anybody is using this feature :)

Does it make sense to implement the change to the array?
If we just remove the queries from the JSON output (if a solver is present) and thus remove the check from command line tests, then it is not necessary to change anything in the JSON structure, no?

If we *would* implement the change, then "smtlib2queries" would become an array of objects with two fields, "hash" and "query"? Is that the intended design?

Yea, let's go with removing the queries if a solver was present.

What's the status here? Does it need more reviews or is it waiting for fixes?

Has any decision about outputting the queries been made?
I could finish the change to store the queries as array instead of object, but I am not sure if it is needed anymore.

I think this isn't needed anymore, so I'll close it for now. We can restart the discussion at some point if needed.
