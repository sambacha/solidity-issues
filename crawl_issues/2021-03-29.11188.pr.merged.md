# [\#11188 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11188) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix crash when analysing try-catch clauses with function call.

Fixes #11181.

The referenced issue shows that SMTChecker crashes when BMC engine is analyzing try-catch clauses where a catch clause calls a function which returns value or contains local variables.

The reason was that `SMTEncoder::mergeVariables` assumes that the true branch is analyzed before the false branch. However, merging information from all the try-catch clauses is done differently and this assumption is not satisfied.

To fix the problem either `BMC::visit(TryStatement)` or `SMTEncoder::mergeVariables` needs to be changed.

This PR proposes the second way. Since the function is getting the information about the indices of **all** variables in the symbolic state for both the true and false branch, the `touched` variables are actually not needed. We can simply update only those variables present in both branches but with different indices. The rest of the variables do not need to be updated.
