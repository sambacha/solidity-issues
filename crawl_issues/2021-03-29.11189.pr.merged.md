# [\#11189 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11189) `merged`: [solc-bin] Fix commit range used by bytecode PR check

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-03-29 15:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11189):

The check used currently checked out commit as the end of the range instead of the one specified in `top_ref` parameter.

Fortunately this bug did not have any consequences in solc-bin because there we pass the checked out commit in this parameter anyway.
