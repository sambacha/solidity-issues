# [\#11190 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11190) `merged`: [solc-bin] Add version check to bytecode PR check

Some caveats:
- The check is not performed on Windows (because the bytecode PR check does not run on Windows).
- Failing check interrupts bytecode generation so even if multiple binaries are affected, we'll only be notified about one.
    - I would have to make it a separate script and duplicate some code if we want to let the bytecode comparison finish.
- For some older versions the hash in the name was shorter than the one used in `--version`. They were symlinked under new names but they exist under the old ones too. For those the check will not succeed.
    - Maybe I should modify the bytecode PR check so that it does not run on anything below 0.7.0?

Dummy solc-bin PR to test the new check: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/89.

Locally it worked but in the PR the check fails for some other reason and only prints this:

```
Binary solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.4+commit.194ff033 (version 0.8.4) matches one of the modified versions.
Error: Process completed with exit code 128.
```

Switching to draft while I debug this.

Looks like it's fine now. I'm not 100% what the issue was but I suspect it caused by the fact that I used 0.8.4 for the misnamed binary in the test PR. A tag for that does not exist so git fails but for some reason in the Linux job there was no error message about it.
