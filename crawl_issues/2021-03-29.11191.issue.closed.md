[Formal Specification of the Encoding](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/abi-spec.html#formal-specification-of-the-encoding) is precise but pretty dense which makes understanding it hard for people who are not already intimately familiar with the ABI. Even explaining it can sometimes be hard without tediously going through concrete examples, see for example [this discussion on gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=60546a023b9278255bbc90a5). The examples that are already available in the spec help but are not enough on their own.

We should rewrite this section to make it easier to digest. Or at least expand it and add a diagram. I think that visualizing the layout and nesting would be the best way to make it easy to understand.

I think it is important to keep the specification itself concise, but we should add more examples and explain it a bit better either before or afterwards.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I've heard people complain about the current spec being hard to understand several times so I think we should really do this. Reopening.

I'm disagreeing, our main job is to provide the spec, everything else is optional and this is too low priority to keep an issue about, unless it's actively opened by somebody other than us.
