Removes `mstore(key, ...)` if memory location `[key, key + 32)` is not read.

The step is not added to full suite, just like reasoning based simplifier.

Not having read much of this PR - is it possible to at least optimize multiple stores to the same variable that is not changed in between and no other memory operations happen? Maybe by implementing a trivial solver that just does equality?

Also why don't you handle storage and memory at the same time?

I think this should be done separately because it'll require control flow analysis. The current one is quite simple, since it doesn't have to do worry about control flow.

> Also why don't you handle storage and memory at the same time?

The current rule, i.e., removing `mstore(key, ...)` if `[key, key + 32)` is never read, is only applicable to `memory`. For storage, we could only remove "multiple `sstore` to the same slot".

About also handling sstore: Sure, but that's the only difference.

I just realized that there can be a weird edge case for such optimizations:

```
let x := 2**128
mstore(x, 1)
sstore(0, mload(x))
```

Load resolver can resolve this to 

```
let x := 2**128
mstore(x, 1)
sstore(0, 1)
```

The current PR can then replace it with

```
let x := 2**128
sstore(0, 1)
```

The first snippet can never get evaluated on EVM. [EIP 1985](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1985) even makes it invalid to some extent. I don't know if we should allow such transformations to be possible.

Maybe we should - if we all agree on that - specifically document somewhere that for code generation and optimization we assume an idealized EVM with unlimited gas and unlimited memory - then the answer to that concern would be that it's definitely fine to do this anyways (which it should be as far as I'm concerned).

Yes, the optimization above should be totally fine. The only place where we do not optimizer is infinite loops and infinite recursion.
Essentially, we optimize assuming an arbitrary but finite gas limit.

Added new tests `eip1985.yul` (test case from the few comments before) and `msize.yul`.

Is it possible to disentangle the solver part and the optimizer part so that this can also work with a very very very simple engine like the 'KnowledgeBase.h'? Something like this could also easily determine that `revert(0, 0)` and similar functions do not actually read or write from or to memory.

@hrkrshnn are you still going to work on this?

@leonardoalt It should be more or less complete, except some minor review comments.

However, we have moved to using `memoryguard(...)` in Yul. This optimization steps works better if memory offsets are static. In the past, this was okay, because load resolver would be able to convert some memory operations to static ones. But with `memoryguard(...)`, this would never happen.

So do we move towards merging or closing this?

Closing this for now.
