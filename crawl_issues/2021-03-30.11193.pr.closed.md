Thanks for the PR! It is going back and forth a bit, can you squash the commits, please?

> Replace vector_ref and bytesRef with ranges::span.

There is a completely separate issue for that, I would not conflate it with this.

Maybe we should create a separate issue for it then? It was mentioned in #10738.

There are separate issues for it, ie #7795. We did some of these changes when we worked on FixedHash but was not fully merged. Anyhow, let's just get rid of all the simple boost cases addressed by this PR.

Oh, also please remove `Fixes #10738` from the PR description since we don't want to close that issue just yet (i.e. not until all the stuff listed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11193#pullrequestreview-624372179 is fixed).

@cameel, Please ignore this PR, created a much cleaner PR #11203.

Remaining comments from this PR, will be taken up separately
