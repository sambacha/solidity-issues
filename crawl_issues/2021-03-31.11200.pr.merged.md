# [\#11200 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11200) `merged`: Fixing auto update for macos

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23421619?u=50068b46fd9aafcb2b59c0d93b9eb49692ba9c66&v=4" width="50">[mijovic](https://github.com/mijovic) opened issue at [2021-03-31 14:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11200):

`-N` is not supported on macos, so we need to use `-n` which has slightly different behaviour according to manual:

```
-n nchars return after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting for a newline, 
but honor a delimiter if fewer than NCHARS characters are read before the delimiter

-N nchars return only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, 
unless EOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any delimiter
```

If we are fine with that change, I would like to merge, as it will fix auto-update feature for command line tests.
