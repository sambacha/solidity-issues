Applied suggestions from @cameel and rebased appropriately. I would not squash since the commits make sense individually.

Yeah, it's split pretty nicely. It was much easier reviewing that way since the 1000+ updated tests were clearly separated and did not get in the way.

I wish github would let me mark individual commits as reviewed though (and unmark them automatically when a commit changes). I wonder if there is some offline review tool that has this feature. I used to always review commit by commit but I got used to the combined view lately mostly because of that ability.
