@hrkrshnn we discussed this last week, I don't remember - what was the conclusion?

@chriseth I'm not sure if we had a conclusion.

I would say the following should be how we resolve this:

- Allow non-public variable declarations to have NatSpec, and therefore `notice` since it's the default. (So local variables and non-public state variables) Already implemented here.
- Export `StructuredDocumentation` instead of `Documented` for statements (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11205#discussion_r605759251) should be done separately. Maybe we can do this as a bugfix, since the changelog already mentions this https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md#082-2021-03-02.

And what is the problem that prevents us from making dev the default for non-public variables?

@chriseth Making "notice" as default for non-public variables is that currently it's done in DocStringParser.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/parsing/DocStringParser.cpp#L112

While it's probably possible to get the information that the node is a public state variable, I'm not sure if it will run into issues. Let me implement it and see how it goes.

I'm sorry, it seems I misunderstood: Do we currently default to `@notice` for everything, even for internal functions, contracts and statements inside functions?

@chriseth I reverted the change to `dev`. Now, it allows `notice` on non-public state variables. And removes a parser check about `public` / `non-public` for NatSpec.
