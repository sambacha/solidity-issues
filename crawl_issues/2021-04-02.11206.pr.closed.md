# [\#11206 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11206) `closed`: script to automate updates to robots.txt

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71412187?v=4" width="50">[cxxboy](https://github.com/cxxboy) opened issue at [2021-04-02 07:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11206):

Hi, I'm first time contributing to solidity.
I'm trying to solve #11199 

I have written a Perl script which reads the `robots.txt` and checks the currently allowed version against the one returned by `get_version.sh` and if it sees the same version numbers(i.e there is no changes from the output of `get_version.sh` and the one allowed on `robots.txt`) the script does nothing and exits. If it sees the different version number from the one outputted by `get_version.sh`, it changes the version and makes the previous version as `Disallow`

Example, if the `robots.txt` file have 
```
...
# Allow the latest release
#Disallow: /en/v0.8.3/
```  
but the version returned by `get_version.sh` is `0.8.4`, it changes the `robots.txt` file as follows

```
...
# Allow the latest release
Disallow: /en/v0.8.3/
#Disallow: /en/v0.8.4/
```
But if the `get_version.sh` script also outputs `0.8.3`, `robots.txt` file remains untouched.

Let me know if there are any comments, suggestions or changes.

Hello @cxxboy. Thanks for contributing!

The thing is, #10972 has not been merged yet so I think it would be best to wait for a conclusion there. Looks like I might have been too quick with creating an issue for the autoupdate but I did not think someone would submit a PR for that already :)

The other thing is that we already have scripts written in a bunch of languages (Bash, JavaScript, Python) and I think that adding another one to the mix might not be the best idea. Honestly, I don't even know Perl. Not sure about others on the team. I see that the script is invoking Bash commands like `sed` anyway so apparently your reason for using Perl is not portability - so why not use Bash instead?

@cameel 
Sorry about late reply, I have pushed a bash version like you suggested.
But not sure why the CI test fails(since I cannot see the CI's logs)

One more thing: the last point on [the release checklist for docs](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2962d48593fb5542af7049d891777ecd896addaf/ReleaseChecklist.md#documentation) should be updated.

@cxxboy How is the progress on the PR? Are you still working on it?

We're having a cleanup week right now and trying to reduce the number of pending PRs (we've hit 60+ at one point). Is there a way I could help you finish it and get it merged?

Hi @chriseth, I had made the change you mentioned. I'm very new to rebase workflow. I had followed some instructions and rebased my branch on-top-of develop. And I had to resolve a conflict on 'robots.txt' from the other person during rebase. But looks like on my commit, it added whole bunch of stuff: https://github.com/cxxboy/solidity/commit/67b59246ba528f5aee614aa1e77467e888890556
Can you please help me with this one?

@cxxboy I think that the problem is that your code is still not based on latest `develop`. Could you make sure that you're rebasing on on `dce3006723e56f60c7f89d6095e14298ef154945`?

BTW, I recommend interactive rebase so that you can easily pick and drop commits.

First make sure your `develop` branch is up to date:
```bash
git fetch origin
git check develop
git merge origin/develop --ff-only
```
Then rebase:
```bash
git checkout update_robots_script
git rebase develop --interactive
```

The `--interactive` option will open an editor where you can select commits to be included. Make sure you pick only your own commits. Any merge commits or base commits carried over from previous location should be dropped.

I'm really sorry, @cameel I think I messed something up real bad so I think I need to start over again. I cannot seem to recover and I'm relatively a beginner in git. Can I close this PR and make a new one with the updated scripts in there? Or what else do you suggest?

Well, we still have the commit IDs of previous versions you pushed so it should be easy to recover. I'll post the commands in a moment.

In the meantime, I tried to find some articles that would explain the workflow nicely. Maybe you could take a look at one of these?

I see that the last commit without the mess is 5b74e9e290ef83a731fe9179dc7ccadc0d90a2a7. Does it contain all your changes? If so, you can move your branch back to that place with:

```bash
# Make a backup label at the current location of your branch, just in case
git checkout update_robots_script
git checkout -B backup-update_robots_script

# Move the branch to an old commit
git checkout 5b74e9e290ef83a731fe9179dc7ccadc0d90a2a7
git checkout -B update_robots_script
```

@cameel The commit 5b74e9e290ef83a731fe9179dc7ccadc0d90a2a7, doesn't have one change that I made to remove Perl and used `tr`. In this case can I just make that change and amend the commit?

Ok. We we can try differently. Do you have a copy of the latest version of the file you modified? If so you can just reset the branch and recreate the commits from scratch:

```
git checkout develop
git checkout -B update_robots_script
```

**NOTE: This will remove all changes from your branch and move it to the current `develop`**. Then you will be able to replace the file with the copy, commit it and push the branch.

Just to be clear: I think it would be fine to start a new PR if you really wanted that but I think it's not really needed because fixing this one should be pretty simple. If you do https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11206#issuecomment-826871612, you basically start from scratch with your branch anyway. git is nice in that it does not really modify your commits, it always creates new ones so it's possible to go back to a previous state from almost any situation.

@cameel The commit 67b59246ba528f5aee614aa1e77467e888890556 sticks with the develop so even if I follow your instruction, I end up with that messy state. I think it's easy for me if I close this PR and start a fresh one with the updated scripts.
And regarding that, I will be cloning the fresh repo and make the changes in `robots_update_script` branch and follow(and previously followed) these commands to rebase the develop. But I'm not sure if this is what I need to do:
```
git checkout robots_update_script
// I makes the changes
git commit
git rebase develop
git checkout develop
git rebase robots_update_script
git push origin robots_update_script
// and I open a new PR
```
Can you please see if these steps look good and I can just follow this?

No, this is not correct. Especially this part makes no sense:
```bash
git checkout develop
git rebase robots_update_script
```

I think you're trying to use `rebase` like `merge`. You're first rebasing your branch on `develop` but then turning around and trying to rebase `develop` on it. Which is not an error but is totally not what you want. This just moves `develop` label to point at the same commit as your branch. This is why that commit "sticks".

You should reset your `develop` to match the upstream.

Here's how it should work:

```bash
# Ensure that your develop matches the one from the repository
git fetch origin
git checkout origin/develop
git checkout -B develop

git checkout robots_update_script
# Make the changes
git commit

# Always use interactive rebase. When the editor opens, ensure that the list contains only your own
# commits and no older commits are getting dragged along with it. If they are, just remove them from
# the list
git rebase develop --interactive

# Force push is usually needed after you rebase. This is fine as long as you're only doing it with your
# feature branch (and not e.g. `develop`).
git push origin robots_update_script --force-with-lease

# If you do all the above, there's no need to open a new PR.
# When you push, this one will be updated just fine.
```

EDIT: Missed the `-B` in `git checkout -B develop`.

Here is a shorter version that does not use the local `develop` branch:
```
# Ensure that your develop matches the one from the repository
git fetch origin

git checkout robots_update_script
# Make the changes
git commit

# Always use interactive rebase. When the editor opens, ensure that the list contains only your own
# commits and no older commits are getting dragged along with it. If they are, just remove them from
# the list
git rebase origin/develop --interactive

# Force push is usually needed after you rebase. This is fine as long as you're only doing it with your
# feature branch (and not e.g. `develop`).
git push origin robots_update_script --force-with-lease

# If you do all the above, there's no need to open a new PR.
# When you push, this one will be updated just fine.

Yeah. Though if the local branch has diverged I think it's better if @cxxboy fixes it too :)

@chriseth @cameel I ended up starting from fresh. My new PR is #11317
