# [\#11207 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11207) `closed`: Detail or remove overflow handling (I needed to know max value of uint to understand commentary.)

My first reaction when reading "ensures that there are no overflow errors in the future" was "yeah right", because it only checked input.  What I needed to understand is that the amount being minted is limited to a very small amount relative to the maximum value that can be held by `uint` (I did not know what that was off the top of my head) - no overflow is not entirely prevented, but it will not overflow in the first call to mint(), or any reasonable feasible of calls, and so not easily by calls to send() either where there's no such checks. If that's the intent/design, perhaps being more specific as in this edit will help people like me see that right off.

Update: Second option is to remove the LOC purported to handle overflow, simplifying the sample, removing the bump I hit altogether.

No meaning to the close-and-reopen - hit the CLOSE button in GitHub mobile app by mistake. Thanks for ignoring!
