Please split this up further. The first PR should only be a change to AST.h

I wanted to do it as well. It is very hard to follow if I don't split.

I think it would be really great to have a singular refactoring PR (which add DebugData without `originLocation` but does not make any behavioural changes). Then the second commit can deal with the IR changes.

We also want the parser to eventually read the `/// @origin` annotation and fill out the DebugData, but we should do that in a new PR.

Thanks for suggestion, that sound like a good idea. Especially about the first PR that doesn't add any changes, except just refactoring to include DebugData instead of location.
Will try splitting it now and push only the refactor to this PR

Closing because I opened new one #11294 that is pure refactoring. After that is finished, I'll add origin location in another PR
