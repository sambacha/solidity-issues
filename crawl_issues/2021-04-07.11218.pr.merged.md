Needs rebase. It's based on a commit where we had problems with the macOS build in `develop`.

> Looks good. Might be useful to create a file `090-breaking-changes.rst` and add something about errors, just like in `080-breaking-changes.rst`.

Done. And also added the errors change into the "new restrictions" section. If everything else is okay, we could at least reduce the PR count by 1. :-)

Why was this an important change? Why do we keep those others things as non-keywords?
