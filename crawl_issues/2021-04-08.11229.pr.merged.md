Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11110.

This should serve as basis for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11110 as is without any further changes (@aarlt).

In case anyone else, like me, is not very familiar with ANTLR, here are some links that helped me understand changes in this PR:
- [The ANTLR Mega Tutorial > 22. Parser Grammars](https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial/#chapter44) - explains the change from `grammar` to `parser grammar` and the seemigly unused `SingleQuote` and `DoubleQuote` tokens.
- [Sphinx plugin for Antlr4 > Control comments](https://amatanhead.github.io/sphinx-a4doc/#control-comments) - the `//@ doc:inline` directive.

Ah, damn it, sorry, I did already fix the tests and the superfluous ``cat``, but then force-pushed over it from a wrong checkout -.-... fixing now...

I don't think anyone uses it thus far, but maybe we should ask just to be sure.

EDIT: just posted in the solc-tooling channel, I guess we should wait a bit to see, if anyone says something, otherwise it's probably fine to merge.
