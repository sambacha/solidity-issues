It's a stand-alone command-line binary. It's not supposed to install anything.

It has no GUI. You need to open a CMD or PowerShell session to interact with it.

How then do I use it to compile a smart contract, say in some other folder? Apologies as this could be a trivial question, but i'm kinda slow..

Something like this:
```
solc.exe C:\your\project\dir\contracts\file.sol --base-path C:\your\project\dir
```
And you only really need `--base-path` if you're not in the main project dir.
