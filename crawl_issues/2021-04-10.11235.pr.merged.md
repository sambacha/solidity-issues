# [\#11235 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11235) `merged`: Allow using stdin in cmdlineTests

- If no `input.*` files are present in test directory, does not assume `input.sol` by default and does not pass any file name (not even `""`) to `solc` in that case.
- If a file called `stdin` is present and it's not a JSON test, puts its content on standard input of the compiler.

@hrkrshnn I wanted to include a regression test in #11236 but without this I could not.
