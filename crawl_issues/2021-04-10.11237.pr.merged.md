# [\#11237 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11237) `merged`: Fix exit code update in cmdlineTests

Looks like I used the wrong value in #10832. The expectation should be updated to match the actual result, not just be overwritten with itself.

Why did it not fail before though?

It did, but I suspect no one noticed or no one bothered to look into it. This particular line never runs in CI - it only runs interactively, when the script asks you to update the expectation and you agree (or if you use the `--autoupdate` parameter). I vaguely remember running into it myself earlier but I'm used to having to update the `exit` file manually so I think I did not investigate back then but just fixed it myself.
