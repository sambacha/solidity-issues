Open questions:
- What should we copy from the Yul-optimizer Readme vs. what is too much information? / Do we still need such a lenghty readme or should we move the important content to the docs? --> https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/README.md
- What stays in the Yul Optimizer Docs section and what goes in the general one? --> https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.3/yul.html#yul-optimizer
- Where do we still use ``Optimiser``as opposed to ``Optimizer``?

I think it's fine to move the full readme to the docs, but we should also delete the readme.

The documentation inside the yul.rst file is good as it is - it mainly explains how to use the optimizer on the commandline and what the step names are, but it should link to the new documentation once it is there.

The list of all steps is defined in `libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp` around line `181` (`OptimiserSuite::allSteps`) - can you copy all of them over (I mean just the name as a header) and add something like "to be documented" if they are not documented yet?

I deleted the content and linked to the two docs sections (optimizer docs and Yul docs) that are relevant.

Linked the new documentation and vice versa.

Tried my best!

To aid reviewing, injected a commit that only renames the file.

Assuming you meant ``Statement-Scale Simplifications`` with ``Statement Level`` @chriseth or should I create another category called ``Statement Level``?

There is an extra binary file `docs/.DS_Store`. What is that @franzihei

Weird... maybe it got generated when I built the docs locally? I don't really know where that file comes from @hrkrshnn
