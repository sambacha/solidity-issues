There's something weird going on with the diff on github here :-). So I can't really see anymore what you're doing ;-).
But if I understood correctly, you're now running the entire optimizer before the stack limit evader?
In order for things not to break it should be enough to run the "CirularReferencesPruner" (which requires Disambiguator and FunctionHoister) - so maybe it makes sense to restrict to only those? That would make it quicker to analyze the results and should save quite some time during fuzzing...

[Also as a note: I just force-pushed another quick fix into the target branch, which should fix the test failures here and would probably be saner to rebase this on]

Could you please check if the latest commit addresses this?

I ran the fuzzer with circular references prune + stack limit evader with stack allocation optimisation turned on. It found this stack too deep error: https://gist.github.com/bshastry/a8955888959a5c568f6b715e20d55078

Please ignore the report above: It contains a recursive. It looks like I only filtered functions calling themselves but not stuff like A->B->A

Generally it's not too bad to also verify that the stack limit evader correctly does nothing on recursions - but it makes it hard to interpret the result.

In principle the logic would be "if there is any stack too deep error inside control flow occurring in a recursive call, expect the stack limit evader to leave the AST unchanged - if not expect no stack too deep errors to occur"...

That is: there is even *some* cases with recursions the stack limit evader will be able to run on - as long as the stack errors only ever occur before or after the recursive part... but I'm not sure it's worth the effort to distinguish all of those cases properly...

The really important part is that we don't get any case that has a differing storage trace.

```C++
bool expectSuccess(Dialect& _dialect, Object& _object)
{
auto recursiveFunctions = CallGraphGenerator::callGraph(*_object.code).recursiveFunctions();
for(auto&& [function, variables]: CompilabilityChecker{
				_dialect,
				_object,
				true
			}.unreachableVariables)
  if(recursiveFunctions.count(function))
    return false;
return true;
}
```

That should give you the condition... if that returns ``false``, the stack limit evader should leave the AST unchanged (and you will have stack too deep errors) - if it returns ``true`` there should be no stack errors...

I guess we no longer need this either, so I'm closing.
