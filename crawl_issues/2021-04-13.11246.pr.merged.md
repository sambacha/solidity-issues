The advantage being that this is more costly ;-)?
But yeah, I do get that https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11243 may seem a bit hacky...

Just scrolled through it: Thus far the test diff seems identical to the one in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11243, except that the gas costs are not yet updated here.
