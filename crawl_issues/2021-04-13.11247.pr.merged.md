Do we want something like this?
There would probably quite a few cases we could use it.

Sounds very useful! Naming: What about `SaveAndRestore`? `StashValue` (like 'git stash')?

Yeah, naming this is a bit tricky... I like both of those names, but they'd fit better, if the class *only* did the saving and restoring part without modifying the value as well.
It'd probably be nicer if the class actually only *did* that, but it'd be less usable especially for move-only types or non-default-constructible types that way...

Maybe also good to mention `Scope` in the name... so maybe ``ScopedSaveAndRestore`` or ``ScopedStashValue``...

`ScopedSaveAndRestore` sounds good to me

I'm just merging this now, so I can use it - we can still change it later, if we want.
