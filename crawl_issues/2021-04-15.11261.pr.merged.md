Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11168

Can you fix the failing test, and rebase on top of #11256? I think it would be easier to review that way.

Decision in call:

JSON:
- Keep format object "SourceName": [ContractName1, ContractName2]
- Empty source name => error
- Non existent source name => error
- Non existent contract name => error
- Empty contract name array => error

CLI:
- Comma separated string of pairs "sourceName":"contractName"
- Empty/invalid names => error
- No `none`
- use `default` instead of `all`

@axic thinking about it again, it's actually not so easy to detect that the source/contract names don't exist in the given sources

Well could also just issue a warning in the smtchecker at the end of the runtime stating "request contract x,y,z was not found".

That's true, but to what location do we point?

No location? Like the prerelease warning.

One problem at the moment here is the command line tests for this. I added a test with args `--model-checker-engine all --model-checker-contracts "`pwd`/input.sol:A"` to check only one contract, but doesn't work. Any ideas how this could work?

Fixed comments & rebased.
Some comments still might need discussion.

I am fine with answers, it wasn't nothing major. Also, it makes sense to not emit warning for listing abstract contract. Also it was added to documentation. I think it is looking good now, I still didn't finish reviewing all the tests, so will do it now

@axic had also approved before and the changes were minor, so I'm merging
