# [\#11263 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11263) `closed`: Path resolution docs (current state only)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-04-15 23:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11263):

Replaces #11105.
Related to #11138, #11036 and #9353.

This is a reworked version of #11105 that only describes the current state, without any proposed modifications. The goal is to get it merged and included in a release before we start changing how this stuff works.

To implement https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11105#pullrequestreview-617770242, I have created a separate section called "Path Resolution" in the side menu. The "Layout of a Solidity Source File" now only contains a short summary of the part needed to understand import paths.

The biggest change compared to the original docs is that any mention of absolute imports has been removed and now I only distinguish between "direct" and "relative" imports. I have also moved a lot of the extra details to notes/warnings to separate them from the main flow of the text and simplified them slightly where I could.

I have just pushed a new version with all the points above addressed. All the changes are in fixups.

I'm going to close it now and split in two parts. One will go into a separate PR with the excessive examples and explanations removed. The other will become a blog post.

Closing in favor of #11442.
