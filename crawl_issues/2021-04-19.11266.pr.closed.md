Found in #10768
These functions would be re-used there. Also, there were two bugs fixed here:
- There was no check for max array size in case of byte array push
- Also there was a bug in `partialClearStorageSlot`. Byte arrays are left aligned, and this function was called in case of copying array to storage, which didn't show up because we didn't have a test that resizes long byte array to shorter but still long byte array. When I re-used function for byte array pop it showed up immediately
