## Abstract

It is a typical scenario for an entire function to be implemented with native (unsafe until solc 0.8.0) arithmetic operations, in order to optimize its performance, and under the author's knowledge of the function being robust for arithmetic overflows.

## Motivation

According to [the official documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic):

> To avoid ambiguity, you cannot use `_;` inside an `unchecked` block.

Subsequently, one cannot implement a `modifier` which would allow "declaring" an entire function `unchecked`.

## Specification

Please consider supporting `unchecked` at the function-declaration level, in order to allow for cleaner code.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
