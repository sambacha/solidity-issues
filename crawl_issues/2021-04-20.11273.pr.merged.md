# [\#11273 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11273) `merged`: Adds fmtlib as 3rdparty dependency for easier string composition.

Adds fmtlib as 3rdparty dependency. It'll be part of C++20 anyways, and I feel like maybe other code paths (not just mine) will definitely benefit from it.

You should rebase this on the current `develop`. It has a fix for the failing `b_osx` job.

The big question is: do we actually want to use fmtlib?

Is there a downside to making it available? We will eventually get it as a part of C++20 anyway and @christianparpart apparently already has a use for it the LSP so why not?

Well, so far we only merged features which are actually used or we plan to widely use them. I've seen some comments on gitter questioning whether we want to use it widely?

IIRC, we once got the go on range-v3 and fmtlib quite some time ago (before everyone had to sit on home office) with the condition to only do when we need it (and not doing it as prior one). That is looking ago.

I am using fmtlib in the LSP PR after long time of feeling uncomfortable of writing `a + b + ...` string chains a lot i finally decided to move on. So this PR therefore isn't using it yet, yes.

P.s. oh, @axic i just realized you force pushed intro this PR. That's fine with me. I try to connect with you tomorrow in chat on that matter of needed.

Also, if this isn't going to be closed without merge, i can test `debuild` as requested realize, if not yet done already.

To be fair sentiment/agreement can change over time, so whatever decision was made >1 year ago may not apply today.

As mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11273#issuecomment-824753517 it is just a rebase, the changes are in a separate commit.

What is cmake debuild?

I think it builds a Debian package. Never used it personally but @chriseth mentioned it above so he probably does. Also, if it does not work with it, other features might be broken in a similar way so I think it's good to check that.

Ok, so `debuild` has nothing to do with cmake, it is this: https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/debuild.1.html

I can hardly test this on macOS :)

@axic I've squashed both of our commit into one. And I also made sure that `debuild` (i.e. PPA release build) is working.

I don't regard this as very useful for most of our code, but please provide examples.

I've added some example use for `YulString` and especially `ErrorReporter.typeError(...)`. I did not adapt any other member function in error reporter as I first wanted to see if accept that.

I came here actually to close it now but I read that. Yes, I had that in mind, too, but also I wanted to defer the closing until @ekpyron is back. So what about this week Wednesday? (I think he's back now) :)

I cannot really do much about a general dislike of fmtlib syntax and preferring ``+``ing stuff, though :-).
There's only two ways I can think of to actually get access to local variables in string literals - a full blown custom preprocessor (I don't think even macros can do this) or waiting for C++ reflection, which is not even in C++20 - (and even with reflection this would be quite a hassle and probably still require macros)... neither of which I'd see happening :-).

One thing to keep in mind is that generally fmtlib is faster than iostreams or most other means of formatting and that we could probably extend it to replace ``Whiskers`` entirely (although that would take a bit of doing)...

Please not that it is not about "dislikes", but a risk of introducing bugs by swapping values.

I'm not sure that risk is actually objectively higher either way.

It's still waiting for discussion. I think that next Wednesday would be a good moment.

@chriseth thinks this makes it less readable and seems against it, @christianparpart is in favor.
Did we ever discuss this in the round? Any conclusions?

@chriseth depending on your final judgement, I could eliminate all but the cmake changes in this PR, and bring it up to date. that way we could even merge it today, IMHO.

Way to install is fine for me, so this can go in, but I would like to use magic features very sparingly.

When it is merged, we should create a develop ppa package to verify that it is working.
