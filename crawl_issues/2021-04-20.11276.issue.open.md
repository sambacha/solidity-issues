@MrChico any insights on what we could try to verify here?
I guess most stuff might be too hard anyway given the amount of math in the contract.

Maybe the property hinted to on [L111](https://github.com/dapphub/chai/blob/master/src/chai.sol#L111) would be interesting:
```
        // rounding up ensures dst gets at least wad dai
```
One could modify `move` to express this property:
```
    function move(address src, address dst, uint wad) external returns (bool) {
        uint chi = (now > pot.rho()) ? pot.drip() : pot.chi();
        // rounding up ensures dst gets at least wad dai
        uint preBal = dai[dst];
        bool res = transferFrom(src, dst, rdivup(wad, chi));
        uint postBal = dai[dst];
        assert(postBal - preBal >= wad);
        return res;
    }
```

Is there a 0.8.x compatible version of chai now? :)

No, it's not being actively iterated upon right now

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
