# [\#11277 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11277) `merged`: Normalize tests to match isoltest output (only trivial changes)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-04-20 15:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11277):

Extracted from #10612.

Only contains the obvious trivial change. No functionality changes or test changes that would make them worse.

I grouped changes by type into individual commits for ease of review: github requires you to manually load files when there are too many of them. For that reason I recommend reviewing individual commits.
