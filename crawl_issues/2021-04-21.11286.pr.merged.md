# [\#11286 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11286) `merged`: Upgrade to EVMC 8.0.0 + evmone 0.7.0

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-04-21 21:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11286):

Depends on #11372.

Part of #11060.

This compiles, but 
- will need an updated evmone
- will need the final evmc release (though I do not think the files will change, this is 8.0.0-alpha.2)

How is this passing tests? Aren't we running evmone on CI?

Does this PR update the gas costs?

No, but it changes the ABI version and the old evmone binary can't be loaded anymore.

It seems testing does not consider that a failure.

This now matches the evmc 8.0.0 release.

We actually use a mixture of evmone 0.4.0/0.4.1/0.5.0 currently. Apparently because 0.5.0 was needed for the windows build and other places were not updated.

Should we add evmc 8 / evmone 0.7.0 to the changelog or it is not important as it is for testing? (Berlin support will be addressed in #11060).

For the record: This needs to be split into two PRs - one updating the docker images only, one changing the used docker image hashes and changing the expected ABI version in our sources. I'll keep this open for reference and will create two separate ones, that, combined, will achieve what this PR attempted.

Yep, we discussed that is the road to merging it, however for some reason the new evmone builds were not visible in the built image. Splitting it won't fix that issue?

Let me see, I'll inspect the images built in the other PR. If they do not contain evmone builds, we can fix it there. If they do, they can just be used here.

They did just likely at the wrong path.
