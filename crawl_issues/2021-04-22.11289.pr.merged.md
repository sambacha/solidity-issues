Previously CHCSmtLib2Interface was using z3's the `rule` language sugar to describe Horn clauses. This PR changes it to the proper smtlib2 Horn logic which other solvers can also understand. That is the main fix and is coded in the first commit.
The other commits add other small fixes that I felt were small enough to be just single commits in this same PR:
- `implies` is not smtlib2, `=>` is the right operator
- negative number literals cannot be represented by `-10` in smtlib2. It needs to be either `(- 10)` or `(0 - 10)`. Here I went with the latter to avoid overloading the minus operator.
- In pure smtlib2, `/` is actually Real division, whereas we want Integer division which is `div`
- `gasleft()` should be `gasleft`
- Manual two's complement should use `bvnat` first

With these changes, the queries given by CHCSmtLib2Interface can actually be read by any Horn solver that reads smtlib2.
We don't have direct tests for that, because:
- They are tested in the solc-js tests, which is part of `t_ems` BUT
- Since we have z3 statically linked in soljson.js, the queries never actually run. This will be fixed next but I need the fixes here to go in first. I tested them locally and it works fine.

Yea the last commit has parts that would have to into different commits, so I would merge as is since it's not too much.
