# [\#11293 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11293) `merged`: Split EthAssemblyAdapter from AsmCodeGen

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-04-22 12:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11293):

This was done at the same time some of the other libyul refactorings (e.g. renaming AsmData to AST) but was forgotten. The goal here is to disentangle EthAssemblyAdapter (which is used by AssemblyStack too) from AsmCodeGen (which is only used by the old codegen for inline assembly).

We can close if it does not make it cleaner.

Oh wait - we have to merge verbatim first :)
