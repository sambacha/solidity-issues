# [\#11303 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11303) `merged`: Remove the usage of boost::noncopyable

Part of #7259.

Prior to this half of the codebase used explicit deleted copy constructors, the others used boost::noncopyable. I do not care which approach we take, but would prefer we follow a single one and not a mix as of today.

Disclaimer: I did this a while back, but felt never is a good time submitting more refactorings ðŸ˜¬

My personal take is that if you need to add a comment, it is probably not the best approach.
