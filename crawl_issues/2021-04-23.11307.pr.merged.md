Actually, why do we need these identifiers? Isn't `name` unique enough already?

It is unique, but please read the linked issue.

I've read it already but it does not explain why we want the ID. It just assumes a priori that we need one for github. It's for the CVE field, right? We could just as well use `name` there unless it requires some specific format for the ID (does it?).

I'm not saying IDs are a bad idea but we already have one so I'm not sure it makes sense to introduce another :)

I remember it being more restrictive when the issue was created, but it does not seem to have many restrictions now. By convention though every major system uses the naming scheme as proposed in this PR (go-ethereum and vyper recently introduced the same, after we created the issue) and not the free standing text Solidity has. I guess we can keep using the free standing text, just may be confusing to people used to the CVE-style identifiers.

Well, let's get more opinions here :) @chriseth?

 As for me, having CVE-style identifiers sounds good on one hand but on the other we already have one ID system so adding another one might actually just add to the confusion.

I'm fine adding a CVE style id. It's  nice to see the year.

In that case we just need a decision on which variant to choose to handle multiple entries referring to the same bug (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11307#discussion_r619507255).

My vote would be for c).

I guess we have the differing name due to the a shortcoming how versions can be expressed, and if tools like etherscan depend on that name as a key, maybe we should not change them. However we can claim that the "CVE-style ID" is unique, and users of the JSON should combine entries with the same `uid` to display it affects different compiler ranges.

That means both "UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor" and "UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor_0.4.x" has "uid:SOL-2019-7". We can also ask these tools to start using the uid instead going forward.

@axic Given that @chriseth said on the meeting that he is fine with either choice, I'd say let's switch this PR from a) to c) and get it merged.

We have briefly discussed this on the meeting and it seems https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11307#discussion_r619507255 caused a bit of confusion:
- option c) meant that the `name` and `uid` fields will be matching for that case, i.e. `UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor` and `SOL-2019-7`.
- option d) would mean that `name` stays as-is and we introduce `uid` where it is the same value for `UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor` and `UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor_0.4.x`

Following the idea in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11307#issuecomment-828584791, I think we should go with d) for now, reach out to Etherscan and potentially go with c) in the future.

Small clarification after today's meeting: I wrongly interpreted @axic's option c) as keeping the `name`s as they are right now. I.e having:
- `{"uid": "SOL-2019-7", "name": "UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor_0.4.x", ...}`
- `{"uid": "SOL-2019-7", "name": "UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor", ...}`

This would not disrupt existing tools. But that's basically a new option d) :).

@cameel implemented option d), can you please double check the numbering?

We also have another style `YulOptimizerRedundantAssignmentBreakContinue0.5` :)

What is the year based on? I assumed the `introduced` field, but I see now that the oldest bugs do not have it.

EDIT: Though now that I think of it, `fixed` is more relevant since that's when we assign the number. So it's probably that.

It is based on me manually going through when the blog post was published or when the fix was released.

I plan to do another once over adding any missing urls and filling in the `publish` date too, but lets get this one done first.

If we were to follow a CVE-style system, the number would be assigned when a bug is confirmed, so it is not tied to the when it is actually fixed. However this would only make any difference in the edge case that something is published close to the year end and we don't manage to release a fix until the new year.

OK. I went over all of them and I can at least confirm that the year in the `uid` matches the release date of the version from `fixed` field (based on the dates from changelog). 

The only irregularity I found is that the two `SOL-2020-1` entries are not next to each other but that's just a cosmetic issue. And maybe it's actually better that way because at least the diff is easy to follow.

**UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor**, **UninitializedFunctionPointerInConstructor_0.4.x**. Are there any related solidity programs to trigger these two bugs?
