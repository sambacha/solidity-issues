# [\#11309 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11309) `merged`: Add some semantic tests using stringutils

Depends on #11110. Would like to use that interface, so we can move the entire `stringutils` directory.

`t_ubu_cli` is failing because you moved `strings.sol` out of `test/compilationTests/stringutils/` but left the directory there (it still contains `README.md` and `LICENSE`). `cmdlineTests.sh` sees the directory and tries to run tests from it (but now does not contain any).

And `t_ubu_release_soltest` fails because apparently `strings.sol` only works with ABI coder v2. `soltest_all.sh` will try to run it with v1 too unless you explicitly add the pragma in the file.

I know, that's why I said I want to get #11110 merged first so I can move the entire directory. Currently we can't do that as isoltest will try to parse the other files (README, etc).

Ah, true :) Sorry, I should have reread the description before going back to this PR.

This is probably because I return the struct in some tests. `stringutils.sol` itself does not depend on it. That is not really needed, we could remove it, but since we want to compare against the IR gas cost (where v2 is required) we should just keep it.

However... v2 is by default since 0.8.0, so why would a test fail?!

Because `soltest_all.sh` does a `soltest` run with `ABI_ENCODER_V1=1`. In this run the default is abi encoder v1 so if the file does not explicitly set v2, it must work with both to pass.

#10643 is so much nicer ðŸ˜‰ 

Will add the pragma once #11110 is merged.
