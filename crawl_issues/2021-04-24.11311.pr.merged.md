Please note that the semantics of boost remove erase if is different than ranges remove if: the former erases, the latter returns a new container with only those elements from the original container that pass the remove predicate.

For the change you wish to make to be semantically the same, you'd have to actually call erase on the original container with the output of ranges remove if as the argument.

It looks like `erase_if` performs erase + remove: https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/blob/master/include/range/v3/action/remove_if.hpp#L58

Let me double-check if it works, though.
