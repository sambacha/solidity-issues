That sounds like a great solution if it works. Are you sure that the `Disallow` will not block the `Allow` part?

The page you linked, only says this, but it's about user agent matching, not `Allow`/`Disallow` matching:

> Groups are processed from top to bottom, and a user agent can match only one rule set, which is the first, most specific rule that matches a given user agent.

@christianparpart One problem with this is that there are other paths under `/en/` and we would have to list them all. I'm not even sure what they all are. `/en/latest/` at least but probably more.

@cameel The script is updated as per our discussion.

@cameel Yeah, the requested changes was made and I replaced the `while` loop with `sed` like you mentioned.

@axic's comments reminded me about one thing: the release checklist.

@cxxboy could you remove the point about updating `robots.txt` from the checklist? It's no longer necessary that we have the script :)

Did a quick google search and some of the older versions are still showing up, but more importantly noticed paths like this:
- https://docs.soliditylang.org/_/downloads/en/v0.8.0/pdf/
- https://docs.soliditylang.org/_/downloads/en/v0.8.0/epub/
- https://docs.soliditylang.org/_/downloads/en/v0.8.0/htmlzip/

I think we need to add `Disallow: /_/downloads/en/*` and `Allow: /_/downloads/en/<version>`.

@cameel Do you mean `ReleaseChecklist.md`? In this PR, I didn't touch the release checklist file. It was on last PR(which we no longer have now) is where I did written a line about updating `robots.txt` (unless I'm mistaken something)

Oh, isn't the problem that our newly generated `robots.txt` is not included under those old published paths on readthedocs?!

https://docs.soliditylang.org/robots.txt still results in:
```
User-agent: *

Disallow: # Allow everything

Sitemap: https://ethereum-solidity.readthedocs.io/sitemap.xml
```

The newly generated robots.txts are available under https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.7.5/robots.txt for example.

We could also enable https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/versions.html#version-warning instead of this fight with robots.txt, cc @franzihei @chriseth.

Sorry, disregard the above, seems like made a typo and that text is from ethereum-solidity.readthedocs.io (who runs that btw?)

I should not do reviews this late ðŸ˜¬

I know. But we modified the checklist in #10972 so the entry is already there and needs to be removed.

@axic 
> Oh, isn't the problem that our newly generated robots.txt is not included under those old published paths on readthedocs?!

It doesn't for me. I get the new one with all versions listed. Maybe you're getting a cached version?

I think we have it already. I'm always using the banner at the top to get to the latest version when I get old results from our docs in Google :)

![solidity-docs-outdated-version-banner-0 8 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/116315670-2236d180-a7b1-11eb-9ea5-49b46f350cc8.png)

> Did a quick google search and some of the older versions are still showing up, but more importantly noticed paths like this:

I just searched for `site:solidity.readthedocs.org pragma` and I'm getting only results from `/en/latest/` (though the Google page shows old version numbers in titles but links do not lead to those old versions).

> I think we need to add `Disallow: /_/downloads/en/*` and `Allow: /_/downloads/en/<version>`.

Yeah, if you're getting that in Google then I agree, we should disallow them. @cxxboy could you add that to the template?

It is https://readthedocs.org/projects/ethereum-solidity/, and is published from a deleted github repository. Perhaps we could ask for deleting that documentation repository?

But I can confirm that normal search without `site:solidity.readthedocs.org` does show links to old versions so something is indeed wrong with the config that's being served currently.

Maybe the culprit is the missing user agent? The old `robots.txt` did not have it but the docs linked by @christianparpart say it's mandatory. That's why included it in the template I suggested in this PR and now it's there. Maybe this will fix the problem.

@axic Are you getting this in search results? I am not getting anything from under that link even if I search with `site:readthedocs.org/projects/ethereum-solidity`.

But anyway, asking for it to be deleted sounds good to me.

I'm searching for "solidity documentation".

@axic Ok, with that search I get it too. Anyway, that's a separate problem from this PR. I.e. not caused by our `robots.txt`.

I think in the longer run that robots.txt will be shorter than explictly blacklisting all prior software versions.
