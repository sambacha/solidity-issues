# [\#11319 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11319) `merged`: optimizationPreset setting in object compiler tests + refactor

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-04-26 22:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11319):

Adds a way to disable the optimizer for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10286#discussion_r618645372 + a bunch of refactors to make the implementation neater.

- Adds `OptimisationPreset` enum and `OptimiserSettings preset()` that uses it.
- Adds `TestCaseReader::enumSetting()` as a convenience helper for settings backed by enums rather than strings.
- Replaces the boolean `optimize` setting in `ObjectCompilerTest` with one that allows selecting an optimization preset.
- Switches `optimizationPreset` to `none` in those tests that assume that there is no optimization.
