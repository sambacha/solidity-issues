Rebased.

What do you mean "no test affected"?

Just figured out: we do not have cmdline tests which would show the generated code. I did see semantic tests with immutables still passing so I guess it is correct.

I wonder if we should at some point have an option in semantic or syntax tests for the IR to inject the generated code into the test case, so we can see changes easily. After all the IR should be auditable, right? ðŸ˜‰
