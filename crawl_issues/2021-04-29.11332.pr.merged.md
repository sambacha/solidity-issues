# [\#11332 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11332) `merged`: Switch from archlinux/base to archlinux:base image in CI and add a workaround for runc breakage

Our `b_archlinux` jobs in all PRs are failing (see for example [this `b_archlinux` run on `develop`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/15547/workflows/36b3b079-843a-4af6-9c6b-e933520b4a2e/jobs/705625)).

```
  image cache not found on this host, downloading archlinux/base

Error response from daemon: pull access denied for archlinux/base, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: requested access to the resource is denied
```

Looks like [`archlinux/base` image we've been using is gone](https://hub.docker.com/r/archlinux/base/).

Found a thread about it on Arch forum: [Confused about two DockerHub "archlinux" images available](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=255272). So it appears that `archlinux/base` and `archlinux:base` were two different images, but both official. There were plans to remove the former and it's probably what happened. There's `archlinux/archlinux:base` available now and I suspect it's the same as `archlinux/base` but `archlinux:base` seems to be better suited to CI (it's smaller) so in this PR I'm trying to switch us to that.

Well, looks like `archlinux:base` does not work. Same with `archlinux/archlinux:base`:
```
error: failed to initialize alpm library
(could not find or read directory: /var/lib/pacman/)
```

Apparently there was a bug in Docker's `runc` which causes this problem when the container is running newer `glibc`: [FS#69563 - core/glibc 2.33 prevents Archlinux runing under systemd-nspawn](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/69563). The problem here is that it's the host that is affected, not the container so it's not fixable on Arch's side. It won't go away until CircleCI updates its host images.

In the meantime the workaround is to use an older Arch Linux image version that still has older glibc. This seems to work even though we immediately update the system with pacman.

I checked out several tags and looks like the newest that works is `archlinux:base-20210131.0.14634`.

Looks like it's actually kernel, not docker that's the problem and CircleCI has just not updated so far: [Archlinux/pacman is broken on circleci](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/archlinux-pacman-is-broken-on-circleci/39754/2).
