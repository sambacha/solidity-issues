[Bintray](https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2021/04/251458.php) that used to host boost binaries has shut down. Boost binaries are now hosted at: https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/

This issue tracks support for updating the relevant links in the Solidity repo.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

This was actually fixed by #11370.
