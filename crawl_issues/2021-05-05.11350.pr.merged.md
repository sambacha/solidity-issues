I just rebased and resolved a lot of conflicts. Due to that I did not **yet** adapt the CLI to also know about `--lsp`` option. Will do next round.

Just opening `gnosis/Tokens/EtherToken.sol` in our repo in QtCreator creates an error because it cannot import `../Tokens/StandardToken.sol` - it tries to look inside `home/user/file:/home/user/ethereum/solidity/test/...`

@cameel Do you think it would make sense to extract a "simpler" part of FileReader into a base class and use it here?

Depends on what assumptions you can make about the client. If the goal is just not to have to deal with any normalization magic, and you can really assume that all paths you get from the client are always:
1. absolute
2. consistent (e.g. you won't randomly get `c:\project\a.sol` and `C:\PROJECT\b.sol` when files are in the same dir; or `C:\Users\ActualProjectDir\a.sol` when `C:\Project\` is actually a symlink).
3. located within a base path or an include path
4. base path and include paths are all absolute and non-empty

then I think you could move normalization completely to a derived class and have a no-op in base `FileReader`.

If you don't care about direct imports, you could even get away without (3) and (4) and have a base reader without the concept of base path and include paths at all. Or with include paths only - so that direct imports would work from include paths but not from project dir. The interesting thing is that for example Truffle does not even allow direct imports from project dir (due to the conflict with `project:/` prefix) so this might not even be a big limitation in real-life projects.

Allowed paths won't work correctly without normalization and symlink resolution that matches our assumptions but I think we don't need that with LSP. We could move that whole feature to the derived class too and have it only on the CLI.

Loading files from disk in the callback will still work without normalization as long as base path is not relative. We need normalization there only for two reasons: to deal with relative base path and for allowed paths.
