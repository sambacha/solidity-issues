For this code, it would be very useful to somehow combine `SideEffects` and `ControlFlowSideEffects`, or at least make `ControlFlowSideEffects` available for user-defined functions instead of just for builtins.

Rebased and added a feature to only ignore memory if msize is found.

You surely didn't rebase it to the head given all these conflicts displayed ðŸ˜…

About memoryguard - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11352#discussion_r710289210 - as long as the transformations here are still correct, why should we bother? Also as long as the CSE treats `memoryguard` as an opaque but deterministic function, everything should still work the same way.

Fuzzer update: No reports so far. Fuzzing via #12276 which is in draft mode at the moment. 

Would be good to get it merged in close proximity to this PR since this is a breaking change as far as the fuzzer is concerned i.e., earlier we assumed memory/storage is untouched by the optimizer and based on this we included memory/storage information in the trace.

This assumption is not valid post this PR getting merged.

The documentation for the new step is missing. It would actually be really helpful to have it at the beginning of this review :) It's pretty clear what the step is supposed to do at a high level but I'm only gradually discovering how it achieves its goal and what are its limitations.

Also the control flow based on walking the AST is really hard to follow at times. For example at first it seemed weird how `LEAVE` seems to end processing of a function definition even though it might not be at the very end of a function. At the same time `STOP`, `REVERT`, etc. have no handlers.  And it looked like the actual end of a function is not handled at all. In the end I realized that `LEAVE` just ends one branch and the base class will backtrack, that `STOP` and `REVERT` will be handled as a part of side effects and that for the function end the base class has a callback. The pieces are all there so in the end it can be understood, it just feels very disconnected and takes a lot of time to process. I think that the code would be easier to understand if it had some comments elaborating on the implicit assumptions, what is expected to run in what order and what cannot happen.

One more thing that I realized after reviewing #12272 - I think that something like `UnusedStoreEliminator` would be a better name. `RedundantStoreEliminator` is not specific enough - it would work just as well for `EqualStoreEliminator`.

created a [new PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12311) with the renamed step name because I fear that all the commenst would be closed here otherwise.

I think that only happens with external PRs. At least I put my PRs on top of others all the time and they do not get closed.

Looks like some of the things I pointed out are only fixed in #12311 so I guess I should switch to reviewing that one after all...

I changed base to the rename PR but some changes from it still show up in here. Probably needs a rebase.

Note that this step is less powerful than it could be due to the following reason:
Memory stores at the end of a function cannot be removed because we don't analyze the context in which the function is used so we mark all memory at the end of a function as potentially used.
What could improve this would be if we pull the `return` or `stop` instruction at the end of an external or public function into the function itself. Currently it is inside the dispatch routine and functions will likely not be inlined into the dispatch routine. It could help to create another function that is called from the dispatch routine and has

 - abi decode
 - call internal part of function
 - abi encode and return

This would also more nicely structure the code.

Do we want to split this into storage and memory and wait with the memory part until we have the linear solver?

That may make sense, yes - if only, s.t. it's only one of the two to think about for the first version :-). We can also see what Fe says on Monday about the entire https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11352#discussion_r779451371 discussion...
