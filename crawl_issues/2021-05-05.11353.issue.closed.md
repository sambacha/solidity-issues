I am new here. Could someone advise what CXX flags I should use so that the `std::exception::what:` will not be empty. 

Thanks.

@chengniansun Thanks for the bug report. The empty `std::exception::what` is expected. An assert (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.h#L228) fails, because that function is not expected to be called.

We also found something similar. 
#### Code
```solidity
contract C {
	mapping ( string => address ) [ 8_4E1] immutable d;
}
```
#### Environment
- Compiler version: Version: 0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2.Linux.g++
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- OS: docker image ethereum/solc:0.8.4

#### Output
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:

This should result in `Error: Type containing a (nested) mapping is not allowed as event parameter type.`

> ```solidity
> contract C {
> 	mapping ( string => address ) [ 8_4E1] immutable d;
> }
> ```

And this should be `Error: Immutable variables cannot have a non-value type.`

Both cases are disallowed for different reasons but both seem to trigger the same error. The problem is that `MappingType` does not override `calldataEncodedSize()` apparently with the assumption that it's never needed. That turns out not to be the case.

This is slightly related to #8382, though it's not the same problem.

I think whenever you call `calldataEncodedSize` on mapping, it should be an error, because the concept does not exist. When this assertion is triggered, it means a non-fatal error should be turned into a fatal error or the caller should first check if the type is valid in calldata.
