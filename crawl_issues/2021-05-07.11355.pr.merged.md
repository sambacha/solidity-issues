# [\#11355 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11355) `merged`: Remove import of ranges namespace.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-05-07 11:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11355):

``ranges`` generally conflicts with ``std``, so since we import ``std`` we should **never** import ``ranges`` in *any* source file.
Doing so will cause random issues, even if it seems to work at first. Once any unrelated common header, e.g. ``CommonData.h`` or the like, wants to include any `ranges` functionality that has a counterpart in `std` used in that source file, things will break.

Damn it, this was not the only place (I just changed the one that caused breakage for me assuming that that was the first time this was done).
I'll go ahead and remove all of others in a new PR.
