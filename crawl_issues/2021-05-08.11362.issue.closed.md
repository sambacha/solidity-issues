# [\#11362 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11362) `closed`: Unused parameter warning is unnecessary when the parameter is used in a virtual function's NatSpec
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

When a function parameter is not used, Solidity compiler gives a warning. This warning can be suppressed by removing the variable name, but if this variable is used in the function's NatSpec, that will produce an Error:
```
DocstringParsingError: Documented parameter "token" not found in the parameter list of the function.
```
For a virtual function which is supposed to be overridden its quite normal to have unused parameters which is also included in the NatSpec documentation.

Thanks for submitting this issue! Can you please provide example code to clarify any misunderstandings? For example, do you think it is makes a difference if the virtual function has a body or not?

This is the code:
https://github.com/aybehrouz/ADAGs/blob/main/contracts/utils/Administered.sol
It's a utility contract which is used for adding the ability to recover trapped tokens in a contract. The default implementation for `canControl` function is retruning `false` which does not use the function's parameter.

At the end, I used an empty  ` `` ` to prevent the NatSpec related error. But the NatSpec description looks a bit awkward now.

This is a tricky problem, since we do want the warning if the parameter is just used via natspec but not in the code.
Maybe adding code that does `address(_contract);` can be used to disable the warning?

something like this?
```solidity
    function canControl(IERC20 _contract) public view virtual returns (bool) {
        address(_contract);
        return false;
    }
```

I should add that the current source code does not produce any errors or warnings. I think the empty ` `` ` is a better work around maybe.

Why is this?

Here's a real world example:

```solidity
/**
 * @param token The token to be flash loaned.
 */
function _flashFeeReceiver(address token) internal view virtual returns (address) {
    return address(0);
}
```

We're forced to introduce a statement like `token;` in the function body to silence the warning. Removing the variable name is not an option because then you can't provide NatSpec for it.

If the function is virtual I think the warning should be silenced, particularly if there is an `@param` for it, because the workaround is hacky and requires a comment explaining why it's there.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

For the record you can suppress both compiler and natspec warnings with `{...}` in the natpec `@param` line:

```
    /**
     * @notice ...
     * @param {_from} The address from which tokens are being transferred.
     * @param _to The address to which tokens are being transferred.
     * @param {_amount} The amount of tokens being transferred.
     */
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address, address _to, uint256) internal view override {
        if (SANCTIONS_LIST.isSanctioned(_to)) revert SanctionedAddress();
    }
```

This effectively solves the warning, but `dodoc`  won't recognize the name of the parameter anymore :disappointed:
