To avoid problems like #11358 we should make the bytecode check script (#10838) cross-platform and start running the check on Windows binaries as well.

In #10838 I added a bytecode check for old releases in solc-bin. The goal was to verify the rebuilt macOS binaries. I thought it would be a waste not to reuse in some way it so I also hooked it up as a PR check for newly added binaries but this was just a low priority side-task and spending more time to get it to run on Windows as well did not seem like a good idea. It's a bash script so it will likely not run out of the box on Windows, though we could try our luck with `bash.exe`. A more robust alternative would be to rewrite it in Python.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
