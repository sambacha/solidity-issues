```solidity
contract MetaTest {

    struct Metadata {
        bool flag;
        uint256[] ids;
    }

    Metadata public meta;

}
```

The above code is missing an error.

On the other hand,

```solidity
contract MetaTest {

    struct Metadata {
        uint256[] ids;
    }

    Metadata public meta;

}
```

has the correct error:

```
Error: Internal or recursive type is not allowed for public state variables.
 --> <stdin>:7:2:
  |
7 | 	Metadata public meta;
  | 	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

The type is not recursive though

This is not a bug per se, but the error description could be better. The way getter functions are generated from types is a bit weird, which leads to this problem.

Could someone explain what the rule is here? The example errors out with a static or dynamic array but other types like `bytes`, `string`, external function pointer, struct or `mapping` do not. This limitation is not documented anywhere as far as I can tell. Why is it even forbidden for some array types? I'd think this has something to do with them being reference types but nested structs and even strings do work.

I think they get skipped. 

My guess is that, we get an error if the struct ends up being empty after we skip all these non-encodable types. In the other cases, it's fine.

Oh. Why do we skip them though? I get mappings but `uint256[]` is not a storage-only type.
