How is this different from the other PR?

> How is this different from the other PR?

It's not really. I'm just building the docker images here separately to get the new hashes to be used in the other PR.
It's not really possible to both build and use new docker images in the same PR: I only know the docker image hashes after the docker builds went through, but if I then use the same PR to update the hashes in the CircleCI config, the image builds are triggered again. One could cancel those new builds, but it's easier to just use two PRs, especially if the change to the docker images doesn't break solc builds.

I understand that we need to merge separately, that was discussed already :wink:

Then I don't understand the problem :-).
In any case, let's just wait for the images here to be built, then I can have a look at them and if and where evmone ends up in them.

The "problem" I guess is that we are just keep rebuilding the images and not investigating why the built evmone lib is not visible to soltest ðŸ¤·

I *will* investigate that with the new images here :-). I'm also updating the boost download links here, so we needed newly built images anyways.

Hm... it seems to end up in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libevmone.so
Which makes sense, but that's not in our search path... and it's not so nice to add it by hard-coding, since it's platform specific...
