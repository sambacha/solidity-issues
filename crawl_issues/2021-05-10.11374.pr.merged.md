Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11286

@axic so something like this maybe?

So as an explanation for potential reviewers that are not @axic ;-):

There are two things happening here:
- In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11286, @axic noticed that a failure to load evmone just led to silently skipping the semantics tests in the test suite - that's of course problematic and it's safer to require an explicit option to disable them. We could do this only for `soltest`, but I'd argue having `isoltest` behave as similar to `soltest` as possible is good, so this PR changes this for both.

- The default install path for evmc as installed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11286, resp. the docker images in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11372 is `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`, which is not in our hard-coded search path. While we could change the install directory for our docker images, it's nicer if we can load a system-installed evmone from its default path. To that end, I'm changing the logic for finding evmone (and similarly hera) to the following:
  - If the environment variable ``ETH_EVMONE`` is set, use it directly and expect it to point to a valid libevmone.so.
  - If there is a ``libevmone.so`` in the working tree as per our heuristics (look in ``deps/``, ``deps/libs`` and the same up to two directories downwards ``..``), then use that one.
  - If not the evmone path is set to plainly ``libevmone.so``, which will have the evmc loader (which uses ``dlopen``) default to the system-wide search paths for libraries, which includes ``/usr/lib``, possibly (if user-desired) ``/usr/local/lib`` and/or ``/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/``.

Note that evmc internally verifies that the found ``libevmone.so`` is ABI-compatible with the desired version (we should probably still try to load an so-versioned library first, but if we want to do that, we can still do so separately from this PR).

As discussed in chat: merging now, but it might be nice to improve the remaining comments separately.
