# [\#11377 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11377) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Assign cast from constants directly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-05-11 12:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11377):

Currently something like `bytes8(0)` would compute bitvector operations to assign the constant, even though it could be assigned directly. This PR adds code that shortcuts casts from constants, removing the more complicated bv operations. The operation is safe without extra checks since the TypeChecker guarantees that a constant fits the cast size at that point.

There are tests already, the main reason I'm doing this is so we can run Eldarica on more tests since it doesn't support BV

Yeah, I would have guessed so, just making sure you're saying there are enough tests for this already.
