There are known non-determinism problems with ``yulOptimizerTests/reasoningBasedSimplifier/addmod``, even with a matching version of Z3.
While they are "mostly harmless" to us, this is causing issues for package maintainers, see https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/122568.

If we can't solve the non-determinism, we should probably either remove the test or introduce a new boost test label like "experimental" that allows to disable tests with issues like that in bulk, the idea being that not having those tests pass is ok for a production build of solidity.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
