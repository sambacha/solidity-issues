# [\#11383 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11383) `merged`: Add missing blogpost to the buglist

And also change the old blog.ethereum.org links to blog.soliditylang.org. The blog posts also link back to the original blog.ethereum.org post, so it goes full circle :wink:

> Do we also have blog posts for SOL-2020-9 and earlier?

I went through manually the blog (the security advisory label) and everything is now included in `bugs.json` with this PR. Other bugs (low severity ones mostly) don't have a blog post.
