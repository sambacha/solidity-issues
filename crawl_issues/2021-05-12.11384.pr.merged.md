# [\#11384 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11384) `merged`: Expose TemporaryDirectory helper

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-05-12 16:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11384):

This is a simple refactor extracted from the upcoming `FileReader` refactor. This PR basically does two things:
- Moves the `TemporaryDirectory` helper I created for `yul-phaser` into a better spot to make it more generally available. I don't see any specific directory for test helpers so I placed it directly in `test/`.
- Refactors `TemporaryDirectory` not to hide the fact that it uses `boost::filesystem`. Originally I considered it an implementation detail but it actually hinders interoperability with the rest of our code.

It's best to review commits separately since the first, bigger one just moves code around and the actual changes to the implementation (second) commit are relatively small.
