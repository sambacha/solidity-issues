# [\#11385 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11385) `merged`: TemporaryWorkingDirectory helper

Depends on #11384. Marked as draft until the dependency gets merged.

This PR adds a very simple `TemporaryWorkingDirectory` test helper that lets you change working directory in a test without risking the change being permanent and affecting other tests. If your test crashes, the object ensures upon destruction that the directory gets changed back.

I solved the CI problems so this is now ready for review.

The issue was that the path to a tmp dir I was receiving on macOS was through a symlink. I was using that path to change directory but then, upon asking what the current directory is I was getting canonical path and the comparison in a test was failing. Switching to `boost::filesystem::equivalent()` for path comparison solved the problem.
