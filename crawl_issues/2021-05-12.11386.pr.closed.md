# [\#11386 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11386) `closed`: FileReader unit tests and refactor

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-05-12 16:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11386):

This is a continuation of #11113.
Depends on #11385. Marked as draft until the dependency gets merged.

This PR adds some tweaks that we discussed after #11113 got merged. In particular https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11113#discussion_r608442183 but also a few other tiny changes.

More importantly, it extracts the path<->source unit name conversions and checks into `toSourceUnitName()`, `fromSourceUnitName()`, `inAllowedDirectory()`, `allowParentDirectory()` methods and covers it with unit tests. That logic is currently pretty trivial but and that's only because we completely rely on how boost does things. There are actually a lot of corner cases and we need those covered because we'll be changing the behavior and it's hard to keep track of what we're actually changing without good test coverage.

This PR only covers `FileReader`. There'll be another one with coverage for `ImportRemapper`.

The PR is failing because apparently I did introduce some unintended changes to how `--allow-paths` works.

Actually, I'm not really satisfied with how these unit tests turned out. They are bulky and still cover only a small part inside the `FileReader` so things like this easily slip through. Some of the logic, like the allowed path processing, is still in `CommandLineInterface`. I don't really want to move that logic to `FileReader` either because it does belong in `CommandLineInterface` - it's part of the input parsing which is exactly its job. I'd really prefer to be able to test the whole code path from an invocation like `solc a.sol --base-path x/ --allowed-paths /a,b,c/d` to loading a file from disk. The problem is that `CommandLineInterface` is not testable at all.

To fix this today I made a small refactor to extract argument parsing into a separate class, which was surprisingly not that hard - I'm already almost done with it and I'll submit it as a separate PR. This will finally make the CLI options testable and will allow me to get some actual coverage of the path processing part, which I'd really like to have before I start shuffling code around.

@cameel can you bring this one here up-to-date?

I'm closing it since there's no point rebasing it on my other PRs now. Most of the tests were already incorporeted into path and CLI refactor PR. For `FileReader` there's a bunch of minor cleanup here that I'm going to resubmit once the path PRs are merged.
