# [\#11388 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11388) `merged`: Fix comparison of bit shifts (unchecked overflow) to arithmetic (checked overflow)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382183?u=499298f335f6f4f2b2498c3510275590dd8e67fc&v=4" width="50">[fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) opened issue at [2021-05-12 20:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11388):

I consider this to be a security issue because somebody faithfully reading the documentation could deploy a contract where they expect something to revert, when in fact it does not. A malicious actor could perform an unchecked-input attack to get a contract into undefined behavior.

# Test case

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

pragma solidity 0.8.4;

contract OverflowCheck {
    function arithmeticOverflow() external {
        uint256 a = 100;
        uint256 b = a * 2**255;
    }
    
    function shiftOverflow() external {
        uint256 a = 100;
        uint256 b = a << 255;
    }
}
```

# Expected outcome

According to current documentation:

> For positive and negative x values, x << y is equivalent to x * 2**y.

# Actual outcome

`x * 2**y` causes a revert and `x << y` does not.

# Recommendations

I think the current implementation is reasonable, and the documentation should be updated.

Release a new version of Solidity include zero code changes, but including this documentation change. The documentation is part of the release!

Reported to the Ethereum bounty program at https://bounty.ethereum.org. I'm not sure what that does, but please do vote/approve, etc. over there.

I'll squash the commits now.

Will discuss about the security part on Wednesday. I'll keep it as draft until then.

We disagree here.

My opinion is that if:

1. The documentation contains an inaccurate statement; and
2. Depending on that statement can cost somebody USD 1 trillion,

then that is a security issue.

But either way, we are all agreed on the fixes here.

Simplified this a lot - is that a good idea?
