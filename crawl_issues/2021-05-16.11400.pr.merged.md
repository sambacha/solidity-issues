# [\#11400 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11400) `merged`: SMTChecker: Fix struct constructor where fixed-bytes member is initialized with a string literal

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2021-05-16 11:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11400):

Fixes #11336.

The crash happened because `SMTEncoder::visitStructConstructorCall` did not take the possible conversion from String literal to fixed-bytes into account.

The added test case simplifies the one from issue a bit (the array is unnecessary, the crash happened also without it) and adds assertions.

A rebase should fix the CI issues.
