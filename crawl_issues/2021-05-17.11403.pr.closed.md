factor out some parsing/configuration API to be able to use them at other places too.

This refactoring is needed in order to share some code bits with the LSP PR to avoid code duplication.

It might be better to keep the interface of StandardCompiler trivial and instead introduce something like StandardCompilerSettings that performs the json parsing and so on and which can be accessed also from the LSP. What do you think? StandardCompiler.cpp is gigantic and probably deserves a split.

> @christianparpart Are you working on this one?

just saw you now. sorry. yes. Since it's just an extraction from the lsp pr. I'll recreate this PR as it's easier than redoing all the change-work already applied on the other side.
