This fixes the asan failure in our nightly CI run (https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/15942/workflows/abd0c9b1-22d9-4190-ac7f-2a396d82cb1e/jobs/721523). Or at least the one I managed to reproduce locally (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11406#issuecomment-844397471).

The issue was caused by the fact that `TestFileParser` stores a `const` reference to a `map` of builtins rather than a copy. It was being passed a temporary which resulted in a dangling reference.

Actually, looks like the problem is real. Failing tests just made me realize that `TestFileParser` does not really store builtins - it only holds a reference. So we have builtins actually going out of scope here.

Switching to draft for now and I'm going to update it in a moment.

Nice catch!
