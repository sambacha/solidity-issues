# [\#11420 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11420) `merged`: [DOCS] Sphinx 4.x.y compatibility fixes

Depends on #11565.

Sphinx 4.0.0 has been released recently and deprecated some of the older features. Now `scripts/docs.sh` fails for me locally on that version. This PR adds some minor tweaks to make our docs work with both Sphinx 3 and Sphinx 4:
- `add_stylesheet()` has long been deprecated. `add_css_file()` is the replacement (https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/7747). This has exposed a bug in our lexer. See details below.
- `add_lexer()` used to accept both a class and an instance. Starting with Sphinx 4 it only accepts a lexer class.
- We did have some non-Solidity snippets using Solidity highlighting that started failing due to the lexer change mentioned above. I changed their highlighting to the correct one.
- I added `robots.txt` to `.gitignore`. This is unrelated to Sphinx update and should have been done in #11317.

### Bug in `pygments-lexer-solidity`
[`add_lexer()` has a weird quirk](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/6497#issuecomment-506922270):
- When it gets an instance of the lexer, syntax errors are ignored and snippets with errors still get highlighted (the error just gets a red outline)
- When it gets a class, syntax errors result in a warning on the command-line (`WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as "Solidity". Highlighting skipped.`) and highlighting is completely disabled for the buggy code snippet.

This has exposed a bug in [pygments-lexer-solidity](https://gitlab.com/veox/pygments-lexer-solidity). The lexer apparently has problems handling `assembly` blocks that are followed by other Solidity instructions (but extra instructions before them are fine). Note for example [the red outline in one of the examples in our current docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/solidity-by-example.html#the-full-contract):

![solidity-by-example-lexer-error-after-assembly-block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/119037790-b4965380-b9b2-11eb-8d2d-167f07cb6215.png)

The error goes away only if I remove the `return` statement or the `assembly` block. We have 3 snippets like this. The snippets look fine to me and do compile so it must be a bug in the lexer rather than in the snippet.

~I originally wanted to use the `:force:` option of the [`code-block`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-code-block) directive to suppress these errors until the lexer is fixed. But it turns out that switching from `::` to `code-block` was enough to suppress them.~ **EDIT**: Weird, it only works locally. I did need `:force:` to make it build in CI.

This needs more work. Looks like `isolate_tests.py` treats the `:force:` option as a part of the snippet.

Looks good, but I think the test extractor needs to be updated.

Extractor fixed in #11565. This PR is now based on it. I'll mark it as reviewable once the dependency is merged.
