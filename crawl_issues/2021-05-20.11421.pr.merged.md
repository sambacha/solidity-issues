# [\#11421 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11421) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Solver option

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11289

This PR introduces an option to allow the user to choose the solver they want to run. This is expected to not be used that much, but it's important for SMTChecker runs via the JS callback. That is needed, for example, to run the SMTChecker with other Horn solvers, for example Eldarica which I have been experimenting with.
In the current form, since we have static z3 inside soljson, z3 always runs and the CHC queries are not reported. After this PR, if the chosen solver is `smtlib2`, the queries will be output (for the callback) even if z3 is available statically. This is basically the goal here.

The refactoring of the solc-js SMTChecker tests https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/524 depends on this PR, so we point to that PR here.

This needs to install latest z3 binaries for CI when running `t_ems_solcjs`.

Need to install a newer z3

Latest development: all the code and tests are ready to be reviewed. The solc-js tests need a newer z3 binary installed to pass, since I changed the circleci script to install it but it's too old on Debian.

> Looks good. Did solc-js already support this smt2lib callback?

@hrkrshnn Ah, forgot to answer this. Yea solc-js already supports this, but the queries themselves were broken before the last merged PR.

I applied the review suggestions.

Open problems:
- `t_ems_solcjs`: I changed the docker image so that the solcjs tests have a z3 binary in the system and use that for the tests, but doing so kills the job as z3 runs oom in one of the tests.
- `t_osx_cli`: the CLI SMTChecker tests as they are require cvc4 to be available in the compiler (to try different solvers at different times), but installing cvc4 on osx seems to time out on circle CI. One option would be to make this work somehow, or to remove cvc4 from all CLI tests and remove the tests accordingly.

The solc-js tests with tests for external calls, invariants and loops look good, takes 4 min which is a good amount.

Can just squash everything at the end

Changed the error message and squashed.
