# [\#11422 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11422) `closed`: Simplify add_compile_options in CMake

This PR goes back to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10359#discussion_r529008431.

The problem was described by @ekpyron at https://github.com/ethereum/cable/issues/15, and an improved version/solution was added here https://github.com/wasmx/fizzy/pull/770.

It seems to simplify our CMake configuration quite a bit, but it won't really make any difference, so it is not all that important to merge. The motivation was to resolve that old conversation in one way or another.
