 I think we need to support all possible kinds of bytecode's. 

e.g. `ir`, `irOptimized`, `legacy` and `legacyOptimized`. Maybe also `wast`, `ewasm` and `ewasm.wast`?

@axic what do you think?

I guess that is true. I would ignore wasm for now. At the same time, cannot we say that `bytecode` remains as an option which must satisfy ir, irOptimized, legacy and legacyOptimized? If so, we can add the other kinds later when the need arises.

Still waiting for update I guess?

Is this still wanted?

This is marked as `takeover` but hasn't been active for a year, so I'm closing for now. Code is still available in the branch to whoever takes over.
