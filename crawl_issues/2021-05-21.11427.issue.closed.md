This would increase readability in bigger tests, such as those in `semanticTests/externalContracts`.

```
// -- Double reserve
// account: 1
// reserve(string), 69 ether: 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
// owner(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" -> 0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012
// account: 0
// -- Transfer
// setContent(string,bytes32): 0x40, 0, 3, "abc" ->
// transfer(string,address): 0x40, 555, 3, "abc" ->
// owner(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
// content(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
```

The proposed syntax is `-- text`. Note that there is already `# test #` as a syntax which works at some places and not others. It would be fine making that work properly on new lines too.

`--` looks good to me. Something like `#` or `##` would look more like a comment but stands out less:

```
// ## Double reserve
// account: 1
// reserve(string), 69 ether: 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
// owner(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" -> 0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012
// account: 0
// ## Transfer
// setContent(string,bytes32): 0x40, 0, 3, "abc" ->
// transfer(string,address): 0x40, 555, 3, "abc" ->
// owner(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
// content(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
```

Something that would help even more would be ability to add empty lines:
```
// -- Double reserve
// account: 1
// reserve(string), 69 ether: 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
// owner(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" -> 0x1212121212121212121212121212120000000012
// account: 0
//
// -- Transfer
// setContent(string,bytes32): 0x40, 0, 3, "abc" ->
// transfer(string,address): 0x40, 555, 3, "abc" ->
// owner(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
// content(string): 0x20, 3, "abc" ->
```

Yes, in my example branch (#11426) I used empty lines, but removed them since.

Having just reviewed it, I think it would have been easier with those empty lines :)

My motivation exactly ðŸ˜…  It is a pain dealing with that currently.

Cameel that's a good catch with the empty lines...the empty lines actually helps. It makes it easier and a lot more readable.

Regarding ease of implementation, I think `// @: "My comment"` could be very easily supported with the hook system by @aarlt, but actual empty lines is a much bigger change in both the parser and printer.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
