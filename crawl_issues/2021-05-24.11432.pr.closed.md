# [\#11432 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11432) `closed`: Return panic code for ether sent to non-payable functions

We still have a lot of cases (especially in the ABIEncoderV2) where we output debug revert strings (which are stripped by an option). I was wondering why don't we keep using the panic system instead, so did it with one case just to see the gas implications.

In most cases it gives a gas reduction, but unfortunately due to the way `appendConditionalPanic` in the legacy codegen works, it is also inserted verbatim and is not deduplicated, resulting in quite an increase. Still opening this so we can debate.

At least the per-transaction increase is very small now, after #11433.
