Some of old gas tests need updates, as well as cli tests. Apart from that, looks good

Looks good! Not sure why I did not use `callYulFunction` there...

Seems like it needs more updates to tests

Need to fix the ExpressionCompiler tests to use yul util functions, @chriseth do you have any hunch how to do it nicely?

Implemented the ExpressionCompiler change, can squash the two update tests commits, but lets first confirm if everything is correct and we want this change.

Some tests still need updates

Fixed (forgot to run it with the optimizer) and also extended the ExpressionCompiler test to support it. @chriseth I want to squash these before merge, but please review.

Not sure why the `ExpressionCompiler/arithmetic` test fails on Ubuntu, it works on macOS (on CI and locally).
