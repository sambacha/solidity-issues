# [\#11437 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11437) `closed`: Divide transaction gas fee

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35201155?v=4" width="50">[kayafurkan8](https://github.com/kayafurkan8) opened issue at [2021-05-25 13:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11437):

function x(uint256 _value) public {
        limit += _value;
        if(limit >= 5){
            myMethod();
            limit = 0;
        }
    }
    
I have a method like that(x function). if limit is smaller then 5 everything is OK but the last caller (for example contract has 3 and he will send 2-3 value) it will continue to if statement and it will run myMethod(); so the last caller should pay more gas then other callers.
myMethod(); is calling another method from another contract with importing and giving contract address.

I want to if the code will continue to if statement I want to pay gas fee of myMethod(); Is it possible?
function x(uint256 _value) public {
        limit += _value;
        if(limit >= 5){
            msg.sender = address(this); // or msg.sender = owner;
            myMethod();
            limit = 0;
        }
    }
 
Or can I create automatic function without call on the contract. Directly :
if(limit>=5){
     myMethod();
}
Without method directly call on contract //I know it is not possible but is there any diffrent method for that?
