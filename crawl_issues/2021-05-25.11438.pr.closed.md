# [\#11438 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11438) `closed`: Use string::starts_with()

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2021-05-25 15:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11438):

It makes more sense to use `string::starts_with()` rather than `string::find()`

> Looks good as long as it passes CI but unfortunately I think it won't. `starts_with()` is a C++20 extension and we still support C++17.

I see ... well I better close this PR then ðŸ˜ž

I know, I just saw an open issue of somebody trying to replace some boost functions with the STL equivalents. I'll open a new PR with more changes if necessary. For now I keep this PR closed.

If you're looking for an issue to contribute, maybe you'd like to try #10269?
