@aarlt has pointed out that the [docs on ABI encoding of events](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/abi-spec.html#events) say

> If the event is declared as anonymous the `topics[0]` is not generated;

This could be taken to mean that `topic[0]` is left empty in that case. I think it just does not contain the signature but it can still contain one of the indexed parameters. Not sure if the first one or the fourth one when it's there (both would make sense). I need to check that and clarify that part too.

Yes, I did not understand the section correctly. When I read in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/abi-spec.html#events

- topics[0]: keccak(EVENT_NAME+"("+EVENT_ARGS.map(canonical_type_of).join(",")+")") (canonical_type_of is a function that simply returns the canonical type of a given argument, e.g. for uint indexed foo, it would return uint256). If the event is declared as anonymous the topics[0] is not generated;
- topics[n]: abi_encode(EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS[n - 1]) (EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS is the series of EVENT_ARGS that are indexed);

I understood it like `topics[0]` is only filled, when a non-anonymous event is used. And that the indexed topics are stored from `topics[1]` on - because if I use the specification `topics[n]: abi_encode(EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS[n - 1]) ` would be for `topic[0]`, `abi_encode(EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS[-1])` that don't made sense for me. So I thought that it is only valid for `n>0`. e.g. `topics[1] = EVENT_INDEXED_ARGS[0]`.

@cameel Thanks for your awesome reviews!

This is ready for another review.

I checked how the topic slots are filled for anonymous events and based on [this part in the IR codegen](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/aec20f0038e6a0053855a702e1d2c47dcc0bf2b3/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp#L980-L1018) I see that the first topic is inserted at position 0 (rather than 1), the second topic at position 1 (rather than 2) and so on. I have adjusted the ABI docs to be clearer about it.
