@haltman-at @yann300 This is a fix for #11440 but might have other consequences.

We never set the source location of a block itself, only of the statements inside the block. The only code that this could be relevant is the POPs for cleaning up local variables in the stack. This might also create source locations for the body of a function, though, which means that some POPs at the end of a function do not point to the function definition anymore but to the function body. This could also have similar consequences for any statement that contains a block like an if statement, while loop, for loop etc.

It would be great if you could check if everything still works for you.

Tests need update

I haven't tested this but don't expect it to cause any problems for us?  If you really want me to test it the easiest way would be if there's a soljson.  (I can try building solc from source later but I ran into some problems with that last time I tried it.)  Still, I'm not sure how much testing this really needs wrt Truffle... Truffle Debugger should be perfectly fine with `POP`s at the end of a function pointing to the body rather than the definition.

@haltman-at sounds good, here's a link to this PR's soljson: https://728857-40892817-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/soljson.js

OK, tested it to be sure, all tests passing.  (OK, one test failing, but that's due to an unrelated matter. :P )  No problems as expected.  Didn't try making any new tests but I think our existing tests probably would have caught it were there a problem.

This build is also working ok in our side, we do have some issue but not related.

After the fix, there is no change in commandline tests. I'll try to see if I can add a test for the specific issue.

Added a test.
