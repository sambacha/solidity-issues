# [\#11442 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11442) `merged`: Path resolution docs (current state only) v2

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-05-26 10:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11442):

Replaces #11263 and #11105.
Related to #11138, #11036 and #9353.

This PR contains the parts of #11263 that are suitable for inclusion in the docs. I removed most of the examples and focused on laying out the rules. Some parts were also rewritten to make sense without the examples - for example the rules for relative imports are now stated more explicitly.

I have just pushed an update. Most of the intro to the section about remappings has been rewritten. I think that addresses all the review commments.

For reference, I found the first version of the remapping docs: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/348
This sheds some light on how they were originally intended to be used.

Added fixes for two of @chriseth's comments.

I also squashed the fixups to make it ready for merge.
