# [\#11445 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11445) `closed`: ICE when calling an unimplemented virtual function via super
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

## Description

Trying to call super in a contract with multiple inheritance throws an InternalCompilerError with no message. 
In my case, it appeared when overriding a function of a parent class and implemented interface and then calling super on that same function. 

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.1 (also appears at least on 0.8.4 and 0.6.1)
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): istanbul
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Both Truffle and Remix show this behaviour
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: n.a.
- Operating system: Win10

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.1;
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

contract A{
    function x() public virtual {
    }
}

interface I{
    function x() external;
}

contract B is A, I{
    
    function x() override(A, I) public {
        super.x();
    }
    
}
```

Compiler error occurs when compiling above Source code. 
Although using super in this case is definitely not best-practice, I think there should be error message which helps identify the source (searched for 4 hours myself).

Thanks for the report! I can confirm that this still happens on 0.8.4 and affects the new codegen too:
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp(1948): Throw in function virtual void solidity::frontend::IRGeneratorForStatements::endVisit(const solidity::frontend::MemberAccess&)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what:
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] =
```

The problem appears to be not the multiple inheritance by itself but the fact that `I.x()` (which has no implementation) comes before `A.x()` in the [C3 linearization order](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#index-21). The code generator tries to replace `super.x()` with a call to it and fails because of the missing definition. I think it should be skipped and `A.x()` should be called in its place.

By the way, if you need a workaround for this bug, it's enough to change the order in which `B` inherits from other contracts. If you change it to `B is I, A`, the code will compile.

I have a fix that modifies `resolveVirtual()` to skip unimplemented functions but after some experimenting with this I think that this case should produce an error after all. `super.x()` is just a kind of magic so as a user maybe I'd expect it to skip the unimplemented method but this would be forbidden I just called `I.x()` directly:

```solidity
contract A {
    function x() public virtual {}
}

interface I {
    function x() external;
}

contract B is A, I {
    function x() override(A, I) public {
        I.x();
    }
}
```
```
Error: Cannot call unimplemented base function.
  --> test.sol:11:9:
   |
11 |         I.x();
   |
```

Also, I'm not sure if it even makes sense to allow this kind of inheritance at all. It would not be possible if we "straightened" the hierarchy:

```solidity
contract A {
    function x() public virtual {}
}

abstract contract I is A {
    function x() public virtual override;
}

contract B is I {
    function x() override public {
        super.x();
    }
}
```
```
Error: Overriding an implemented function with an unimplemented function is not allowed.
 --> test.sol:6:5:
  |
6 |     function x() public virtual override;
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Overridden function is here:
 --> test.sol:2:5:
  |
2 |     function x() public virtual {}
  | 
```
Maybe it would be better to require anything that explicitly provides an unimplemented virtual function to be listed before anything that overrides it?

This would be a breaking change though.

Discussed with @chriseth on gitter:

> of course the super in the end can resolve to a different function that overrides the unimplemented function
> but the condition should be that it can always resolve to something
> i.e. there must be at least one implemented function above the current one
> so in short: I think it should just skip unimplemented functions (unless they are themselves overridden by another function)

In that case I will submit the fix for `resolveVirtual()` that I already have.
