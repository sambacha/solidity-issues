# [\#11450 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11450) `merged`: Adding origin location notation to IR

I want to do these origin locations step by stem with smaller PRs
So, the first one is the simplest one. It will just add `/// @origin ...` notation to the generated yul IR

I think it would also be helpful to have locations above the statement level.

Furthermore, I'm still not so sure about the naming of "origin".

How about `solLocation`?

I think IRGenerator needs to be modified to also emit source location annotations for the larger structures.

For the record: This won't be part of this PR

Updated.

Don't be intimidated by the size of the diff. 95% of this is just replacing `m_code` with `emitCode()` as well as the test changes.
What basically was done here:

* Make `sourceIndinces` available in `IRGenerationContext`, taken from `CompilerStack`
* Use `emitCode()` instead of `m_code` in `IRGeneratorForStatements`. The function simply emits the location whenever it's different from the last one.
* one change in a yul template to prevent an extra blank line following the source location in the code output.

Something I stumbled upon:

do we want source location on both, the inner and outer yul functions?
```
            /// @src 0:292,364
            function fun_f2_41() -> var__32 {
                /// @src 0:324,327
                let zero_t_int256_4 := zero_value_for_split_t_int256()
                var__32 := zero_t_int256_4

                var__32 := modifier_m_30(var__32)
            }
            // No src here..
            function fun_f2_41_inner(_8) -> var__32 {
            [.....]
```

@Marenz can you please make sure that source locations "revert" to the fulll contract at the point where we switch from user-defined functions to utility functions?

Can you check that source locations for nested blocks are set properly? I.e. that in
```
uint x;
{ { { x = 2  } } }
```
this translates into yul blocks (does it?) and all source locations of the inner blocks actually appear in the IR?

```
uint x;
{ { { x = 2  } } }
```
currently translates to
```
            function fun_t_82() {

                /// @src 0:545,551
                let var_x_72
                let zero_t_uint256_1 := zero_value_for_split_t_uint256()
                var_x_72 := zero_t_uint256_1
                /// @src 0:565,566
                let expr_75 := 0x02
                /// @src 0:561,566
                let _2 := convert_t_rational_2_by_1_to_t_uint256(expr_75)
                var_x_72 := _2
                let expr_76 := _2

            }
```

So it seems the blocks are removed?

For the helper functions, we could actually also use the source references to the "generated sources" - I have to check how we wanted to handle that for IR.

But maybe let's leave proper source locations for helper functions out of scope of this PR, if it's too complicated.

Ok, maybe to simplify this PR and get it merged, disregard the complications with source locations outside of functions for now. I.e. only put source locations at statement level inside blocks. For a function, the first source location would be on the first line of its body. Then we don't have to deal with the complications with helper functions. Does that make sense?

I think it would be enough to just not handle the utility functions for now. The things in IRGen seemed pretty straight forward, no?, basically skip the third commit?

Maybe `IRGenerator::dispatchRoutine` should already assign the location of the function inside the case?

I think in the end the mechanism (that is already there) in IRGeneratorForStatements does not really work. We might need a `push`/`pop` mechanism as in the old codegen, but we can do that in a subsequent PR.

Or actually it might work because we use "endVisit" mostly everywhere. The following functions need to reset the source location after they have visited inner nodes:
 - IRGeneratorForStatements::evaluateExpression
 - IRGeneratorForStatements::visit(TryStatement) (after `handleCatch`)
 
The following functions needs some more `setLocation` calls:
 - IRGeneratorForStatements::handleCatch
 - IRGeneratorForStatements::handleCatchFallback

The `setLocation` call in the following functions should be removed:
 - void IRGeneratorForStatements::handleVariableReference
