# [\#11451 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11451) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Report contract invariants

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-05-28 17:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11451):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10787

Spacer already gives invariants for every predicate when the result of a query is unsat, that's the interpretation of each predicate.
If we take those expressions for our `interface_*` and `nondet_interface_*` predicates, we have respectively, contract invariants (over a state) and reentrancy properties (over a transition).
So what we do here is
- collect the `z3::expr` that represents the invariants (a big conjunction)
- translate that into `smtutil::Expression`
- collect the contract invariants above
- format them in an almost-Solidity way

Open questions:
- How do we report the found invariants? Imo it doesn't make sense to report them as warnings. For the JSON output, we can have a new object, but what about CLI?
- Should we report only contract invariants or the reentrancy invariants too? The latter has not obvious semantics, so maybe requires a different output, separated from the contract invariants.

TODO:
- [x] Docs
- [x] CLI tests
- [x] Organize the code a bit better
- [x] Format ABI functions better https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11463
- [x] Handle `exists` inside `forall` properly, with a stack of substitution maps and shadowing (this is just a note to self) https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11462

Future:
The expressions can of course be simplified to transform things like `a * (- 1)` into `-a` among others, but that should go into a different PR.

I checked most of the tests and they are looking good.
Open question is how to report invariants in CLI interface. Do we have any open issue about additional way of reporting things from compiler? I think I saw discussion about having `notice` instead of warning, but can't find it now...

I am reviewing implementation now

We only briefly talked in the chat, should talk about that in the design call today.

Test `blockchain_state/balance_receive_calls.sol` has `(:var 1)` terms which should be taken care of.

This is now ready for review

@hrkrshnn I fixed the latest comments in new commits, will `fixup` those in the proper original commits when the PR is approved.

Fixed @cameel 's comments and fixedup the fixup commits into the original ones.

Agreed on a call with @hrkrshnn to report locations the same as warnings in a different PR.

Unfortunately I did not manage to finish the review today but so far I did not find anything that would look like an actual problem so if @hrkrshnn approves then I guess it should be fine to merge it.

@hrkrshnn merge merge?
