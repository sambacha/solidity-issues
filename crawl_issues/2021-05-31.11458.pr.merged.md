# [\#11458 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11458) `merged`: Add test with event where indexed parameters are not the first.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-05-31 12:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11458):

I noticed that we do not have a test where the indexed parameters for an event are not the first parameters.

I think the current behaviour is OK, just wanted to have this documented.

Given this, we could also use a separator between indexed parameters and non-indexed instead of prefixing all indexed arguments.
