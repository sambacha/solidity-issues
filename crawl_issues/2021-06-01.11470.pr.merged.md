Tests fail because the order of iteration is different. I think it would be good to preserve it - I'll think about it.

Regarding the order: Since C++11 the standard dictates ``The order of the key-value pairs whose keys compare equivalent is the order of insertion and does not change.``... with different keys the sorting is of course per name, though, but not sure that's too bad.

And I don't think there will be a way to have efficient lookup by name without sorting by name.
