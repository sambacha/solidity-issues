Partial fix for #11468

(some tests are still failing though. working on it).

I'll squash commits once :+1:'d

So your fix is to require an overriding modifier to be implemented, right? Is this the same requirement for functions? If yes, can we somehow to do it in a uniform manner?

@chriseth For functions the rule seems to be that you cannot override an implemented function with an unimplemented one unless:
- The function you're overriding is unimplemented too.
- You use multiple inheritance with a linearized order that effectively puts the unimplemented function before the implemented one (this is basically #11468).

If you manage to override it, you can call such an unimplemented function it in two cases:
- There is no code actually generated for the call. E.g. because you do it in a function that is itself overriden.
- (after #11472) You make a call via `super` and the unimplemented function gets skipped.

@christianparpart Looks like this breaks quite a few tests. I think that we need to allow at least cases where the modifier is used in its own (abstract) contract but only implemented in one that inherits from it (`empty_modifier_body.sol`). Those are probably not the only ones though.

Also, you should add some new tests, including the one from the issue. I'd also add some where you explicitly reference the unimplemented modifier via its contract name (we do not have a test for that).

Needs test updates.

I have changed the first comment because now this no longer completely fixes #11468.

I think @christianparpart wanted to create a new issue for the other part.
