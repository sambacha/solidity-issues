@chriseth About cases where we want different behavior between `super` lookup and ordinary virtual lookup:

1. `call_unimplemented_base_via_super.sol` (added in this PR) vs [`call_unimplemented_base.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/functionCalls/call_unimplemented_base.sol).
    - For non-`super` lookup `resolveVirtual()` returns an unimplemented function in this case. With `super` lookup it's a syntax error instead so `resolveVirtual()` is not called (which is what my comment points out).
2. `override_implemented_and_unimplemented_with_implemented_call_via_contract.sol` vs `override_implemented_and_unimplemented_with_implemented_call_via_super.sol` (both added in this PR).
    - Without `super` it's an error because we try to call a specific unimplemented function. From what I understood from your comment (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11445#issuecomment-852116242) `super` should instead skip the unimplemented one and proceed to the implemented one.
