The checks in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11475/files#diff-1286fd2f351e6a40b993189fde18c5db99ddfe4a35f4ada894945ba62819a324R1884 are all not related to types. Is it possible to move all of them to ContractLevelChecker?

@chriseth The link is broken for me. Do you just want to move `TypeChecker::typeCheckReceiveFunction` to ContractLevelChecker? 

It could be possible to move some of `typeCheckFallBackFunction` as well.

@hrkrshnn Yes, I have the impression that all checks in `TypeChecker::typeCheckReceiveFunction` can be moved because they are unrelated to types.
