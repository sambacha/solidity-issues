# [\#11476 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11476) `merged`: Fix ICE in IR when a library is bound to a literal

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-06-02 11:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11476):

Fixes #11325.

Removing the assertion checking supported types was enough to fix it.
- The list of types was incomplete - there is a way to bind a function to a literal.
- The assertion was meant to guard against silently skipping over types for which there is no handling implemented yet. The current code handles everything in a generic way though and likely will not have to be adjusted for newly added types so the risk of that happening is low.
