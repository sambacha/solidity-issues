### What did I change? 

- Enhancing all the .rst doc files by adding highlighting for the code snippets, including the following langs:
1. solidity
2. assembly
3. bash
4. javascript

Thanks so much!

@cameel can you check that the script that extracts code snippets from the documentation still works with these changes? I assume it does, but please double-check.

Sure. I'll check it when I get back to finish #11420.

> Thanks for the PR! Here's some feedback from me:

Thanks so much for your feedback. 
 
> * Some of these snippets are mislabeled. For example some `text` shippets are marked as `bash` and some `solidity` ones are really `yul`.

Regarding Yul and Solididyt conflicting, it was just because of my lack of experience with Yul. I will go over the changes again to make sure of that. 

> * Should we use `bash` or `shell` for shell snippets?

For my I based my selection to the most used one, so before my changes `.. code-block:: bash` was used more in all the docs: 

1. 4 times in [docs/smtchecker.rst](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/smtchecker.rst)
2. 2 times in [docs/layout-of-source-files.rst](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/layout-of-source-files.rst)
3. 23 times in [docs/installing-solidity.rst](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/installing-solidity.rst)

While `.. code-block:: shell` was used just 1 time in [docs/using-the-compiler.rst](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/using-the-compiler.rst)

Also, based on the following [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5725402/9058556) from StackOverflow on the `Difference between sh and bash`: 

> sh = bash?
For a long time, /bin/sh used to point to /bin/bash on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.

So I think we could follow with `.. code-block:: bash` since it's the most used one already. 

> * I'm not sure if we actually want to replace all the `::` bits with `code-block::`. I personally prefer the `code-block::` but `::` is already pretty prevalent so we should first discuss this change.

Based on the **rst** [documentation](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) in this section:

> To show example code, use the reStructured Text `code-block` directive: [Show Example Code](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_blocks.html#show-example-code)

So in order to highlight an example snippet of code, we need to use  `code-block`

> * Please squash your commits. Small commits are nice but simply putting every file in a separate commit does not really help reviewing. One way to split it that would actually be helpful would be if different highlighting languages were in different commits. But a single commit would be fine too since all of these modifications are closely related.

Yes, I agree with you, I'm working on squashing commits now.

Commits squashing is done.

`conf.py` mentions `highlight_language = 'Solidity'` - can we somehow rely on this default so that we do not have to specify the language for all the solidity code examples?

The intention is to have the code highlighted in GitHub, to be more readable.

@iskanderandrews Note that the docs are primarily meant to be viewed after being rendered by Sphinx (e.g. on https://docs.soliditylang.org), for which we do have Yul highlighting via a pygments plugin. Good highlighting on github is a good thing if possible but if there's a conflict between the too, I'd rather choose good highlighting in Sphinx over github.

But I think it's a good argument for not relying on the default language in `conf.py`. If github highlights it as solidity only if we specify the language explicitly then I think it's better to do so.

What do you mean by "highlighted in github"? Can you link to an example page on github?

> What do you mean by "highlighted in github"? Can you link to an example page on github?

Sure, so this is an example `docs/common-patterns.rst` from both repos: 

- Main ethereum/solidity: 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/common-patterns.rst

- Forked version iskanderandrews/solidity
https://github.com/iskanderandrews/solidity/blob/feature/docs-highlight-solc/docs/common-patterns.rst

So that's what I mean by "highlighted in github" thus making it more readable.

@chriseth 
> @cameel can you check that the script that extracts code snippets from the documentation still works with these changes? I assume it does, but please double-check.

It does. In #11565 I now have tests that show that it works both with `::` and `.. code-block:: solidity`. It does not really have any of them hard-coded. It finds all indented blocks in the docs and uses a heuristic to determine if they're Solidity code (i.e. checks for the SPDX comment, version pragma of a contract/library/interface declaration).

Alright, I think all has been resolved, I've rebased then squashed all commits. So, please review again, and mention me for any other changes or edits. 
Thank you so much!

It should run, not sure why it does not - or maybe it just does not report its status?
