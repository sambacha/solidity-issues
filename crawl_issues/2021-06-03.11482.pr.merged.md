# [\#11482 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11482) `merged`: Fix control-flow handling of modifiers without body.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-06-03 11:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11482):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10620

I'm still a bit puzzled why the bug does not manifest in
```solidity
abstract contract A {
    function f() public view mod {
        //uint x = 2;
        require(block.timestamp > 10);
    }
    modifier mod() virtual;
}
```
(the require statement is essential for the bug to trigger)

So maybe this is not the right fix.
