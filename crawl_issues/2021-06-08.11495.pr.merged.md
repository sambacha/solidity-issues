# [\#11495 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11495) `merged`: can not prefix with ``this.``

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/614159?v=4" width="50">[gqqnbig](https://github.com/gqqnbig) opened issue at [2021-06-08 08:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11495):

I'm a newbie, but I tried the following code

```
pragma solidity 0.8.4;

contract Add {

    uint x;

    constructor(uint a) public {
        this.x = a;
    }

}
```

Compiler gives error:

```
CompileError: TypeError: Member "x" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in contract Add.
  --> /B/add/contracts/add.sol:14:9:
   |
14 |         this.x = a;
   |         ^^^^^^
```

If I remove `this.`, the code compiles successfully.

I checked the documentation on https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html, which says "do not need the prefix this". This statement is confusing because it implies people are still able to prefix while the reality is prefixing fails the compiler.

As a result, I made the PR to make the statement clearer.

The matter is not as clear as it might look. You can actually use `this` but only for `public` variables (for `external` you _need_ this). For `internal` (the default if nothing specified, the case here) you can't use `this` again. 

`this` basically imitates an external access to the variable. 

A more correct way to fix the documentation could be this:

> To access an ``internal`` state variable, you do not need the prefix ``this.`` as is common in
other languages.

I think "do not need" is still clearer than "cannot use", because the latter does not state how you can access a state variable.

I think we should also clarify that this will result in an external call: "State variables and all other members of the current contract are accessed directly, without the `this.` prefix. For functions and public state variables, you can use `this.`, but you will obtain the externally-facing part of the item (external function or getter function) and calling it will result in a costly external call."

@chriseth I think that keeping it simple might be better after all. This is at the very beginning of "Introduction to Smart Contracts" which, I guess, is why @gqqnbig considers my version esoteric :) This is also why I scaled it back to something expressed in simpler terms.

Hi all, I adopted cameel's version, please check.

I accepted the suggestion. Not sure why the test failed.

Thank you everyone!
