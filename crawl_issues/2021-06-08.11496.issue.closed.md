Interesting! I think name simplifier simplifies the name `r._` to `r.`. And Yul doesn't allow names to end with dot.

This is the rule causing the issue: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/NameSimplifier.cpp#L100

Other rules that changes string to empty can also lead to this problem. For example, `r._fromStack` can also lead to this.

Maybe we should reconsider dot as an identifier name in Yul.

Would it be bad if the identifier ended in a dot?

Perhaps, if dot at the end is invalid, then dot anywhere should similarly be invalid. But, generally I'm indifferent about what to do about dots in Yul identifier.

Perhaps @axic has something to say? Context: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9306

Actually wait a second - shouldn't `NameDispenser::illegalName` just check that it does not start or end in a dot?

And `yul::isRestrictedIdentifier` should also check for the dot.

Actually it suffices to only change `isRestrictedIdentifier`

Smaller variant

```
{
  function e(_._) {
    e(0)
  }
  e(2)
}
```

Optimization is not required to trigger this ICE, simply 

```
solc --strict-assembly test.yul
```

where test.yul is the test case in the original post
