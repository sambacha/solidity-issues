# [\#11500 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11500) `merged`: Support metadata via IR.

Maybe fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10179

I think the current implementation does not yet guarantee the order of data - it might be based on the content hash.

This does not enforce source order on data sub-objects, but it makes ".metadata" a special data object that is always appended at the end.

Added changelog entry and documentation.

Ok, this is annoying. @axic how do we want to handle a sub-object called `".metadata"`? Should it be outright forbidden?

Why would subobject naming rules different from fields in a given object?

@axic how should
```
object "A" {
  code {}
  object ".metadata" { code { sstore(0, 1) } }
}
```
be handled? Would it compile? Would it be possible to access `datasize` of `A..metadata` inside the code of `A`?

Ok, it turns out that subobject access with items containing `.` never worked reliably, because `.` is used as a separator. I would propose to just disallow any access to anything that contains a `.`.

This should be ready for review now.
