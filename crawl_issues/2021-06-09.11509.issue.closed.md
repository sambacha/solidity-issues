As mentioned some time ago in #9175 it would be amazing to have a "Tour of Solidity" to run developers learning Solidity through the most important concepts and features in a quick click-through explanatory "course". 

The only two tours that I could find are:
- Erik's Tour of Solidity: https://github.com/erak/solidity-tour
- Certik's Tour of Solidity (using Sol 0.5.x): https://solidity-tour.certik.org/Basics/1

Both are quite outdated and incomplete. 

It would make sense to have such a tour since we know that the main resource people use to learn are actually our docs and learning games such as CryptoZombies.

This task could be outsourced or bountied possibly.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
