@chriseth did you mean to fix this issue like this? The current implementation seem to have a problem with structs and mappings. I didn't find the reason yet.

Yes, this is what I meant, but I'm still not sure if it does not create more problems.

How is this solving the core problem? Isn't this just reducing the probability? As long as the order of evaluation matches (even if AST ids are different), this will produce identical results.

How likely is it that the AST ids change, but the order of evaluation remains?

It at least condenses the IDs.

I think that the biggest problem with IDs was that they change when you compile a different set of input files. E.g. you'd get different IDs when compiling `a.sol b.sol` than when compiling only `b.sol` even if the contracts are completely independent. For that case the evaluation order should remain the same. Not sure this PR solves it completely (I think that e.g. immutable IDs are affected by this too) but I think it does at least for internal dispatch.

I'm now more confident that the IDs generated here are pretty stable. The function generation queue is based on AST IDs, the rest of the code generation is more or less in source order (depends on how sub-nodes are visited), and function IDs are generated when they are first requested, i.e. when a function is referenced.

This does create a disparity between the AST IDs that are part of the generated yul code (the function names) and the actual values used at runtime. Is that a problem? We have to use AST IDs for function names because we also generate yul functions for external solidity functions or functions that are not referenced and these AST IDs should be stripped in the final IR code anyway.

Previously, the code changes once you add another source file to the inputs, even if the source file is fully unrelated to the contract being complied.

Now, the code only changes if the current contract references a new internal function for use as a function pointer, so it should be fully independent from "cosmetic" source code changes or compiling all files at the same time / only compiling a single file.

Renamed the function.
