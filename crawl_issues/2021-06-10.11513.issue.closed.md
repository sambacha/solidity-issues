The constant optimizer should not only consider PUSH opcodes (stand-alone constants) but also PUSH opcodes in combination with other opcodes:

`C SUB` -> `(~C+1) ADD`


`C ADD` -> `~(C-1) SUB`

I think we can have a separate rule list for doing constant optimizations.

The transformation can look like

`ADD(A, X) -> SUB(X, 2**256 - A)` if `2**256 - A` is shorter than `A`.

Ah, I haven't thought of that: It is difficult to do it at the opcode level (at least for the add -> sub part), because the transformation would be
```
... A ADD
->
... ~(A-1) SWAP1 SUB
```

This means the transformation is not really much cheaper than what we already have, which is replacing `A` by `~A NOT`.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
