# [\#11518 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11518) `merged`: CommandLineParser

Related to #11386. Partial solution for #5303.
~Depends on  #11571.~ Merged.

The PR extracts the logic responsible for interpreting and validating command-line options from `CommandLineInterface` into a new class: `CommandLineParser`. The new class has clearly separated input and output and therefore can be easily tested.

Putting #11386 on top of this PR will let me actually have the whole path-related behavior covered by some sensible tests rather than just the part that has been extracted into `FileReader`. Hopefully it will also be a good first step for the full CLI refactor in the future.

To make this easier to review I tried to keep changes to the absolute minimum. I found some things that could be cleaned up or fixed but I'll be submitting these in separate PRs to keep the diff here understandable. I recommend reviewing individual commits and skipping the first one, which  only copies `CommandLineParser.cpp`/`.h` without any modifications. This way you'll see in the second one that actual changes are pretty small and most of the churn is the removal of fragments that belong in the other class and switching to getting values from the new options struct.

I just pushed an updated version. It only changes the handling of the `coloredOutput` option to make it independent of the TTY. Checking the TTY is now done after option parsing, in `CommandLineInterface`. This should fix the test failures on Windows.

Once I see that it works, I'll remove the debug commits with stream operators and mark the PR as reviewable.

Still failing. This time because I missed one use of `isatty()` (for help text). This is a bit annoying because these things only fail on 
Windows (probably becase on Linux `isatty()` already gets included through other headers and on Windows we need to define it).

I just pushed a fix. I changed `CommandLineParser::parse()` to take an argument saying whether we have an interactive terminal.

All tests passed so I'm done here. Marking as reviewable.

Fixed about half of the small suggestions. The other half is fine but I'd like to leave them out of this PR. This one was meant to be mostly a split and not a complete cleanup of `CommandLineInterface`. There are too many small things to fix and I wanted to keep the PR manageable.

There are two changes I have not done yet: the `CMakeLists.txt` suggestion (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11518#discussion_r655289614) and checking compilation result (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11518#discussion_r655278172).

This is ready for another round. I have squashed previous fixups and created new ones with changes added after @Marenz's review. The PR is also now based on #11571 which implements one of @christianparpart's suggestions.

I just pushed to the branch but it's just a rebase on `develop` so don't worry about it if you're currently reviewing :)

I applied some of @christianparpart's suggestions and responded to the remaining ones. Old fixups squashed and all new changes are in new fixups. Ready for another round of review.

@cameel well, a squash would make sense, I guess :)

Just pushed the fix for the `test` -> `text` typo and squashed a fixup. No other changes.
