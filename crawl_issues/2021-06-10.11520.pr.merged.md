~Depends on #11518. In draft mode until that PR gets merged.~ Merged.

Now that we have tests for the part of `CommandLineInterface` that I extracted into `CommandLineParser` in #11518, we're getting messages printed during tests because they get written directly to `cerr`/`cout`. This PR changes `CommandLineParser` so that it receives streams as constructor parameters. In tests `stringstreams` are now used which also lets us compare the content of these streams in tests and see it test output if such a check fails.

#11518 has been merged so this PR is now reviewable.
