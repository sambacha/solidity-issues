# [\#11525 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11525) `merged`: Yul control flow graph (OptimizedEVMCodeTransform Step 1)

First step involved in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493.

If anyone has a better idea for unit-testing this, I'm open to suggestions :-).

Still missing tests for stuff like ``continue``, ``break``, ``leave``, reverting control flow and probably more stuff.

~~Hm - and I moved this from ``libyul/backends/evm`` to ``libyul`` thinking that it's generic, but it actually isn't - the whole business of function return labels makes it rather evm specific, so maybe it should be moved back.~~

~~Actually, this should also mention the entries of each block in the test expectations, so that's also still missing.~~

I'm marking this "ready for review", even though it still needs more tests as mentioned in the description.
It's the first two commits of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493/.

There is the option, though, to change the way this works by having it rely on the disambiguator, for-loop-condition-into-body and expression splitter. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/newCodeGeneratorWithExpressionSplitter (in particular https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/f1a04d3098ac5cf1fd4c2ce98664c5cfdd989173) is a sketch of what that would look like. But I'm not sure if it's the right way to go. In its current state it generates less-optimal code than https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493. Maybe that could be fixed, but that would probably involve to first take care of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493#discussion_r651808556 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493#discussion_r651807831.

Generally, I think not going down that road and keeping it at the version in this PR, resp. in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493, might be better after all.

Addressed all comments again.
Also in case this comes up ;-): if we want to just have more test cases, I suggest to collect cases we want and add them later on, but not keep this PR pending because of it. The graph won't be used for anything until the follow-up PRs are merged, so we can extend test coverage in parallel.

Haha, it will definitely come up :) I'm fine with adding a more complete coverage only in later PRs though. I saw you have already put a lot of effort into testing it.

On the other hand we really have to take care that we test the hell out of it before we actually enable the new code transform for anything. The new code transform will basically be able to - at least to some degree - self-assert its correctness, but only relative to this graph, so the graph has to be rock-solid. But yeah, to feasibly make progress on it, it's probably wise to spread it out a bit.

[For the record basically what I just said on the matrix channel] Well, they *don't* have unique names, the preexisting (and thus here not explicitly tested) scoping mechanism just maps them to unique pointers, but those I can't really display in the tests, so I settle for the names instead, even though they are ambiguous, so it's not unexpected that this won't show up nicely in the tests. If this is bothersome, I can just disambiguate the AST after all, that's easier than trying to artifically choose determinstic unique names for the scope pointers just for testing (which would basically mean duplicating the disambiguation logic for testing this).

@hrkrshnn I changed my mind and just pushed a small change to the tests, at least adding the body block ID of a function to the graph node name, which makes them work nicely with graphviz, that still won't actually show different names, but use the same labels for several distinct ``Scope::*`` pointer thingys for identifiers with the same name, but at least the graph will still show nicely.
I think that's a good compromise.
Also: it may very well be that later on in subsequent steps we'll start storing assigned values for SSA variables in their ``VariableSlot`` to make it easier for the code generator to eliminate them directly, if required - once we'd start doing that at the latest, I'd actually require the input for this thing to be disambiguated (although to be safe I might actually still use the ``Scope`` mechanism in parallel to be able to assert that input **is** properly disambiguated in that case).
