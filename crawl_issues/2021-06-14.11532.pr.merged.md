# [\#11532 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11532) `merged`: Workaround for archlinux z3 4.8.11 + remove runc workaround

Z3 4.8.11 has hit main Arch Linux repos. Since it's just a prerelease (see https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/5330) and it makes one of the SMT tests cases hang and time out in CI (`smtCheckerTests/file_level/recursion.sol`), we're just going to disable SMT tests on Arch for now and wait for a proper release.

~The PR also removes an older Arch Linux workaround: #11332. (Need to see if it actually works now; draft until then)~ Looks like it's still an issue.

Looks like the workaround for #11332 is still needed:
```
error: failed to initialize alpm library:
(root: /, dbpath: /var/lib/pacman/)
could not find or read directory
```
Removing.
