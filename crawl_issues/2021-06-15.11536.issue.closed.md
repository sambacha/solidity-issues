# [\#11536 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11536) `closed`: Expression evaluation order for binary operators in Sol->Yul codegen.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-06-15 10:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11536):

While the order of evaluation for expression is undefined and for that reason this is "fine" in principle, I'm wondering:

In legacy codegen, for binary expressions, we evaluate right-hand-side first, then left-hand-side (unless one is a literal).
In Yul codegen we do the opposite and evaluate left-hand-side first, then right-hand-side.

Is there any good reason for doing it like that in Yul codegen?

If there is not there are two reasons for switching to the same behaviour as legacy code generation:
- If there is no good reason for using diverging behaviour, the divergence is basically intentionally screwing people without reason (even though it'd only happen for "bad" code relying on undefined behaviour, but still).
- Evaluating the right-hand-side first allows for more-optimal stack layouts (since the right-hand-side will end up as right-most argument to a builtin call and has to be deeper in stack than the left-hand-side - while some of the operations are commutative, not all of them are, and even for commutative ones, it's additional stress for the code generation to exploit that).

Unless there is a reason for keeping the current behaviour, I vote for changing the order to match legacy code generation.

Actually, there's yet another reason: it's annoying for fuzzing ;-).

For the record: the old evm code transform does not seem to benefit from the changed order, but the new evm code transform I'm writing in fact tends to benefit from the changed order.

As @hrkrshnn pointed out, we could consider keeping the left-first-then-right order for shift operations - for those it might actually result in better code. Although we'd have to weigh that benefit against the divergence compared to legacy codegen.

[EIP-145](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-145) mentions:

> Instruction operands were chosen to fit the more natural use case of shifting a value already on the stack. This means the operand order is swapped compared to most arithmetic insturctions.

It would be unfortunate if changing the order (to right to left) would lead to less optimal code for shifts. Also, not so keen on introducing exceptions for rules.

Well, if anything, then we should have suboptimal code for shifts, not all other operations, especially since that's the same behaviour as legacy code generation.
Shifts with non-literal shift amounts I'd expect to be rare compared to other operations.

Actually yes. So probably shifts are not a problem.

Also: the way things currently work, shifts also don't benefit from the evaluation order I think, since we have those helper functions taking the reverse order for arguments and I guess inlining will preserve the argument evaluation order. Haven't checked, though.

Hm... I was operating under the assumption that - like in Yul - function arguments were evaluated right-to-left but in fact they aren't, neither for legacy nor for Yul code generation... so that... changes things :-).

So since it seems unlikely that we'd actually want to change the order at this point, we should probably investigate how best to get around the gas cost that's inflicted by doing things left-to-right. However, as @hrkrshnn pointed out, for that it might first be helpful to check if there actually *are* gas costs remaining due to this, if we run the libevmasm optimizer after IR codegen. Respectively, it might be worth keeping this in mind for the new evm code transform.

Closing since we want to stick to strict left-to-right evaluation order.
