Actually, even the current evm code transform seems to profit from this gas-wise.

Granted, though, the real-world external contract tests seem hardly affected.

Since after the discussion of this and realizing that function argument evaluation order is left-to-right actually, we'll probably not merge this, just as a note:
In order to avoid false positives during fuzzing we could use a patched version of old code generation for fuzzing, which has https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e7bf1cc7e7eb99c6143da6a6aaa6b890b99fc3e8/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L536 swapped with the next line.

(Note that the case where ``swap`` is true a few lines further up should only be cases, in which the order will not affect the outcome, so it's only the ``swap == false`` case that would need a patch)

@ekpyron should we still review this PR? Or has it been decided that won't be done?

@leonardoalt The comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11536#issuecomment-861634369 suggests that it's unlikely to get this merged. I'll keep this PR as draft for now.

I think @bshastry wanted to use this somehow in the fuzzer.

JFYI: I've made a note of this change and am already using it for fuzzing!

I think it's fine to close this.
