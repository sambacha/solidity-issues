# [\#11544 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11544) `merged`: Common input file processing for CLI and Standard JSON

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-06-16 20:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11544):

Fixes #11552.
~Depends on #11520. Draft until that one is merged.~ Merged.

The main purpose of this refactor is to group input file processing and `FileReader` initialization in `CommandLineInterface` into an independent phase (`readInputFiles()`), separate from actually running the compiler. This way its results can be easily tested. So far almost all of this was already grouped into `readInputFilesAndConfigureFileReader()` except for stuff related to Standard JSON. This PR unifies the logic for Standard JSON with that for other modes.

As a side effect this improves the behavior with `--standard-input`:
- Fixes the crash from #11552.
-  An explicit request to read from standard input (the `-` option) now works in that mode too.
-  Technically, `--ignore-missing` now works as well but it's useless because in Standard JSON you cannot specify more than one file.
- If you try to specify remappings on the command line you get an error explicitly telling you to put them in JSON instead of one saying that there are too many input fiies.

This is now ready for another round.

Looks good to me, at least for now I only found one small thing. 

However, I was wondering whether we should reduce the line numbers used in `bool CommandLineParser::parse(...)`. I think this function is a bit too long (ca. 700 lines).

I totally agree. This is not a new thing though. The functions in `CommandLineInterface` were already pretty big and I just did not split them to keep the diff smaller. I'm going to do some more refactors, but step by step, over time because this is not a priority right now. The main point of my refactor was only to make the CLI somewhat testable, not to rewrite it all :)

Fixes applied, comments answered. This is ready for another round.

@Marenz Can you reapprove? I only squashed fixups.

I'm adding some refactors from work on #11688. All of this basically only touches the test utilities and should not require re-reviewing the whole PR. Since this PR has not been merged yet, I think it makes more sense to change this stuff here instead of having to immediately refactor it in later PRs. Everything that has been added is in fixup commits:
- Added `test/solc/Common.h` and moved helpers from `CommandLineInterface`/`CommandLineParser` tests there.
    - Made `parseCommandLineAndReadInputFiles()` a bit more generic.
- Operators for printing sources, allowed paths and remappings if a test fails.
- `createEmptyFilesWithParentDirs()` is now `createFilesWithParentDirs()` and you can specify file content.
- `TEST_CASE_NAME` (see #11686).

Great. In that case I've squashed the fixups and rebased on develop so that it's ready to merge.

Conflict resolved. It was just a change from #11639 that added the formatting parameter to `StandardCompiler`. I just adjusted the constructor invocation in `CommandLineInterface.cpp`.
