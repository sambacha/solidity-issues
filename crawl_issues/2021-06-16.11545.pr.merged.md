# [\#11545 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11545) `merged`: Stripping base path from CLI paths

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-06-16 20:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11545):

Fixes #4702.
Implements the `solc` part of #11408. `solc-js` changes will be submitted in that repo.
~Depends on #11544.~ Merged.

This still work in progress. I'd say It's about 90% done. There's not much implementation left (it's very small overall) but some corner cases are not yet handled or not handled properly:
- [x] Paths with a different case on case-insensitive filesystems.
- [x] Paths starting with `//` (UNC paths).
- [x] Paths using `..` to go beyond filesystem root (boost's normalization does not squash `/../` into `/`).
- [x] Paths with symlinks.
- [x] Removing root name so that paths always start with `/` (rather than drive letter on Windows) when they're on the same partition as CWD.
- [x] Different behavior on some older Boost versions.

Here's a short update on the current status on this PR:
- I dealt with most of the corner cases listed in PR description. The last remaining ones are:
    - Symlinks. On macOS in CI the path to the temporary directory contains a symlink (`/var/folders/` -> `/private/var/folders/`) and Boost sometimes resolves the symlink when the path is relative and starts with `../`. I suspect it might be a bug in its boost version but I need to investigate. This will be tedious because I can reproduce it only in CI.
    - The root path is sometimes `C:/` on Windows where it should be normalized to `/`. This might be a bug on my part.
- Base path docs need to be updated.
- I resolved all the CI failures in the refactor PRs it depends on (#11518, #11520, #11544). But as requested by @chriseth I'll put this one directly on `develop` anyway - in a stripped-down version (without CLI tests) - once I get tests to pass.

This PR is now working correctly on all platforms. It still depends on the CLI refactor so I have created an equivalent PR without the CLI tests that does not: #11617. These tests turned out to be crucial as I suspected though. There were tons of weird cases and the `FileReader` unit tests did not catch many of them (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11617#issuecomment-874309838).

#11544 has been merged so this is now reviewable.

Note that the only difference between this PR and #11617 are tests in `test/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp` so if you reviewed that other one already, you only have to take a look at that one extra file.

Old fixups squashed. New changes added in new fixups. Ready for another round.

Please review https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/533 too, which is the equivalent PR for solc-js. It's much shorter because the normalization there is not as strict.

While working on #11409 I found a small bug introduced in this PR: standard input was not being handled correctly in combination with base path. `<stdin>` was converted to an absolute path as if it were a file name. I added a fixup that solves this and contains a test for this case.

I have also squashed the older fixups.

I just pushed an updated version. It removes `defaultCommandLineOptions()` and has slightly reworded documentation (backported here from my new PR for `--include-path`).

Thanks @leonardoalt! Could you reapprove? I just squashed the fixups.
