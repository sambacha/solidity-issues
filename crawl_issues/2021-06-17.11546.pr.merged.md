I added Big Sur 11.3 and 11.4 to to the scripts/install_deps.sh file. This should not have impacted any existing functionality; however, I did run the test suite. The only failure was the failure mentioned by @cameel in #11426.

Thanks for the PR! I'll rebase this now to fix the CI.

Hello, could you please do the same thing for Big Sur 11.5? thank you!

Maybe we should consider changing the condition to just `11.*)`. The code will probably work for any point release and it might a be better experience for users if they do not have to tweak it manually or ping us on every minor macOS release. If it breaks, they can always submit a bug report.

@lagagne72 Would you like to submit a PR?
