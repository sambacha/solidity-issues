https://solidity-by-example.org has a lot of example contracts we may want to include in the main documentation or in #11509

To solve this issue do we add a hyperlink to the above website in the resources section of our documentation or create a different page by name of solidity tutorials

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
