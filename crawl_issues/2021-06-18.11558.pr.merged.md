# [\#11558 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11558) `merged`: Yul: custom source locations (`@src`)

(the branch name is misleading)

This implements the parser part of #11086.

I've added some tests to make sure nesting does produce the expected source locations, I am however not too sure if I should test now every type of AST node for Yul. Should I?

### checklist

- [x] eliminate `_fromDoc` (make it part of `Parser` instead
- [x] refert the `{}`'s in AST.h
- [x] if an `@src` was found, use that not just for the next AST node.
- [x] write tests for newly added parser errors

Please check (using a test) that the source location change is correctly applied in the following example:
```
{
  {
  /// @src a:b;c
  }
  let x := 1
}
```

If it is not, let us talk about it, it might be difficult.

I think the above can be realized in the following way:

1) the parser has to be created in one of two modes: a) taking source locations from the scanner b) taking source locations from comments - in the second case, the index -> source mapping is passed to the constructor. The `@use-src` tag switches the parser into this mode, but it has to be the very first thing in the source. Because of this, it could be outside the code (in the object). This, the object parser has to deal with it.

2) if in "take from comments" mode, the `advance()` function has to be overridden (and we have to make sure it is always used), such that it checks if after the advancement, there is a "current comment literal" containing a `@src` annotation. In this case, it is stored as the current source location (we could re-use "m_locationOverride" but would probable rename it). We have to make sure that this also works at the beginning of parsing, before the first call to `advance()`.

No further change to the parser is required.

Actually there is one tiny change: `updateLocationEndFrom` has to be omitted if we have a location from comments. This should have been the case for `m_locationOverride` already and is kind of a bug, but it is irrelevant if the "override location" is always the same.

Can you extract the changes to ParserBase and the Solidity Parser to its own pull request?

Please add some tests where there source location changes in between statements like
```
{
  let x := /// @src ...
  add(1, /// @src ...
2)
}
```
and
```
{
  {
    sstore(0, 1)
    /// @src ...
  }
  mstore(1, 2)
}
```
(in the second example, only the source location of the mstore should be changed, not the block itself.

@chriseth there are two other note-worthy / important changes.

1. the source location of an `if` statement now covers all until the end of the body (initially only the `if` token), and
2. the source location of a block now also covers the full block.

these two changes are the reason for the test case changes that are not in `test/yul/Parser.cpp`.
