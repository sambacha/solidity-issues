Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8973

This PR adds
- support to contract deployment
- user can consider external calls trusted if code is available
The CHC.cpp code doing both these items is rather small, but it depends on a larger Horn encoding change:
Every predicate has the `state` tuple as a parameter, which currently only has one element, an array `balances` that maps `address => uint`.
The encoding change we make here is to add to `state`:
- an array `isActive` that maps `address => bool` representing whether an address is already used by a deployed contract. This is used for contract deployment to make sure different contracts have different addresses.
- a tuple `storage` that represents the storage of every analyzed contract. Since the SMT types are strong and different contracts have different state variables, each element of this tuple `storage` is an array that maps `address => specific_contract_storage_tuple`. The latter then is a tuple that contains the state variables of a contract.

An example of the last part.
Take the contracts
```
contract C { uint x; uint y; }
contract D { address a; address b; }
```
and let's say we have two C's of addresses 1 and 2, and one D of address 3.
The global storage above would be
```
state {
    balances: ...,
    isActive: {1: true, 2: true, 3: true},
    storage: {
        1: contract_C_storage_tuple { 5, 6 }, // values are arbitrary here
        2: contract_C_storage_tuple { 7, 8 },
        3: contract_D_storage_tuple { 0x01, 0x02 }
    }
}
```

The basic idea of the PR is to use this `storage` as a synchronization buffer when external calls are made.
Example:
```
contract Ext {
    uint e;
    function f() public { ... }
}

contract Test {
    uint x;
    function g(Ext e) public {
        ...
        e.f();
    }
}
```

While analyzing `Test.g`, we use the state variables that are already in the predicate as usual. That is a lot more efficient for the solver since we avoid unnecessary datatypes.
Before the call `e.f()`, we
- write the current state variables of `Test` to `state.storage`,
- read the current state variables of `Ext` from `state.storage` into `summary_f(state_vars, state_vars')` and add that as a constraint, which in practice means `Ext.f` "runs".

When we're back  at `Test`, after `e.f`, we
- read the state variables of `Test` from `state.storage` into the current predicate variables
- write the state variables of `Ext` from `state_vars'` above into `state.storage`.

Of course if the called function is view/pure/staticcall we don't need the post step above.

@ekpyron some of the tests might be failing due to nondeterminism on the invariants (I'm on it) but can already be reviewed.

> Just random comment: this won't catch (this).f() and the like... then again, syntactically, you can't catch C c = this; c.f() anyways, so...

These won't trigger the "external call to this", but should actually work in the trusted mode. Will add those tests too.

I'm wondering about how ``address`` casts work with all this:
Does stuff like this work at all?
```
contract D {
        constructor(uint _x) { x = _x; }
	uint public x;
}

contract C {
	function f() public {
                address d = address(new D(42));
		assert(D(d).x() == 42); // should hold
	}
}
```
If this works, then I wonder about state variables of address types and non-deterministic calls. If it doesn't work, then I guess it doesn't matter too much...

lol at first I actually didn't expect this to work but it does.
So I do need to add `address` to the commit that havocs things

So what happens for
```
contract D {
	uint public x;
	function setD(uint _x) public { x = _x; }
}

contract C {
	address d;
	constructor() {
		d = address(new D());
		assert(D(d).x() == 0); // should hold
	}
	function f() public view {
		assert(D(d).x() == 0); // should fail
	}
}
```
now?
Not entirely sure, but I think this may require another havok case in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11559/files#r827774621... even though that's rather unfortunate, since it may break stuff just because you have an ``address owner;`` or sth...

@ekpyron I added `address` to the nested types (together with contracts) that should case a contract's storage to be havoc'ed. The new commit is:

By the way, though: what would you think about expression level annotations for only assuming trusted code for explicit variables selectively? That would make it much easier to see what could go wrong and would also keep things computationally less expensive, wouldn't it?

It's hard to tell what exactly makes things computationally more expensive. Yes the encoding gets more complicated, and counterexamples sometimes more difficult to generate, but we do get rid of `nondet_interface` constraints which rely a lot more on inductive invariants which are one of the hardest parts of solving.

That said, your idea could also be good. Though it wouldn't solve the unsoundness problems.

Yeah, won't solve them, but may make it more visible where assumptions are injected and which exactly... i.e. just a
```
contract D {}
contract C {
 /// @smt assume-type D
  address x;
}
```
makes it perfectly clear what exactly you assume there.

But yeah, just a random idea - not suggesting to change this PR towards any of that.

Yea we could use the custom natspec stuff we already have to extend this feature to something like that later on.
