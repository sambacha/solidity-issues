# [\#11567 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11567) `merged`: Fix ICE when calling functions bound to calldata structs and arrays

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-06-22 12:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11567):

Fixes #10186.
Depends on #11568.

I'm still not sure if the cleanup is warranted in that case but @chriseth said that it's supposed to work even with such cleanup so this PR enables it. Removing assertions removes the ICE and no tests seem to be failing.

Actually let me create a new PR just for the changelog and the version change.

Just realized this does not fix the array case (only the struct). Marking as draft to prevent merging but I'll push a fix in a moment.

Arrays fixed. Ready for review again.

Rebased on top of the changelog update for 0.8.7 (#11568).
