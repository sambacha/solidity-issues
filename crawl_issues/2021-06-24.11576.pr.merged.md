Reported in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11543#issuecomment-862554471:

> Ooooook, i'll try it, it's because in the documentation there is a mention that standard-json does not need to mount volumes.
> Maybe should change it no ? cause it's way easier with mounted volume, at least we are quiet tranquil for the remaining problem.
