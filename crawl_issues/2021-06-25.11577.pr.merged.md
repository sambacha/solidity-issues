Shouldn't this be breaking?

We discussed it on the chat and @chriseth's opinion was that it should not.

Strictly it is breaking. @axic what do you think?

It is a though question.  Since we never intended this to happen and rather started out with a very restricted feature set for interfaces (recall #3420 and many other related issues), it is easy to see that this is an oversight and a bug.

However given this likely existed for 2 years and that some forms worked, makes me wonder if anyone relies on it?

And if they do, what does that mean? Likely only that they are locked in to the last version if they insist on this feature.  If we want to be careful, we could ask others from the ecosystem (like the tooling channel).  If we are more confident that this is something nobody ever should have used, then we should go ahead in a non-breaking release and create a blog post to spread the word.

I'm leaning towards not making this a breaking change.

I'm also fine with calling it a bugfix.

The documentation does not mention modifiers, but it says that functions cannot be implemented, so I hope nobody thought that modifiers can be implemented... https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/contracts.html#interfaces

Can you also update the documentation? It also seems that the bullet list somehow does not render properly.

I mentioned this on matrix two weeks ago, none of the bullet points render anywhere.

Rebased to resolve the changelog conflict and update docs.

I updated the page to mention modifiers.

The bullet list issue seems to be a general issue with the docs now so I'm going to work on it in a separate PR. No need to hold back this one because of it.

Now it's inconsistent with e.g. constructors, because there you only write "declare".

Changed to just "declare".
