# [\#11579 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11579) `merged`: Better errors about bad paths in tests with external sources

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-06-25 12:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11579):

Related to #11528. Not sure I can say it actually fixes it since that code will still fail, just with a more sensible error message now.

Note that this covers not only UNC paths (ones starting with `\\` or `//`) but also directories in general. Until now using a directory as an external source target was causing `std::length_error` too.

Does `echo contract C {} | solc /dev/stdin` still work?

Still? It does not but it does not work on `develop` either. In both cases you'll get this:
```
"/dev/stdin" is not a valid file.
```
That's because we already check `is_regular_file()` in `CommandLineInterface.cpp` and my PR just adds it in `readFile()` too.

Do we want to support this case?

BTW, this shows that we really need more tests covering the CLI. I was not even aware that there was a device representing `stdin` (seems logical in retrospect though).

> Would the test from #11528 throw once this PR is merged?

Yes. This was the original motivation behind this PR. It would hit this condition in `TestCaseReader.cpp`:
```c++
if (!externalSourceTarget.is_relative() || !externalSourceTarget.root_path().empty())
	// NOTE: UNC paths (ones starting with // or \\) are considered relative by Boost
	// since they have an empty root directory (but non-empty root name).
	BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION(runtime_error("External Source paths need to be relative to the location of the test case."));
```

It's still an exception but at least now with a somewhat relevant message.

I'm fine with the direction of the PR, but did not do a full review.
