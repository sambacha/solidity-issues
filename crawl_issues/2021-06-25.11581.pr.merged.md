# [\#11581 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11581) `merged`: Fix `bytes.concat("")`

Discovered while working on #11539/#11580. The cause and fix are very similar, this is just a different case that was not in the original report.

Looks good in general, only one small suggestion

Does this allocate a size-0 memory array or does it a) not allocate at all or b) use the special "fixed" zero-length memory array?

If it is a) or b) I'm fine with merging as is.

As far as I understood it skips `""` argument, so it should be option a) not allocating at all

Please verify by looking at the generated code, @cameel

OK, I'll check but right away I can say that, at least in the code that collects types of arguments, `""` goes into the same branch as `bytes` (rather than fixed bytes).

I checked the IR output and looks like it does not allocate memory at all for string literals. It only allocates memory for the resulting bytes variable. The string literals are just embedded directly in Yul code.

I tried these 4 cases:
- `bytes memory b = bytes.concat("", "", "");`
- `bytes memory b = abi.encodePacked("", "", "");`
- `bytes memory b = bytes.concat("abc", "abc", "abc");`
- `bytes memory b = abi.encodePacked("abc", "abc", "abc");`

In cases with empty strings you get a function called `store_literal_in_memory_<string hash>(memPtr)` with empty body. For `"abc"` you get a function that does `mstore(pos, "abc")`.

In all four cases there's just a single pair of `allocate_unbounded()` + `finalize_allocation()` calls and that's for the result.

Oh, and between `bytes.concat()` and `abi.encodePacked()` variants the code is nearly identical. It differs only by insignificant details like inlining and naming (`abi.encodePacked` interprets the literal as `string`, and `bytes.concat()` as `bytes`).
