# [\#11583 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11583) `closed`: Make `--pretty-json` work with Standard JSON output
**Labels**: `good first issue`, `easy difficulty`

By default the compiler prints any JSON output in a compact form:

```bash
echo "contract C {}" | solc - --combined-json abi
```
```json
{"contracts":{"<stdin>:C":{"abi":[]}},"version":"0.8.6+commit.11564f7e.Linux.g++"}
```

You can use `--pretty-json` option to get nicely indented output from `--combined-json` option:

```bash
echo "contract C {}" | solc - --combined-json abi --pretty-json
```
```json
{
  "contracts":
  {
    "<stdin>:C":
    {
      "abi": []
    }
  },
  "version": "0.8.6+commit.11564f7e.Linux.g++"
}
```

This does not work with `--standard-json`. Make `--pretty-json` affect it too.

Optionally, it would also be nice if you could specify the indent size for the option to make the output easier to read (e.g. `--pretty-json 4`).

Once this is done, we could also make `test/cmdlineTest.sh` use that option to print test output in a more readable way.
