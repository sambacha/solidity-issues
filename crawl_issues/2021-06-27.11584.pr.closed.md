@TerranCivilian To say that a PR fixes an issue you can put `Fixes #11553` in the first comment. Then github will automatically close it when the PR is merged. I edited your title description to move it there.

Thanks for that, and thanks for the tip. I'm hoping to resolve this by the end of the week. Just depends on how lazy I feel after work.

Oh god, sorry @cameel , I tried to do the rebase thing but it was quickly apparent I had no clue what I was doing.. and then this^ happened. I am not sure what I did to be honest

edit: I think I might've done the rebase correctly actually; but as my remote repo became out of date after my local repo fetched your upstream commits, a conflict between local and remote repos arose and I was unable to resolve it

Oh, looks like me merging #11589 made github close this PR on my behalf. Weird, must be because it's an external PR. Normally it just changes the PR base branch to `develop`.

I also can't reopen this for some reason. @TerranCivilian If the "reopen" option is not greyed out for you, pleaase reopen the PR. If it is, well, you can just open a new PR once you're done. Sorry for this mess :)

Oh, no problem, my first PR was awful anyway xD
