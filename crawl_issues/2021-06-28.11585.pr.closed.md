# [\#11585 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11585) `closed`: fix bug of the method bid of SimpleAuction

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3859958?u=423494b1305cbad025242c3e231d5f9fdcb38c26&v=4" width="50">[wangjohnny](https://github.com/wangjohnny) opened issue at [2021-06-28 06:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11585):

test code:
```js
let auction = await SimpleAuction.deployed()

auction.bid({from: accounts[1], value: web3.utils.toWei('1', 'ether')})
auction.bid({from: accounts[2], value: web3.utils.toWei('2', 'ether')})
auction.bid({from: accounts[3], value: web3.utils.toWei('3', 'ether')})// The data of accounts[3] will not pushed into the Array pendingReturns

auction.withdraw({from: accounts[1]})
auction.withdraw({from: accounts[2]})
auction.withdraw({from: accounts[3]}) // This will not work, because the Array pendingReturns dose not include the data of accounts[3]

```

The correct code is as follows:

```solidity
highestBidder = msg.sender;
highestBid = msg.value;
if (highestBid != 0) {
  pendingReturns[highestBidder] += highestBid;
}
```

Well, I don't think the person with the highest bid is supposed to withdraw his money. Therefore, the current implementation is okay.

Your implementation allows everyone to withdraw their bids.

I'm closing this for now, let us know if there is something we can add to the section on the docs to make this difference clearer.
