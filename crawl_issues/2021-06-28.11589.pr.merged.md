# [\#11589 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11589) `merged`: Make CommonIO testable

Especially standard input reading so that we can add a test in #11584.

Note: This PR contains bits from #11579 and #11520 to avoid creating more dependencies between PRs. As it is now they can all be reviewed and merged independently and whichever of these PRs goes in first, the duplicated bits will disappear from the others during the rebase.
