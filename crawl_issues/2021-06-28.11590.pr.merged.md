Fixes #11588.
~Depends on #11591 (fix for tests on `develop`).~ Merged.

- ~Disallows `0` but still allows `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.~ Disallows all numeric zero literals.
- Fixes ICE when using `bytes.concat()` with 32-byte hex literals.
    - By disallowing them.

I think we should implement this with a bit more foresight and change the condition to the following:

If the type is a reference type and convertible to bytes memory, it is accepted.
If the type is a bytesNN, it is accepted.
Otherwise:
 - check for all possible bytesNN types and for bytes memory if conversion is possible.
 - reject if conversion is possible for more than one bytesNN type
 - accept if conversion is possible for at least one of the types (bytesNN / bytes memory)

Sounds good. Just one detail:

> check for all possible bytesNN types and for bytes memory if conversion is possible.

Should I just iterate over `bytes1`..`bytes32` or is there a smarter way to do it?

I don't know a better way than iterating.

Solution changed to disallowing all numeric literals in `bytes.concat()`. Ready for another review.
