Hello, 

I am trying to retrieve the IPFS hash/file that is at the bottom of the Contract tab

https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbd3c0c794f40c4f993b03f65343acc6fcfcb2e2#code

This is the link:
ipfs://62c1e84b5f1f3effe1c0e4adbbd785ad950c738ea87a7aaef091add4452a9cbd

from my understanding and from the solidity docs this is the IPFS hash of the file but IPFS responds with:
Error: invalid path "/ipfs/62c1e84b5f1f3effe1c0e4adbbd785ad950c738ea87a7aaef091add4452a9cbd": invalid CID: selected encoding not supported

What encoding is missing? what needs to be converted?
Please help?

it looks like i need to base58 encode this:
122062c1e84b5f1f3effe1c0e4adbbd785ad950c738ea87a7aaef091add4452a9cbd

which gives me this:
QmUzAA35NGHkSs5nMDXh9HgvbNWwmiQ24xQTx3Ppedfeip

which LOOKS like a valid hash for ipfs.
but it hangs and never receives anything.
if someone could point me in the right direction?

This seems to be an issue with etherscan, they do not format the binary data. In general, IPFS is not guaranteed to keep the data available, there is not even a guarantee that the data has been uploaded at all.
