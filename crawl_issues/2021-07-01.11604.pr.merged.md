# [\#11604 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11604) `merged`: Make Yul tests independent of optimizer

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-01 14:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11604):

Extracted from #10286.
Related to #11319.

This is a bunch refactors in Yul tests to make them still properly test the things they are meant to test regardless of whether EVM assembly optimization is enabled or not:
- `pop()` easily gets optimized out making tests useless -> replaced with `mstore()` or `sstore()`.
- CLI does not let us test stack optimization without the whole optimizer enabled -> tests converted to Standard JSON ones.
    - See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10286#discussion_r621341134.
- Added `sstore()` in linker tests to prevent the library addresses from being optimized out.
- Stack reuse tests in `EVMCodeTransformTest` get mostly optimized out. Now they run with optimizer disabled (except for stack optimization).
