The entire Info part is ready, what's missing is to actually change something to Info so that tools can test it.

After some back and forth with @cameel , we decided:
- To keep the error "type" as strings going into `formatError` inside `StandardCompiler`, since those are very local to `StandardCompiler` itself and do not warrant specific error types in the `Error::Type` enum.
- What `StandardCompiler::formatError` use to take as a Boolean (is warning or not), was changed into the newly created `Error:Category`. This is now used accordingly throughout `StandardCompiler`.
- The helper `isError` was created and used accordingly

This is ready for review again.

I do not see any commits since yesterday, only that the comments were set to resolved. @cameel do you see any commits?

And the lines
```
      // Mandatory ("error" or "warning")
      "severity": "error",
```
at https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#output-description should also be changed.

Well, I last reviewed it like a month ago so I was really comparing to that state :) The stuff that's left now is just tweaking the docs, moving a function, renaming some stuff, etc. Which is why I'm not approving yet but none of this seems like a big blocker.
