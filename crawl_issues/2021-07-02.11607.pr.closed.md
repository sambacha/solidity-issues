This pull request fixes the parser grammar written in ANTLR4 format. Details are as follows:
 (1) function call option should be accepted only once, according to the Solidity v0.8.0 Breaking Changes: New Restrictions (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/080-breaking-changes.html#new-restrictions)
 (2) unary + operator should be disallowed, according to the Solidity v0.5.0 Breaking Changes: Syntax (https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/050-breaking-changes.html#syntax)

The tests show that we also need another case for "newExpression". Furthermore, the compiler currently performs the check that call options are only provided once at the type checker level, so maybe we cannot strengthen the grammar in a way that works on all examples in the same way as the compiler does.

I saw that some tests failed on CircleCI but it seems I do not have the permission to browse everything, so couldn't see the detailed code where it failed. Would it be possible to share this case for "newExpression" and maybe also other test codes? I would like to try to make this work.

You can run `scripts/test_antlr_grammar.sh` locally to see if it works or not. The new expresion is `new A{value: 2}()`.

I have revised the grammar. It should pass the tests now.

I'm sorry, but I don't think the reduction in readability through the repetition is worth the gains in better reflecting the actual syntax. There many other details about the syntax that cannot be caught in a context-free grammar.

@chriseth does that mean you think the PR should be modified? Or just not accepted?
