#### Test program: small.sol
```solidity
contract C {

solc-trunk-asan_ubsan --optimize small.sol
```
#### Output
```
Internal compiler error during compilation:
/solidity/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp(1683): Throw in function virtual unsigned int solidity::frontend::ArrayType::calldataEncodedSize(bool) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Array size does not fit unsigned.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Array size does not fit unsigned.

FYI may be a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8382. I'm guessing the line number in `Types.cpp` is different because the code shifted a bit.

Yes, it's the same issue and the error happens on the same line. So I'm going to close it since #8382 is still open.
