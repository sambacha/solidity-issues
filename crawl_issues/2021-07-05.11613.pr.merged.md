I don't think it's good to just copy the list here. I think most users will be fine if we say "put it in `deps/lib` or install it globall in your system. If you put it in deps/lib, it will be found if you run the tests from a directory depth of 3 but not further".

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11613#discussion_r663867862 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11613#discussion_r663867964 still need to be addressed. Other than that, it looks fine to me.

I think especially https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11613#issuecomment-874060700 has to be addressed.
