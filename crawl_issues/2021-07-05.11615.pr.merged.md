Actually, at some point, I did store the "exit layout" of each operation in the ``StackLayout`` (i.e. the layout immediately after the operation before the potential shuffling towards the entry layout of the next operation)... but it turns out that information isn't useful in the end, so I dropped it... for the purpose of displaying it in these test cases, it'd probably have been nice, though :-).

I just pushed another tiny change that just switches the order of cases in ``dupDeepSlotIfRequired`` - if the deep slot itself needs fixing, we always need to fix it right away, even if that slot occurs again later, so the old ``else`` case needs to have precedence - that will fix the fuzzer issues reported in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493#issuecomment-904464775

EDIT: and then just rebased to fix unrelated CI issues.

The last commit adds one more special case to the stack shuffling to avoid more stack-too-deeps:
If I want to swap the current stack top to a lower slot, that's too low to be reachable right now, I don't just give up right away, but look for the deepest reachable to-be-popped slot and move the top there temporarily. (The next iteration can then pop and we have a smaller stack in which things hopefully work out).
