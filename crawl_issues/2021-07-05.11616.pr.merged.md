Since this depends on #11605 I changed the base branch to it but changes from that PR still show through - this PR needs a rebase.

BTW, would be nice to have branch names that are not just the issue number. Or at least have some unique name before the number so that I don't have to remember the number to get branch name completion :)

`b_bytecode_ems` is failing:
```
Compiling all test contracts into bytecode...
  File "/home/circleci/project/scripts/isolate_tests.py", line 61
    return indent(f"{{\n{code.rstrip()}\n}}\n\n", "    ")
                                               ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Looks like the script is being executed using on older version of Python that did not support f-strings. They were added in Python 3.6. W should really get a newer version but if it's only the f-string that is a problem, you can just switch back to `format()`:
```python
    return indent(f"{{\n{}\n}}\n\n".format(code.rstrip()), "    ")
```
