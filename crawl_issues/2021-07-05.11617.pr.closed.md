# [\#11617 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11617) `closed`: Stripping base path from CLI paths (without CLI refactor)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-05 19:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11617):

Fixes #4702.
Implements the `solc` part of #11408. `solc-js` changes will be submitted in that repo.

This is a version of #11545 that does not depend on the CLI refactor PRs (#11518, #11520, #11544) and does not include test cases for the CLI.

Things that were not implemented or were implemented differently than specified in the issue:
- Extra normalization: on Windows drive letter is removed from the path if possible.
- On case-sensitive case-preserving filesystems does **not** use the case from disk.
    - I couldn't find any portable way to get the original case. I know how to detect that it differs using Boost though so I am going to propose issuing a warning for this instead (#11412).

In case anyone is wondering why this is so much more complex than my initial PR, here's a non-exhaustive list of path-related weirdness it has to account for:
- `/a/b/c` on Windows is a relatve path. Only `C:/a/b/c` (or `C:\a\b\c`) is absolute.
- A path consisting only of a drive letter (`C:`) is relative and not equivalent to the path to the root directory (`C:\`, `\` or `/`).
- If the path to the working directory contains symlinks, `absolute()` creates an absolute path that may or may not have these links resolved.
    - On macOS they are resolved and `/var/` (which contains the tmp dir in my tests) is a symlink to `/private/var/`.
    - On Windows they are not resolved.
- On Windows it is possible for `/` and `\` to represent two different directory trees.
    - This is actually the case on CircleCI Windows machines. They have `C:\Program Files\Git\` mounted at `/`. See also [Where is the Git Bash `/` directory?](https://superuser.com/questions/1192563/where-is-the-git-bash-directory)
- Windows does support symbolic links. But:
    - There is a special type of symlink for directories. A non-directory symlink can still point at a directory, but it is not recognized as a directory (you can't use it as a part of a path for example).
    - If the symlink target is a relative path, only `\` works as a path separator. If it's absolute, both `/` and `\` work.
- Boost's `canonical()` and `weakly_canonical()` both resolve symlinks. There's no direct equivalent that does not.
- Boost's `lexically_normal()` does not convert `/../../a/b/c` into `/a/b/c`. It has to be done manually.
- Boost's normalization always includes drive letter in Windows paths. This makes canonical normalized paths different on different between Windows and other platforms. Drive letters need to be stripped manually.
- [UNC paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)#UNC) (e.g. `//host/b/c` or `\\host\b\c` on Windows) are relative despite having a root name.
- On Windows, when the current directory is an UNC path, `\` is not a valid path (at least in the shell) and does not refer to the root directory.
- Making an UNC path absolute results in the current path being appended at the end rather than at the beginning like with normal paths.
- Even though duplicate path separators (`a//b/c.sol`) and `.` at the end of a path (`a/b/c/.`) are ignored when Boost compares paths, they are still stored in the `path` object.

Did not review the actual code.

Similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11544#issuecomment-885991707, I'm adding some refactors and small changes from work on  #11688 as fixups (previous fixups squashed). Again, functionality did not change and almost all the changes were just in tests:
- Docstring tweaks: document that `isPathPrefix()` ignores the trailing slash and that `normalizeCLIPathForVFS()` always adds a slash after `.` + test cases for this.
- `dotDotPrefix` moved moved to a better spot in in `normalizeCLIPathForVFS()` (does not affect functionality).
- Unused code removed from case-sensitivity test.
- Root name stripping test now is not completely skipped outside of Windows (helps to make sure it at least compiles).
- `TEST_CASE_NAME`.
- `BOOST_TEST()` replaced with `BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL()` when comparing paths. The former for some reason does not print `boost::filesystem::path` values when a test fails, which makes debugging CI failures much more tedious.
    - Extra parentheses removed from `BOOST_TEST()` in a few cases where the `<<` operator actually exists (these parentheses were a way to make the the macro not try to print stuff).

I'm closing this in favor of #11545. The only point of this PR was to be able to merge it without having to review all the dependencies first. Now that the dependencies are already merged, there's no point in keeping it around.

I kept these PRs in sync at all times so if you already reviewed this, the only extra thing to review in #11545 is `test/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp`.
