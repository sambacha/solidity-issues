# [\#11625 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11625) `closed`: Make --pretty-json work with Standard JSON output

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4614909?v=4" width="50">[sladecek](https://github.com/sladecek) opened issue at [2021-07-06 19:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11625):

My attempt to solve #11583. The command-line option  '--pretty-json' works both for '--standard-json' and '--combined-json'. There is a new option '--pretty-json-indent' which defines indentation level with default value 2.

Fixes #11583

Great! Thanks for the PR! I'll do a proper review tomorrow but here's some general feedback for now:
- Could you rebase your code on #11518? That PR is going to be merged soon and it will conflict with yours. It moves a lot of stuff from `CommandLineInterface` to a separate class and adds tests.
- Not sure about the new option. Why not just do `--pretty-json=N`? `boost::program_options` can handle that. You can make the value `optional` and only assign to it if the option is specified.
- Please use `uint32_t` or `uint8_t` or a similar type with platform-independent size rather than `unsigned`. Otherwise external tools don't have a clear range of values to use for validations (this came up for example in https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/1589). We currently do use `unsigned` for another parameter (`--runs`) but we should really change that too.

Also, your PR looks like a complete solution for #11583 so you should put `Fixes #11583` in your first comment. This will close that issue automatically once we merge it.

I'd also leave the issue number out of the PR title. I don't think it helps that much. We don't know all these numbers by heart anyway :) Putting it in the description is enough. Same goes for commit description - it spams the issue with a lot of useless entries when rebasing so we do not do that (please see how it looks on the issue page now :)).

Thank you for the quick feedback. I'll try to address all the issues. The new option was added to allow adding more pretty print parameters other than indent.

@sladecek I see you closed the PR. It looks like it might have been closed automatically by github because of a rebase. If that's the case, please reopen or just open a new one.

Hi Kamil.

I am working on it. The PR has been closed automatically because I
force-pushed another local branch.
