~~Still needs at least a test case.~~ Added test.

Didn't we want to put some mechanism into place to prevent this kind of thing :-)?

I'm happy for any mechanism that prevents this. We have to take the name of the current function into account and something like equality comparison on all the arguments.

Yeah, the reason why we don't have one yet, is probably that it's rather tricky to come up with a really nice and automatic one... the C++ Reflection TS would help and it would even be enough if any single compiler had a released version of it - one failing CI test run would already be enough - but it seems like both gcc and clang still keep their implementation of that on separate branches.
The only ugly-but-half-decent other option I see would be to define a macro to be used to defining these functions...
So instead of
```
string YulUtilFunctions::negateNumberWrappingFunction(Type const& _type)
{
...
}
```
we'd have to use something like
```
DECLARE_YUL_UTIL_FUNCTION(string, negateNumberWrappingFunction, Type const& _type)
{
...
}
```
Or we change the calling convention, s.t. ``m_utils.negateNumberWrappingFunction(type)`` has to go through a macro, but that's probably even more annoying, since autocompletion will probably be gone - albeit that way it'd be easier to guarantee that it's always done compared to us at least having to make sure that all these functions are in fact declared using the macro...

If we say, that's ugly, but better than having to be afraid of these bugs, I can write something like that...

Or alternatively: I'm not actually sure if it's actually worth it to avoid regenerating these functions on each call... if we'd be fine with that we could also simply have ``m_functionCollector.createFunction`` run the generator each time and, if we have already stored a function of the same name, just use string comparison to verify that it's the same one I guess. Might be worth checking, if that has any noticable performance impact (or maybe we did that and that's why we have the caching in the first place?).

Oh interesting, this seems to be actually happen in ``prbmath_signed`` and changes its gas costs!

That sounds like a good approach, but how do we handle functions again generated from that function?

Shouldn't something like this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11635 be enough? It's based on ``develop`` before this being merged and it should catch this bug in the ``pbrmath`` test...
