## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/internals/layout_in_storage.html#bytes-and-string

Chapter: Internals
Section: Layout of State Variables in Storage
Phase: Mappings and Dynamic Arrays > `bytes` and `string`

## Abstract

> ...
> `bytes` and `string` are encoded identically. In general, the encoding is similar to `byte1[]`, in the sense that there is a slot for the array itself and a data area that is computed using a `keccak256` hash of that slotâ€™s position. However, for short values (shorter than 32 bytes) the array elements are stored together with the length in the same slot.
> ...

Type `byte1` doesn't exist, as the screenshot shows:

This is a typo that should be fixed to `bytes1[]` instead.
