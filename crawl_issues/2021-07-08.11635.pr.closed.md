Hm... independently of runtime concerns, the ``constant_`` functions seem to generate different variable names on each invocation...
We could of course parse into an AST and check for syntactic equality, but at some point it becomes silly :-D.

Hm - not sure it's worth it trying to deal with recursion, runtime and different variable names in this...

Maybe some approach that just checks that names uniquely relate to the function name and arguments using some ugly macro is saner after all :-)?

I think it's fine to check that
 - the name of the C++ function gets uniquely mapped to a yul function name prefix and
 - all C++ function arguments somehow get mentioned in the expression that generates the name

Maybe this can be done using an independent test script somewhere without ugly macros?

Learning learning learning, but not quick enough

Closing this, since we need to do this differently anyways.
