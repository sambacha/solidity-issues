# [\#11639 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11639) `merged`: Make --pretty-json work with Standard JSON output

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4614909?v=4" width="50">[sladecek](https://github.com/sladecek) opened issue at [2021-07-08 17:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11639):

My attempt to solve #11583. The command-line option '--pretty-json' works both for '--standard-json' and '--combined-json'. There is a new option '--pretty-json-indent' which defines indentation level with default value 2.

Fixes #11583

Also, when you're done please squash the review fixes and rebase on `develop`.

The commits are rebased on ``develop`` and most of them are squashed. I left only the last round.

Looks like something went wrong with rebase here. I re-rebased it on `develop` now.
