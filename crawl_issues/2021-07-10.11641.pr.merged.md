Oh... everything passed in soltest on my original branch. I naively did not run soltest again after rebasing; didn't think I'd need to. But I'm getting soltest errors after the rebase onto develop.

edit: Oh, soltest is failing on my local develop branch again; I dunno what keeps happening. I am thoroughly confused at this point.

It's not `soltest`. It's the command-line tests. Try running them locally with `test/cmdlineTests.sh`.

I see that the failure happens while compiling one of the snippets from documentation (specifically one from the page on [Inline Assembly](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/assembly.html)). Until recently we have been testing only Solidity snippets but just before the weekend a PR that adds testing for Yul snippets too has been merged (#11616). It did pass all tests but there's always a possibility that some other PR went in the meantime and tests do not pass after merge. Please check if it fails also on `develop` or only in your branch.

To debug it, take a look at the command the script runs:
```bash
"/root/project/build/solc/solc" --strict-assembly /tmp/tmp.dc0WgaSphP/test_4111f9d52bcf44f413fb3fcc0ff8e02cb0c1715326b663fb25548cd05709b13a_assembly_rst.yul
```

You should be able to run that manually and check what's happening. `cmdlineTests.sh` should leave the files in `/tmp` it if fails. But if it does not, you can also get the set of input files it uses by running `scripts/isolate_tests.sh`.

The command line test failure is not due to your PR. Try rebasing on #11644 (or wait till it is merged into develop), that should fix it.

@TerranCivilian Are you still working on the PR? The current solution is good in my opinion so the only thing this needs before it can get merged is a rebase on `develop`.

Hey, sorry, I've recently been much more busy outside of work. I can try to finish now. I never really figured out how my branch got messed up or why the CircleCI tests were failing. I think I will just re-clone.

@TerranCivilian It turned out that the breakage was caused by an unrelated PR merged into `develop`. As I said above, simply rebasing your PR on `develop` should be enough to make tests pass get make your PR mergeable.

Hm, I think I messed up again; here's exactly what I just did:

1. Went to my GitHub solidity repo at https://github.com/TerranCivilian/solidity
2. Fetched + merged upstream
3. Went to my local repo with develop checkout out and did:
  a. `git fetch`
  b. `git pull`
  c. `git checkout src-hash-CommonIO-fix`
  d. `git rebase develop`
  e. `git push -f`

Did I do it wrong? Or is develop messed up again

No, it's all fine. It actually proves that your PR does its job :) Tests are failing because my PRs went into `develop` in the meantime and they added some tests that include the expected content of stdin among other things. Now that your PR is on top of that, you need to update expectations in these tests - they should no longer expect a newline on stdin - they can assume it's empty when nothing was passed on it.

So basically just go over `t_ubu_soltest`, look at where the problem is in each failing case (there's a file name and line number) and update the test.

> a. `git fetch`
> b. `git pull`

You do not need both. `pull` is just `fetch` + `merge`. I personally never use `pull`. `fetch` is convenient because it's safe to do at any time (it does not modify my checked out branch) and then I can just merge if I see that the branch can be safely fast forwarded.

> d. `git rebase develop`

Use `git rebase develop --interactive`. It will let you review commits before rebase and you can abort if something's not right.

This way you can also drop commits that are not yours - there could be some if your PR is based on some other branch and this branch is force pushed with modified commits. git would then think that those old versions of commits in your branch are actually your own commits and include them in the rebase. Without `--interactive` (or even with `--interactive if you do not drop these commits) you'll just get weird conflicts in that case.

> e. `git push -f`

I'd recommend to always use `git push --force-with-lease` instead of `--force`. It ensures that if someone pushed to your branch in the meantime, git will tell you instead of silently overwriting his changes.

Just noticed that your PR is missing a changelog entry. You should mention your fix in [Changelog.md](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md).

I have rebased this on `develop` and fixed test expectations. If tests pass, I think we can merge this.
