Fixes #11390

Need to fix evmone CI issues.

I really fix that just like with Berlin, this shouldn't be a single large PR, but rather:
1) evmc/evmone
2) london support + basefee

I would merge 1) now, but would not merge 2) before the hardfork goes live (~3 weeks from now).

@axic I'll split this up, once I can get the CI working.

About the second part, why not add `london` to `evm-version`, while keep berlin as the default, and add `basefee`? We can change the default to london once the hardfork is live.

It worked before when we could mark those as "experimental", but you have removed that option ðŸ˜…

This looks good to me, though:
1) Would still wait the extra week until London goes live and only merge this after.
2) Clean up the commits a tiny bit (e.g. the commit "Updated evmone version to 0.8.0 and evmc version to 9.0.0" has nothing to do with what it says)

Why wait? As long as we do not change the default evm version it should be fine.

Because if the fork falls through there's just extra stuff to be removed. It is really one week away so makes little difference in terms of "stalled PRs" waiting that out :)

Excited about this - is there any way to access the block BASEFEE before this is merged & a new version is released?

@azf20 Currently the only way is to use `verbatim` in Yul. There is an example in https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement/ about `basefee` using `verbatim`.

... but you unfortunately cannot use it in inline assembly.
