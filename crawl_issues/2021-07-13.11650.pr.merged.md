# [\#11650 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11650) `merged`: Use `boost::filesystem::path` in `readFileAsString()`

Small refactor of `readFileAsString()` requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11544#discussion_r667943576.

Originally the function accepted the path as `std::string`, now it's `boost::filesystem::path`.

I think this may have been a conscious decision to keep boost's presence limited. I guess now there's an implicit constructor from string in cases it does not receive a path? Does having `boost/filesystem` in `CommonIO.h` gives any measurable compilation time effect? Also note that all the other path helpers in `CommonIO.h` such as `absolutePath` and `sanitizePath` still use strings, so one should decide whether we go all-in on `boost::filesystem` and change all of these, but should avoid the case where we have a mix.

I am not campaigning against this, but the change seems to have some other cleanups, and in the end we trade a single `.string()` at the caller side for using `.string()` four times within the helper.

I partly agree here, @axic. I do remember though that I was once motivated to use `boost::filesystem::path` over `std::string`. I do not like boost and was once pushing for `std::filesystem`, but that wasn't possible at that time, because OS/X was lagging behind. Maybe that has changed? Actually it has, but what OS/X versions do we want to support?

I however prefer (`std::`)`filesystem::path` usage, as I at least assumed the string ctor is not implicit (maybe a boost-only thing?)

I would have actually approved this PR, but your comment made me hold back, axic. Maybe we want to re-evaluate the use of std::filesystem again?

Yeah. `path` -> `string` conversion is unambiguous so it's implicit. It's the other way around where there are several possibilities (`string()`, `generic_string()`, `native()`).

> Does having `boost/filesystem` in `CommonIO.h` gives any measurable compilation time effect?

I doubt it because it's not a header-only library. I did not notice any egregious change but I'd have to measure it to be sure how much it adds.

> Also note that all the other path helpers in `CommonIO.h` such as `absolutePath` and `sanitizePath` still use strings, so one should decide whether we go all-in on `boost::filesystem` and change all of these, but should avoid the case where we have a mix.

I saw them and I left them unchanged on purpose. They are not generic path functions, they're meant for our VFS paths with all the quirks like `../x.sol` relative to `/a/b/../` resolving into `/a/b/x.sol`. We should not put that into `path`. I think that having them in `CommonIO` is highly misleading and I was going to move them to `ImportRemapper` or `CompilerStack` or a new VFS-specific class when I get to changing that part.

> I am not campaigning against this, but the change seems to have some other cleanups, and in the end we trade a single `.string()` at the caller side for using `.string()` four times within the helper.

For me it's about the interface. I highly prefer to see a path type where an actual path is expected (could be `std::filesystem::path` but for now we only have `boost::filesystem::path`). The fact that we have internal VFS paths that work kinda like paths but not quite is bad enough and we should clearly distinguish them. I'm also not sure we can really always treat `path` -> `string` -> `path` conversion that is required otherwise as lossless.

> I would have actually approved this PR, but your comment made me hold back, axic. Maybe we want to re-evaluate the use of `std::filesystem` again?

I think it's risky. There are subtle differences between the two that affect normalization (see for example https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/88#issuecomment-435102621) and I think we do not have enough test coverage related to paths to just swap one with another and expect things not to be broken in some way. The new stuff I'm adding is covered pretty extensively but the existing code mostly is not.

@axic @christianparpart any conclusions here after @cameel 's comment?

I'm fine with actual filesystem functions using boost::filesystem

Can we get this merged?
