Came up while looking at `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/abiEncoderV2/calldata_array_dynamic_static_short_reencode.sol` (since that's a test with high stack pressure).

At the time of writing, the following passes as "full optimizer suite" test:
```
{
    let tail := 42
    for { let i := 0 } lt(i,5) { i := add(i, 1) }
    {
	let pos := tail
        pos := tail
	let tail_1 := tail
	for { let j := 0 } lt(j,6) { j := add(j, i) } {
		pos := add(pos, 2)
	}
	tail := tail_1
    }
}
// ----
// step: fullSuite
//
// {
//     {
//         let tail := 42
//         let i := 0
//         let i_1 := i
//         for { } lt(i_1, 5) { i_1 := add(i_1, 1) }
//         {
//             let pos := tail
//             pos := tail
//             let j := i
//             for { } lt(j, 6) { j := add(j, i_1) }
//             { pos := add(pos, 2) }
//             tail := tail
//         }
//     }
// }
```
(Note that both ``i`` and ``j`` can be removed and the loop conditions replaced by e.g. ``1`` or ``callvalue()`` for similar results, I just put them in to have the test case not be too artificial)

Both ``pos := tail`` and ``tail := tail`` are redundant.
Actually, even more so, ``pos`` and ``tail`` are even entirely redundant and could be eliminated altogether :-).

My guess is that due to the loops, this will never end up in a nice SSA form and thus the redundant assign eliminator cannot work properly, but I haven't investigated in full.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
