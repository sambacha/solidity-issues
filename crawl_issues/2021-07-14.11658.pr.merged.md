It seems that this can even be further simplified so that the parser constructs the scanner itself.

Someone can gladly take this over. I don't think it is complicated. The idea is to replace `Scanner` by `CharStream` everywhere except in the parser. The parser can construct an instance of `Scanner` itself which does not have to be long-lived.
