# [\#11659 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11659) `merged`: Fix broken bullet points in docs caused by a bug in dependencies of `sphinx-rtd-theme`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-14 11:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11659):

Styling in our documentation is slightly broken due to https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/1115. Most noticeably, bullet points are not displayed for unordered lists.

This does not affect docs built using the `scripts/docs.sh` script but the docs at https://docs.soliditylang.org are not built using that.

Here are the commands to reproduce this problem locally (based on [build log #14231164 from readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/api/v2/build/14231164.txt)):

```
virtualenv venv-solidity-docs/
source venv-solidity-docs/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir "mock==1.0.1" "pillow==5.4.1" "alabaster>=0.7,<0.8,!=0.7.5" "commonmark==0.8.1" "recommonmark==0.5.0" "sphinx<2" "sphinx-rtd-theme<0.5" "readthedocs-sphinx-ext<2.2"
pip install --exists-action=w --no-cache-dir -r docs/requirements.txt
cd docs
sphinx-build -n -b html -d _build/doctrees . _build/html
```
The commands should be executed from repo root.
