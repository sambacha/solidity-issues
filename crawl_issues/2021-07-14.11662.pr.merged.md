# [\#11662 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11662) `merged`: [Docs] Fix highlighting and always use latest packages

Depends on #11660 (I put whitespace changes in a separate PR because they add tons of noise).

The main point of this PR is to make `b_docs` job in CI use latest versions of Python packages, in particular `Pygments`. Locally I get a lot of errors from the highlighter but they do not appear in CI. Turns out it's because the image we use (`solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps:ubuntu2004-6`) has an old version of Sphinx with its dependencies in it and `pip` by default does not update a package unless it absolutely has to.

To be able to do this I had to fix these highlighting errors though. Looks like the lexer has a lot of problems parsing fairly mundane stuff like `&&`, `||`, `? :`, `1e18` or `pragma solidity >x.y.z;`. In case of pragmas I fixed it by switching to `>=` but for others I just had to use `:force:` to make it continue despite errors. This is the same thing I noticed with `assembly` blocks in #11420. `pygments-lexer-solidity` does not seem actively maintained so we'll probably have to fix it ourselves eventually.

While doing it I also found some `::` style blocks, apparently missed in #11477 so I converted them. Some existing blocks were also labeled with wrong language. Finally, I enabled highlighting for some of our JSON blocks (especially the Standard JSON input/output). They did have some syntax errors I had to fix (missing commas or quotes) and also I highlight them as `javascript` rather than `json` because comments are technically not valid in JSON and the highliter does not accept them.
