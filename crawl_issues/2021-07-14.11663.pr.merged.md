# [\#11663 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11663) `merged`: Remove deprecated escapes from docs + rename `escapeAndQuoteYulString()`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-14 19:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11663):

In #11575 I mistakenly renamed `escapeAndQuoteString()` to `escapeAndQuoteYulString()` (I was convinced that the escapes were only removed from Yul, not Solidity). This PR fixes that and also updates some comments.

While at it I also noticed we still list these escapes in the docs as usable in strings so the PR also removes them.
