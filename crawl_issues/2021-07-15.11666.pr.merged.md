# [\#11666 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11666) `merged`: Sphinx extension for rendering `robots txt`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-15 11:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11666):

Continuation of #10898.
Related to #11199, #11317, #11592.

After [`robots.txt` at docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/robots.txt) reverted to its default content after we merged #11317. Apparently that's because docs hosted at ReadTheDocs are built independenty and do not use our `docs.sh` script (#11659).

This PR replaces the `robots.txt` rendering script with a very simple Sphinx extension that can render templates using Jinja2 templating engine used by Sphinx itself.

I hope it does not break on readthedocs due to package versions or something. It does work for me locally but you can never be sure with this stuff :) When we merge it we should be prepared to do a quick fix in case it does not.

Looks like the new `robots.txt` did not get picked up: https://docs.soliditylang.org/robots.txt

@chriseth Do you have the build log I could look at?

Isn't it public? https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/builds/14247942/

Ah, true. I thought you had to know the URL but looks like the whole index is public. Thanks!

Looks like it's indeed ignoring `robots.txt`:
> WARNING: unknown mimetype for robots.txt, ignoring
> WARNING: unknown mimetype for _static/robots.txt, ignoring

Not sure why this is happening. Maybe it's because outdated packages as usual? :)

Looking closer, these warnings only show up for `epub` so that's not it.

I don't think there's anything wrong with generating the file.
Looking at [Custom `robots.txt` Pages](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hosting.html#custom-robots-txt-pages) I see two other possible causes:
1. Is `latest` marked as the default version of the docs? If not, we'll only see the new `robots.txt` when it gets to the default version. 
    - When I go to https://docs.soliditylang.org, it redirects me to 0.8.6 so I think that's the problem.
2. RTD has some special rules for `robots.txt` becuse multiple docs versions could have it and it needs to pick one and put it at the domain root. If it's picking up the location of `robots.txt` by loading `conf.py` independently of Sphinx (rather than by looking for the file in the `_build/` directory) it might just be not noticing it. My extension modifies `html_extra_path` setting at runtime to add the file there.
    - Originally I wanted to leave the file hard-coded in `html_extra_path` but that triggers a warning about a missing file because static files get validated before my extension even has a chance to run. This happens only for formats other than HTML though.

Can you explain why https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/robots.txt is also not updated?

Like I said on the channel, I think the server is intercepting all URLs that end with `robots.txt` and serving the file from the domain root for them. Try for example this: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/devedfdasdfasdfsadfasdflop/dsafasfasdfsad2342342434we/rwewerwrobots.txt. It should not even be an existing path.
