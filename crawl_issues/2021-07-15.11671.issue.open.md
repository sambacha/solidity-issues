**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `solcbin`, `low impact`

Originally reported in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/issues/537 but it looks like more of a solc-bin issue than solc-js one.

The asm.js binary for 0.4.25 seems broken. Crashes for me on node.js 14 and 16. Only works with 12. Wasm version does not have this problem.
