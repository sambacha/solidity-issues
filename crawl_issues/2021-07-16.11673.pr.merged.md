@cameel disappeared in what way? I had to remove a bunch because the MacOS version gives many different results compared to the Linux ones, very annoying...

Yea I had to remove many of those because MacOS is different.

@cameel `b_docs` actually fails here without sphinx it seems

Which is weird because it doesn't fail for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11672

Oh. The problem is that the docs produce quite a lot of warnings right now and `docs.sh` runs Sphinx with "treat warnings as errors" so it fails. The only reason they were not showing up on `develop` was because of old Pygments and Sphinx versions. After you removed Sphinx from the image, `pip` now actually installs latest versions of packages because it cannot fall back on older ones being already present. So this effectively solves the same problem as my #11662 but without fixing the warnings.

Sorry, I did not take that into account. In that case I see 2 solutions:
1. Review and merge #11660 and #11662 before this PR.
2. Ignore it for now and put Sphinx back in the image. I'll remove it later when the warnings are already fixed. We'll be doing EVMC update soon and I think that requires rebuilding images too so I can remove it then.

By the way, it does not fail in #11672 because there CI does not yet use the new images (it still has the old hashes).

@cameel This works now with the current version of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11672
