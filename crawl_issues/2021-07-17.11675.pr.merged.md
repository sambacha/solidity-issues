# [\#11675 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11675) `merged`: Remove incorrect statement that calldata must be used for external functions

I have tested this locally and am still able to compile and run unit tests for projects which have external functions that take `bytes memory` instead of `bytes calldata`. I believe this statement is incorrect and should be removed. Happy to take feedback on how we could reword this instead of flat out removing :)

Aight looked into this a little deeper. This line was true up until solc 0.6.9 was released (although this change was never mentioned in the changelog). I'm not really familiar with ReadTheDocs but will try to update this PR to affect all doc revisions >=0.6.9

Will convert to draft for now

Hmm i'm not sure how to make a change like this apply to past versions of the docs, but this should update the latest version? 

Sorry to waste your time reviewers, but could use a bit of guidance üòÖ

We do not generally update old versions of the docs. They're always exactly what you can find in the repo under the version tag. Your change will appear in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/ and later in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/ once a new version is released.

If you want to view your changes locally, try running `scripts/docs.sh` from repo root. In case there's a problem with Python packages, try in a clean virtualenv (should work as long as you have a recent enough version of Python available):
```bash
rm -r docs/_build/
python -m virtualenv venv-solidity-docs/
source venv-solidity-docs/bin/activate
scripts/docs.sh
xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html
```

Hmm I see, although that wording doesn't necessarily imply that memory would be allowed for external functions. Maybe that's a natural implicit assumption for some people ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üòÖ

Actually, looks like you're right about the missing changelog after all. I focused on the fact that it does mention `calldata` for all variables but it really does not say that external functions can use `memory` now. Not even the blog article mentions it: [Solidity 0.6.9 Release Announcement > Calldata Variables](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2020/06/05/solidity-069-release-announcement/#calldata-variables)

Well, it's not easy to keep the changelog concise. You always have to omit some details and sometimes it's hard decide which ones are unimportant :) In any case thanks for spotting it in the docs!

Alright @cameel, have removed the offending line and moved the info about it being preferred for external functions into an existing note (that I also moved up as I felt it was more important for readers than the one previously above it).
