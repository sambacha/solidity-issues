# [\#11685 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11685) `closed`: Fix remappings with empty targets

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-24 00:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11685):

[Remapping docs in 0.8.4](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/layout-of-source-files.html#use-in-actual-compilers) (i.e. even before my rewrite) state:

> For solc (the commandline compiler), you provide these path remappings as `context:prefix=target` arguments, where both the `context:` and the `=target` parts are optional (`target` defaults to `prefix` in this case).

This is not true. Something like `/a/b/c/=` on the command line currently results in `/a/b/c/contract.sol` being replaced with `contract.sol`. This PR fixes that.

Alternatively we could also just change the docs - removing a prefix might actually be more useful than a no-op. In either case it's an obscure corner case so we could also just disallow it and always require an explicit target.

The docs used to contain also this which is false as well:

> All remapping values that are regular files are compiled (including their dependencies).

Running `solc contractA.sol=contractB.sol` results in `No input files given.`. Neither `contractA.sol` nor `contractB.sol` gets compiled. It's the same as far back as 0.5.0 and before then I think remappings must have not been supported because I get no output and a non-zero exit code (even if a file called `contractA.sol=contractB.sol` exists).

Since this part is no longer in the docs, I did not add this behavior.

Right. I totally missed the `=` there and that `` `target` defaults to `prefix` `` only applies to this particular case. After my rewrite this nuance is completely lost. In that case I'm closing this and I'll submit a PR to clarify the docs instead.
