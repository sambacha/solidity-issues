Depends on #11545 (draft until that one's merged).

Just a bunch of minor improvements I found useful while working on the PR for `--allow-paths`:
- `TemporaryDirectory` constructor can now create empty subdirectories inside the temp dir. I really need this to be able to have a `TemporaryWorkingDirectory` instance initialized with a subdirectory as a member variable in a fixture.
- Automatic conversion to `boost::filesystem::path()` so so that the object can be used as a path. Unfortunately this conversion only works in simple cases. You still can't use it with `/` operator or to call `path`'s methods.
- Some cleanup (plain `assert()` and `fs` namespace alias for `boost::filesystem` removed).
- `TEST_CASE_NAME` macros in individual tests to avoid hard-coding test name but still keep it concise.
