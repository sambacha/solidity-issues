# [\#11697 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11697) `merged`: Sphinx extension for adding Remix links to code snippets

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-26 18:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11697):

Fixes #11415.

The PR adds a local Sphinx extension that encodes snippets into links and puts a small Remix icon in the top-right corner of every box with highlighted Solidity code.

A few remarks:
- I think it looks decent and works in both dark and light mode. If anyone wants to try and make it look more appealing though, feel free to push more commits to the PR.
- I tried to add a `title` attribute to the link but eventually gave up so the link has no description if you hover over it. I'd have to dig deeper into docutils to find out how to do it (if it's supported at all).
    - I could also use an `<img>` tag instead of CSS background and add `alt` text. I did not want to do it that way because semantically the image is just pure style here. I think it's better if restyling does not require touching Python code.
- Yul snippets get skipped. Not sure if Remix supports those.

Here's how it looks like now:

I just checked epub as requested in the issue and unfortunately this extension does affect the output in a bad way:

![solidity-snippet-epub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/127042366-ac2460c7-7e5a-4228-8f49-9f39e9dee744.png)

I tried to disable it for this format but looks like epub still uses the HTML builder so I need to find a better way to filter it out. I'll go back to this later, for now I'm switching the PR to draft.

@chriseth I could add a small `REMIX` or `OPEN` below but I think that the whole `open in remix` would be too long. I think it would be better as a tooltip (via `title` attribute) but unfortunately I do not know yet how to add it via Sphinx API.

Maybe it would be better to just design or find a better icon? I asked @franzihei about it today and she said she'll try to come up with something.

Yeah, a new icon also sounds good - it should maybe contain an arrow or something...

I tried out some stuff and I think the Remix logo might be a bit too much. I tend to just using an icon that everybody understands, like an arrow or a similar "open in"/share icon. 

I think we could even get rid of the text then. Here are some ideas:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41991517/127191427-d3a4f2af-fca6-4d1a-9db8-abff7bc1617e.png)

We can't do a hover or can we? If yes, it would be great if we could show "open in Remix" when hovering over the icon and then we didn't need the text.

I think this could work the best, given it is the smallest, so it won't be distorted as much when scaled down.

Here's a preview. It does not look good due to non-transparent background but at least you can see the final size:

![open-in-remix-icon1-highlighted-block](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/127209146-cf84c12d-8466-434d-a7a0-e9b05958925e.png)

The one without the box is the most minimalistic and looks best to me. Maybe its text should be bigger though.
Actually, if we agree that we do want text there, we could just add it in CSS, it does not have to be a part of the icon unless we want a fancy font.

> We can't do a hover or can we? If yes, it would be great if we could show "open in Remix" when hovering over the icon and then we didn't need the text.

It's possible in HTML but I don't know how to do it through Sphinx API. I have already spent some time trying to figure it out but I eventually gave up because it was starting to take an unreasonable amount of time compared to the rest of the PR. I could try harder if you think it's really essential though.

No it's not necessary imo.

Thank you for the previews in the respective sizes, I think I prefer the 3rd option with the simple arrow. What do you think?

I also like the third one best. Maybe we could alter the font sizes of `open in` and `Remix` so that `Remix` is larger and `open in` a bit smaller? Currently, "Remix~ is just barely readable.

As I said on the call, this is waiting only for a better quality image for the icon, with transparent background (looks like the consensus is that we want the third one) and for a decision regarding https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11697#discussion_r67683671. I think that the URL length limit of 8k chars would be reasonable and all our snippets are under that. With the 2k limit suggested by @axic we have 32 snippets that don't pass (which is why there are CI failures). If we keep the lower limit, we need to decide what to do about these snippets.

The icon can be downloaded here: https://thenounproject.com/term/export/37875/.

We can also use Fontawesome if that's easier, here is a similar icon: https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/share?style=solid

I have added the new icon. Here's how it looks like:

![open-in-remix-icon-font-awesome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/133988097-5c4bea0e-bb5a-44c7-9859-d1b68a6a9a1b.png)

Looks like font awesome requires attribution too after all (there's a pop up saying that when you click the download button). Fortunately it looks like we do have a place for this stuff: [`cmake/templates/license.h.in`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/templates/license.h.in). I added a short note with a link there.

I have also added version and language parameters to the URLs. Looks like the implementation of these features is not yet done in Remix (https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/issues/1489, https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/issues/1490) but currently it simply ignores them so we might want to add them anyway.

Remaining problems:
- The link overlaps the text snippet if the snippet is wide enough to require scrolling. I don't know how to deal with that other than moving the link outside of the box.

    ![open-in-remix-icon-font-awesome-overlapping-code](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/137030/133988101-db12af8a-3ac8-4c6b-842e-81820bf2f128.png)
- We still need a decision about the length limit (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11697#discussion_r67683671).
- In non-release builds the version parameter will contain a non-existent version (e.g. 0.8.8 right now). Not sure if it's better to leave it like this or to only include it in release builds.

We could also add a background to the image/ make it look like an overlay? But then this might make the code behind it not visible anymore, I'm not sure how far it is possible to scroll there.

Yeah, that's the problem. It covers the end of the snippet.

If you want to keep it in the box, we'd need some magic, but none of it seems too great to me:
- Making it transparent on hover: might be weird if you want to click it and then it almost disappears when you hover :)
- Putting it inside the `<pre>` block so that it scrolls with it: might be hard with CSS alone. Also it would add scrollbars in snippets that just barely fit without scrollbars currently.
- Moving the snippet a few lines down when you hover on the link: jumping snippets are not nice.
- Making it appear only when you hover over the code block: this might be the least intrusive option (the "copy text" icons in code blocks on github work that way) but it will make these links harder to discover if you are on mobile and do not have a mouse.

Maybe we should just put it on the right margin of the page? There's some space there, especially if we put text below the icon. Not sure if it will look good though.

From the options outlined this one seems best for me:

> Making it appear only when you hover over the code block: this might be the least intrusive option (the "copy text" icons in code blocks on github work that way) but it will make these links harder to discover if you are on mobile and do not have a mouse.

I don't think people without a mouse will try to do stuff in Remix on their phone, will they?

> Maybe we should just put it on the right margin of the page? There's some space there, especially if we put text below the icon. Not sure if it will look good though.

Where do you mean exactly? Like this?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41991517/134522727-3a183b18-accf-4c1e-a180-852888bfc6bb.png)

If there was a "hover over" option, we could also just show the arrow and show "open in Remix" when hovering over with the mouse.

Then we could consider putting the arrow on the right like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41991517/134522954-d5b7d044-4633-4b7d-9855-cf9039348430.png)

or, if there is enough space on the top like this:

It all doesn't look too perfect, but I guess there aren't many other options available. :/

I think we'd be surprised :) At least Remix does seem to work on my phone just fine so wanting to click such a link and compile the code is not out of the question. And people these days do a lot more stuff on mobile that I'd consider sensible or convenient.

But if you think it's the best option, I can do that anyway.

> Where do you mean exactly? Like this?

Yes. Exactly. Does that look ok? To me it actually looks good in your screenshot.

It's technically possible and there should be a way to do this in Sphinx one way or another. I'd just need to do some digging and experiment because docs on this are very sparse.

Would you prefer this one over the one showing on hover or the one with label?

> or, if there is enough space on the top like this:

This one will be problematic if you don't want an extra empty line to always be there. If the preceding line is long, the icon will overlap

I just tried to make it appear only on hover and it's actually much harder than I thought because the link is not really inside the block but next to it:
- The link is now just before the code block. Unfortunately CSS does not let you select elements before, only after some element so a selector for hover does not match.
- I can put the link after the block and then hover works but the problem is that I can't position the link relative to the top of the block. Its position is relative to the bottom instead.
- If I put the link inside the block, highlighting breaks completely. Apparently the highlighting plugin sees the element inside `<pre>` as a part of the text to be highlighted and decides it does not contain valid Solidity code. It then does not even wrap the block in a `.highlight-solidity` div.

I think we'll have to go with placing it on the side.

    - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11415#issuecomment-931420156

and for some changes from my side:
1. I need to fiddle with CSS a bit more and try to move the icon to the side.
2. I need to move the icon attribution to a new page in the docs (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11697#pullrequestreview-759551804).

Hopefully this is now ready:
- Icon is now to the side, with text appearing only on hover.
- Added a "Credits and attribution" page with a link in the footer.
- I have increased the URL length limit to 8000 because I think this is the best compromise.

Well, looks like 8000 is no longer enough. We do have one Yul snippet longer than that (9577 byte-long URL). It's the ERC20 implementation example from `yul.rst`.

What do we do about it? I'd be inclined to increase the safe length even more (to 10k) because I don't think it's really such a big issue - at worst user can just copy and paste it manually.

A more robust solution would be to have each of these longer snippets served as a separate file and use [`literalinclude`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-literalinclude) directive to also keep it on the page as it is now. Then we could give Remix the URL as suggesed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11415#issuecomment-931424265. This requires changes in the extension to be able to handle such blocks specially and maybe some extra changes to ensure these literalincludes are actually served as separate files. I'm not sure it's really worth the effort. If we want this, I'd prefer to get this PR finally merged and work on it separately as an additional feature.

Yeah, it's because of the link length limit (it's a warning and we have "treat warnings as errors enabled").
