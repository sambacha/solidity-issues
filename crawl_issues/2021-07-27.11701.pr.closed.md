If we are fine with the rules, can someone update the conversion documentation of integer and bytesNN types accordingly, please?

Actually now I think explicit conversion between all fixed point types should be possible, if it is also possible to integer types. What does everyone else think?

I would add: implicit conversion from rational number expressions to fixed point types are only possible if there is no precision loss. This means that `0.01` can be implicitly converted to `fixed64x2` but not to `fixed64x1`. For expressions like `1/3` which do not fit finite precision always have to be explicitly converted to a fixed point number that then specifies the desired precision: `fixed64x4(1/3)`.

@hrkrshnn can you take another look?

@leonardoalt About fixed point types, the current plan is to avoid proper type (how it's done here). Instead, using user defined value types to create fixed point libraries. So right now we don't need these PRs. I'll convert them into draft for now.
