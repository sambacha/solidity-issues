I think this is now in the state I would like to have it. One could think about whether integer types should be treated exactly the same as fixed point types with `0` fractional digits.

I hope this should be "green" now. The PR is still missing additional tests.

I would like to keep this unmerged until the code generation for this feature (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11704) is also complete, but please feel to fully review.

@hrkrshnn this version of the PR allows conversion from signed fixed point types to `bytesNN`. I don't really see why we would disallow conversion from signed fixed point. I'm not sure why we disallowed conversion from signed integers to bytes, to be honest.

If at some point we revert if the value does not fit the type on conversion, `uint(int(-1))` should revert, but `bytes32(int(-1))` should not, so I actually think the only condition should be that the number of bytes are the same.
