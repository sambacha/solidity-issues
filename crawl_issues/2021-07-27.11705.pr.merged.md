Ref https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11597

This PR:
- Groups together all unproved targets in a single message by default: `X verification targets could not be proved. Use option \"show unproved\" to see all of them`
- Adds JSON and CLI option to use the option mentioned above
- The new code first collects unsafe and unproved target messages to print them afterwards. This has 3 consequences besides the main goal of the PR:
  - `Conflict` and `Error` SMT results are showed first, before unsafe and unproved messages.
  - Unsafe and unproved messages are properly sorted by AST id now.
  - Removes duplication of unproved messages. Sometimes, several queries are created for the same target, for example when external calls are present, to cover all possible entry points of the contract. If many of these queries are unproved, several identical messages are created. Also, if several are unproved and one is proved, the unproved messages are still reported. The new code removes all that duplication.

The error code that the failed test complained about is actually present in the command line tests.
