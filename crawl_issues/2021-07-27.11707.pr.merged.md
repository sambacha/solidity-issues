# [\#11707 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11707) `merged`: [Docs] Clarify optional parts in remappings

Replaces #11685.

Turns out the implementation is fine but the docs are wrong after my recent rewrite. This PR clarifies what exactly is optional.

I only mention `target` and not `=target`. A remapping without the latter can still be seen as a remapping but I think it's clearer to have the user think about it only as an input file. They're not even equivalent in all cases. For example `solc c.sol a/=/a` does not work the same way as `solc c.sol a/` - the latter will produce an error.
