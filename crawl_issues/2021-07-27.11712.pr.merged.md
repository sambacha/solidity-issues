# [\#11712 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11712) `merged`: Running only selected command-line tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-27 23:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11712):

A simple modification that makes `cmdlineTests.sh` run tests only from the directories that match positional arguments.

For example this command:
```bash
test/cmdlineTests.sh --update *standard* stdin/ too_long_line*/
```
will run only tests from:
- `test/cmdlineTests/*standard*/`
- `test/cmdlineTests/stdin/`
- `test/cmdlineTests/stdin/too_long_line*/`

By default - if no pattern is specified - it runs all tests.

Note that when the script is not executed from inside `test/cmdlineTests/` and a pattern matches some files in the current dir, it needs to be quoted.  For example running `test/cmdlineTests.sh *` from repo root will try to use `Changelog.md` as the test name so you have to use `test/cmdlineTests.sh "*"` instead.
