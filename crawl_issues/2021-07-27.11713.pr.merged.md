# [\#11713 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11713) `merged`: Better error message when base path does not exist

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-07-27 23:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11713):

A small tweak to #11518. When the directory specified as base path does not exist, the message says it's not a directory which is confusing. It's better to have a separate error message when it does not exist.
