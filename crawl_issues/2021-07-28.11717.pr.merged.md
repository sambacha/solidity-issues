# [\#11717 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11717) `merged`: Handle --optimize-runs option in assembly mode

Fixes #11708.

My first PR here! (thanks to the "good first issue" label) A few things to note:
* ~~Four checks of the `CommandLineParserTest/assembly_mode_options` test are not passing, down from 16 after changing the test to expect 1000 expected runs in assembly mode. I could use some help figuring out why these last four checks are failing.~~ Fixed!
* ~~I couldn't easily find how to build the docs in the Solidity documentation, so my docs changes are untested.~~ Just found the Makefile in the docs folder.

I've located the test that fails. It's at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/36ea509ef59e65d6e81633a9aafacef60fc627c0/test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp#L421

The test fails because a check fails for expectedExecutionsPerDeployment: 200 == 0. I'm not quite sure why this happens, probably something to do with default values.

Thanks for doing this so quickly! Sorry for the many comments, but it looks much better than the comments might indicate :)
