# [\#11719 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11719) `closed`: Tracking unimplemented fixed point features

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13174375?u=52d702cb6bec53b561afa293cf9cd53ef7a63924&v=4" width="50">[hrkrshnn](https://github.com/hrkrshnn) opened issue at [2021-07-29 13:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11719):

- [ ] `type(ufixedMxN).min` and `.max`
- [ ] Error when `ufixedMxN` where `N` is too large to fit into `M` (e.g., `ufixed8x80` is currently allowed.) Controversial: don't implement.
- [x] Check that comparing two rational numbers for equality does not apply rounding before comparison.
- [x] Check that the abi decoder reverts if the input value is out of range for the type (part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11704)
- [x] check that storing and loading from storage works properly (especially truncating sign bits)
- [x] check that getters work properly
- [x] check that rounding is towards zero for precision loss and conversion to integer (also for negative values)
- [x] comparison operators (codegen + tests)
- [x] abi json (fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11825 )

Also https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/409 has some. A fresh issue to track things that come up in PRs.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I guess this is still relevant until we decide to officially deprecate fixed-point types.

This isn't relevant anymore. If we don't have it, we should instead have an issue for deprecating and removing the existing fixed-point types.
