# [\#11730 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11730) `merged`: [CLI] Deduplicate optimizer initialization

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-03 15:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11730):

Related to #11720.
Also implements part of #11629.

There were multiple places that initialized `OptimiserSettings`: it's needed for validation in `CommandLineParser` and later in `CommandLineInterface` to actually initialize the compiler. In both cases the initialization was performed separately for the compiler and for the assembler. Now there's a single function that creates the struct based on `CommandLineOptions`.

This change would result in optimizer settings being parsed (but unused) in linker mode so I also made the compiler reject them in this mode and also in Standard JSON mode.

But we won't be throwing out `CommandLineParser` completely, will we? It's completely CLI-specific and half of this change touches the code there. The other half deals with converting optimizer options to `OptimiserSettings` - that part would be gone but instead we'd have to convert them to Standard JSON input. So this refactor would make sense even after such a rewrite.

Also, I went though `CommandLineInterface` to see how much would be rewritten and a lot of it deals with formatting the CLI output. Input parsing was also a large part of it but that's now in `CommandLineParser`. The part that would actually have to be rewritten on top of Standard JSON is in just 3 functions: [`compile()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L573-L705), [`handleAst()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L797-L827) and [`assemble()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L942-L1088). That's ~250 lines out of more than 1000 (+ another 1000 in `CommandLineParser`). I think that extracting output formatting into a separate component, like I did with `CommandLineParser` would actually make more sense. Then we could rewrite or improve each part separately instead of having a monster task to rewrite everything.

Well ok, fair enough - you may be right that that may in fact be the best way to achieve the same thing.
