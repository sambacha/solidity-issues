In load resolver, we currently only do this if the value at memory location `k` is known. 

Example: 

```
contract C {
    event E(string indexed);
    function f() external {
        emit E("");
    }
}
```

```
                    let _1 := 0
                    if eq(0x26121ff0, shr(224, calldataload(_1)))
                    {
                        if callvalue() { revert(_1, _1) }
                        if slt(add(calldatasize(), not(3)), _1) { revert(_1, _1) }
                        log2(128, _1, 0x3e9992c940c54ea252d3a34557cc3d3014281525c43d694f89d5f3dfd820b07d, keccak256(128, _1))
                        return(128, _1)
                    }
```

Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to implement as a simplifcation rule. We'll need to check if the optimization is worth it using `--optimize-runs`, similar to how it's implemented in LoadResolver.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
