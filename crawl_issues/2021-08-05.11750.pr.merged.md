Currently we have one test failure. I don't know much about the backend part of immutables and am wondering if this is just a matter of changing asserts or if the actual logic needs changes.

I mainly changed the order in which we process the flow so that we first process the parts that will provide the value (right hand side of assignment or var declarations and inheritance specifiers) and only then the actual assignment.

Please be careful, I'm not sure if this simple approach works, although it very well might. Please take the following edge cases into account:
 - the same function called multiple times, once before the immutable is initialized, once after
 - the exact order in which base constructors are executed and state variables are initialized - this is also different depending on IR / non-IR mode. To be sure, maybe disallow reading immutables in situations that do not work in both cases.

My changes current disallow this already because one immutable can't read another one when initialized inline and as far as I can tell after some reading & tests that is pretty much the only way we can cause a difference in the order..

Are you sure? Is this true, also with inheritance and e.g. state variable initializers calling virtual functions?

Also why is it impossible to initialize one immutable through another one? Wouldn't that be a nice use-case?

I'll probably have time to check your PR tomorrow.

Yes, I am pretty sure. The reason is that the validator is first evaluating the right-hand-side of each immutable state variable declaration and only in the next loop it actually marks the ones that had a value as initialized.

> [..] Wouldn't that be a nice use-case?

That could be nice indeed and I think I could make it possible to do that, but I can't tell just yet how much the difference in behavior of the backends would interfere or complicate this particular feature

Please add a tets with an external funciton type as immutable - it has two stack slots and maybe fails in the old code generator.

This test does not work with the IR (it reads the immutable before it has been initialized):
```
abstract contract A {
	uint public t;
	constructor() { t = f(); }

	function f() virtual view internal returns (uint);
}
contract B is A {
	uint immutable x = 2;
	function f() override view internal returns (uint) { return x; }
}
```
The reason is that when compiling via IR, state variables are only initialized right before the constructor of that contract is executed (in old codegen, the are all initialized first).

To fix this, I think we have to mark the state variables as initialized as late as possible (but visit their values as early as possible, as we already do now). I think the fix is to move the
```
for (VariableDeclaration const* stateVar: contract->stateVariables())
	m_initializedStateVariables.emplace(stateVar);
```
loop into the loop that also visits the constructors.

Please update documentation and add a test:

  uint x = f();
  function f() internal pure returns (uint) { return t; }

More test ideas:
```
contract C { constructor(uint) {} }
contract D is C(D.t = 2) {
  uint immutable t;
}
```

```
contract C { constructor(uint) {} }
contract D is C {
  uint immutable t;
  constructor() C(t=2) {}
}
```

```
contract D {
  uint immutable t;
  modifier m(uint) { _; }
  constructor() m(t=2) {}

}
```

Hmm all except the last of your tests have immutable-unrelated errors (identifier not found => t)

In that case, can you replace the `t=2` by a call to a function?

Looks very good already!
I think the following things should still be done:

- [ ] make `read && write` a separate case in the analysis
- [ ] update documentation
- [ ] add a test case that shows that `a = 1; b = a; c = d; d = b;` is possible in the constructor where all these variables are immutables.

be possible? d is read before it is assigned..

sorry: `a = 1; b = a; c = b; d = c;`
