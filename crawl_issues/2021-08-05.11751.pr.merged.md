# [\#11751 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11751) `merged`: Fix inconsistent suppressing of pre-release warning + remove superfluous warnings from tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-05 15:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11751):

`cmdlineTests.sh` has special logic that suppresses the warning about pre-release compiler version in order to get consistent test results on both release and non-release version. This has broken when we made the compiler print an extra message when there is no output. This PR strips that extra message.

This was preventing us from consistently using SPDX comments and version pragmas in these tests to get less warnings. This PR cleans that up too.

It also removes superfluous `exit` files. They are not needed when the exit code is zero.

I think that this message about the output being empty was only added recently. The person adding it probably did not think it would break this. I probably would not think of it either unless I saw tests failing in CI :)

Oh, it's not as recent as I thought: #4958. Version 0.5.1. In that case it must have been broken all along. But this is an edge case that only happens when you have completely empty sterr and stdout and there are very few tests that have no output at all. Looking at the warnings I removed here, the tests that do probably were using these warnings to work around this problem just as you did :)
