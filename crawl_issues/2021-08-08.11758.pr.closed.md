I generalized the case statement in install_deps.sh for Big Sur. Any version of the format 11.X will now work.

Closed because this is failing the build tests...worked locally, not sure why it didn't work in the CI

What was the error? I suspect it must have been just a warning from shellcheck because we do not actually run this script as a part of CI.

No, looks like shellcheck passed just fine. It looks like something unrelated to your PR. [The Windows build job](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/17797/workflows/0a1c6a2b-8afe-4e41-b791-a16367fae70f/jobs/796112) is apparently failing because it's having a problem downloading Boost 1.74 source (not sure why - probably a temporary upstream problem?). The [macOS build](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/17797/workflows/0a1c6a2b-8afe-4e41-b791-a16367fae70f/jobs/796123) has a weird error mentioning signal 10 (SIGBUS?) but I think it's CircleCI trying to stop it because the PR has been closed.

Not sure what the exact problem with Boost is but it's definitely not caused by your PR. We'll sort that out on Monday (maybe it will even just resolve itself in the meantime anyway as a lot of these weird CI problems do).

You can reopen your PR, I think it's fine.
