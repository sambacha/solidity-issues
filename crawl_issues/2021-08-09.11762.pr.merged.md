This seems to be stalled. Pinging @s0sharma. Would it be possible for you to make the changes from the review comments? Thanks for the PR.

sorry for the delay. I'm busy right now. It may take a couple of days to work on it.

@s0sharma I can take over if you don't have time to finish this. We have a ton of pending PRs right now and we'd like trim that number down a bit :)

 #12106 should fix the failing `b_osx`. I'd rebase the PR on it but github will probably close it once the base PR is merged since it's an external PR so I'll just wait for that base PR to be merged instead.
