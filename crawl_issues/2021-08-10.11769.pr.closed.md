I'm currently re-working the entire Resources section in the docs but I'll make sure to keep Solidity-by-example included in it!

@v-sreekesh I just realized that Solidity by Example is not updated to v0.8.x yet. Is this planned? I prefer to only have up-to-date resources in this section.

I don't think there is a new version, sorry for the confusion. I thought you were the maintainer of this or somehow involved in it. @v-sreekesh 

I think this PR can be closed because it's included in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11775.
