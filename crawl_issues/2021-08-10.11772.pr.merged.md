Generally looks good. I'll take another look after the rest of the examples are changed. It would be nice to squash the commits into a single one before we can merge it. But I can also do it at the end, if you aren't familiar with this.

Please make sure that the explanation before and after the code is still OK with the code.

@v-sreekesh Thanks for the PR! The CI seems to be broken now. Will merge once it gets fixed.

It's only the windows build that is failing. Will force-merge this.
