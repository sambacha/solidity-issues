## Changes Done

Updates the resources section of the docs:
- Deletes all outdated tools and 404 links
- Adds missing IDEs and tools
- Adds some new relevant links to the "general" section

## Remaining Issue

For some reason, the formatting looks different now. 

It used to show the IDEs like this:

while now for me locally it looks like this:

I don't know why. Can anybody help me?

Looks like that's an intentional change in newer versions of the RTD theme: https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/979#issuecomment-663231386. Apparently that look was inconsistent with other stuff. Weird, I thought it looked nice. We could bring it back with a bit of custom CSS (https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/979#issuecomment-662288540).

BTW, It must have changed after I updated `sphinx-rtd-theme` in #11659 but the weird thing that I don't see the old style in rendered docs at docs.soliditylang.org, even for very old versions like 0.5.0. I thought those never get updated/rebuilt.

Ok I just thought I did something wrong. I'm fine with keeping it in the new style.
