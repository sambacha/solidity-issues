# [\#11777 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11777) `merged`: [DOCS] Improving the naming consistency in Solidity by Example documentation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5157350?u=3de8e717a2d1894f97068d33ac31e52a9ce79793&v=4" width="50">[Ahmed-Ali](https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali) opened issue at [2021-08-10 19:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11777):

According to Solidity naming convention: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html#naming-conventions

There is no need to use underscore except when there is a naming collision. In which case, a trailing underscore is used to avoid the collision.
So in this change, I am removing all underscores, except for the ones that could shadow other symbols in their context (none of the changed names is a reserved keyword: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html?highlight=reserved#reserved-keywords )

For ref, this is a follow up PR with reference to issue: #11764

Thanks @hrkrshnn and apologies for not rebasing it earlier; had been pulled in other stuff that kept me away for a bit!
