Thanks for your pull request! Please note that we do not use the Oxford comma and we use British spelling unless there is an alternative that is valid in both American and British English. Furthermore, please try to make the changes in a way that do not introduce or erase line breaks, since that makes it much easier to review your changes.

@marooncoder09 could you please revert the American English words and perhaps the oxford comma as well? The rest of the changes look good, and we can merge it. Thanks.
