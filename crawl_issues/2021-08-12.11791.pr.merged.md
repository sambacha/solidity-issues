# [\#11791 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11791) `merged`: Document pre-0.5.0 bytesX/uintY conversions

Breaking changes sections from 0.6.0, 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 have a subsection titled "How to update your code". Breaking changes from 0.5.0 doesn't have that section. Instead it has an old contract adapted to the new version with some comments. So there are some missing bits.

Since 0.5.0 conversions between ``bytesX`` and ``uintY`` of different size are disallowed for reasons explained in the documentation. But the behavior of pre-0.5.0 is not currently documented, which may be needed to adapt a pre-0.5.0 contract to newer versions when keeping exactly the same contract behavior is a requirement.

This PR documents this pre-0.5.0 behavior. A simple contract can be used to verify the proposed changes.

Calling ```verify()``` will not revert.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.26;

contract Test {
    constructor() public{      
    }

    function verify() public pure {
        require(uint8(bytes3(0x291807)) == uint8(uint24(bytes3(0x291807))));
        require(uint16(bytes3(0x291807)) == uint16(uint24(bytes3(0x291807))));
        require(uint32(bytes3(0x291807)) == uint32(uint24(bytes3(0x291807))));
        require(uint32(bytes2(0x1234)) == uint32(uint16(bytes2(0x1234))));
        require(bytes1(uint24(0x291807)) == bytes1(uint8(uint24(0x291807))));
        require(bytes2(uint24(0x291807)) == bytes2(uint16(uint24(0x291807))));
        require(bytes4(uint24(0x291807)) == bytes4(uint32(uint24(0x291807))));
    }
}
```

Let me quickly squash the two commits.
