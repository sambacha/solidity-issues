The expression simplifier should stabilize, shouldn't it? Then we could also just run it until it does that...

Thought about that, too, but the simplifier needs to run the splitter again, because if the replacement is not just a single opcode, it cannot use the variable anymore, since it is not in SSA form.

We can of course just run the splitter just before the simplifier whenever it is run and then stabilize.

Hm, we could also support nested brackets in the optimiser suite and change the sequence to include
`[sxu]` (simplifier, splitter, unused pruner) - the suite will run the bracketed expression until it is stable.

Yeah, I know, I meant just running them both until stable.

@cameel what do you think, how much work would it be to allow nested `[...]` sequences inside the optimizer sequences?

@chriseth Not much as long as nothing fancy is needed. The processing is inside a single function that loops over the string so it's just a matter of either giving it a stack or making it recursive.

It is weird that this does not have a real impact. I will undo the changes except for the cases where we already have a repetition.

Yeah, that's really weird. Just to make sure it's not a bug in the code handling the brackets, I locally replaced the brackets with steps manually repeated a few times and ran tests. There were no failures so apparently repeating these steps multiple times really does not affect the final output. At least on the code samples we have in the repo.

Ah, but I'm actually not surprised that the current version has no changes in the test: If running the step one more time would make a difference, it is just that the outer loop is run once again. So adding inner loops was just to have fewer executions overall.
