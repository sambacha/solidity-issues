Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11615.
Prerequesite for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493 (which runs it universally and thereby universally tests it).

The idea here is to primarily validate that whatever https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11615 did made sense and leads to code consistent with the Yul Control Flow Graph.
