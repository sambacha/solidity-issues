Partially Resolves #11731

I did the following:
- Modified the functions that print version and license info in `CommandLineParser` to make them not use `exit()`.
- Replaced all the code that prints to `serr()` and returns `false` with an exception (uses the `BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION` macro)

Doesn't change too much. This is my first commit to this repository. Let me know what you think.

EDIT by cameel:
- ~Depends on #12125.~ Merged.
- ~Depends on #12118.~ Merged.

It's not based on these two PRs to avoid github closing it when they're merged. Instead it contains commits from these PRs. I'll rebase it to remove them when those PRs are merged.

Thanks @cameel. I'm kind of embarrassed to have submitted this now :). I'll try to work on this and get back to you. Thanks for your help!

@spiyer99 Are you working on this? Do you need help?

We have a ton of pending PRs right now and we'd like trim that number down a bit. If you don't have time for it, I can take over and finish it.

This is almost finished. The one remaining thing is to update docstrings in `CommandLineInterface` and `CommandLineParser`.

Also #12125 and #12118 need to be merged first so I'm keeping it as a draft for now.

This is now ready but still waiting for #12118 to be merged.

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12125#issuecomment-942121559 @chriseth said it's ok to slightly change the control flow so that output errors cause an immediate failure (instead of just setting a flag and failing later after the output stage). I added a commit that changes it.

Hey @cameel sorry for the late reply. I actually forgot about this, but good to see that you got this done in my absence ðŸ˜Š.

All dependencies have been merged so this is now reviewable.
