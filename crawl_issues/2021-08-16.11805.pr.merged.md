I have updated https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/542 so that this change is no longer needed.

But now the `npm config set` line is redundant anymore so I'll push here in a moment to remove it. It was a terrible hack anyway, since it modifiers your global npm config in `~/.npmrc`.

"Approved" (again I'm original author, so I can't officially :-))
