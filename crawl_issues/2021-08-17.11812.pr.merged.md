# [\#11812 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11812) `merged`: Add missing header.

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11811.

I wonder if our policy should be to directly include all STL headers required by a class, independently of them being included by other headers already. Otherwise, I see little chance of reviewing against these kinds of things and STL implementations will pull in whatever they like, so CI won't avoid this either.

I thought that *was* our policy :) That's what I usually do. I include everything that contains symbols I explicitly refer to in the file. Though it's hard to keep these includes up to date because the compiler does not complain when a header is already included through another.

Maybe we should try https://include-what-you-use.org and add it to CI if it's reliable? It looked promising for superfluous includes (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10269#issuecomment-869074661) but that wasn't very important. It could help with cases like this, it would be more worthwhile.

At a quick glance, I hardly see it adhered to anywhere :-).
I mean, the file here would additionally need at least ``<map>``, ``<vector>`` and ``<optional>``. But moving to a random next one ``OptimiserStep.h``, it's e.g. missing ``<memory>`` and my guess is it's true for more files than for which it isn't that they're missing *something* relative to that policy.

Does that really work for STL headers at all?

If there is something that works reliably that we can use in CI, then I'm all for doing so, but I'd be surprised :-).

Well, let's find out. I created an issue, very likely that someone will pick that up: #11813.
It's already mentioned in the issue about removing includes, but it's buried under a ton of comments so I think a new, more focused issue will bring more attention to it.
