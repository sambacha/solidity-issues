Fixes #11822 

- Adds 3 nightly runs (UBSan build, UBSan soltest, UBSan CLI test)

Since the UBSan run will be on a nightly basis, we will only start seeing failures such as those in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11822 after this PR is merged.

There seems to be a circle ci config failure after I performed refactoring. I will post an update once I have understood how to pass a parameter correctly to a parameterized build job.

I did not test them unfortunately (can't really without actually running CI) so I might have made a mistake somewhere but that's based on what I did for `t_ems_ext` and the general concept should work with some minimal adjustments.

Sadly, I couldn't figure out a way to parameterize the sanitizer build job while using it as a dependent job for the sanitizer test job. The `t_ems_ext` job is slightly different because it is a standalone job.

Too bad. At last the step refactor makes the config a bit shorter so there's still some reuse :)

I think I have incorporated most review comments by @cameel , waiting for approval/re-review.

Looks like the only thing left to do here is to fix merging of `"steps"` and after that the PR should be good to go into `develop`.
