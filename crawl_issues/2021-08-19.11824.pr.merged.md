# [\#11824 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11824) `merged`: Mark recursive calls in yul control flow graph.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-08-19 11:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11824):

Adds an additional annotation to function call operations in the yul control flow graph: ``recursive``, which is true, iff the call is recursive.

Background: this information will be useful for opting for more aggressive stack compression before any recursive calls, s.t. we are less likely to hit the global 1024 stack slot limit of the EVM during deep recursions.

With this change and opting for aggressive stack compression for recursive calls, the maximal amount of recursions can be reached for the function in the issue.

I would approve this, but it has no tests (understandably) and the new internal feature isn't used yet. I'll give it some time for someone else to complain, and will approve after otherwise.
