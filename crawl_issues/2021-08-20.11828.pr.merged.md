This PR is more easily reviewed by commit.

This PR correlates `address(this).balance` and `msg.sender` properly, following:
- At contract deployment, the address of the contract might have funds already, so we add the constraint `address(this).balance >= msg.value`.
- The balance of the contract might change between transactions because of potentially being used as `selfdestruct` or `coinbase` targets, so at the external entry point of every public function, we add the constraint `address(this).balance' = address(this).balance + msg.value + k` where `k` is an unbounded non-negative value, representing these potential increases that do not trigger calls to the contract.

The second item required a small but nice refactoring in the way that the transaction entry points were encoded.
For each function we have a function summary that represents the summary of the function body. To represent external calls into the contract, we had the rule
`interface && summary_f => interface'`
However, now we need to add more things here, so that we have something like
`interface && update_balance && summary_f => interface'`
and this can get complicated very easily.


What this PR does is:
- Create a new rule to separate these extra things done right before the transaction goes into the function, using a new type of summary "external summary":
```
true => external_f_entry
external_f_entry && update_balance && summary_f => external_summary_f
```
This predicate is then used as a constraint in the interface part:
`interface && external_summary_f => interface'`

It's nice that this is done here because the trusted mode PR also needs to do that.

It is also used by the nondeterministic interface rules instead of the normal summary, because that one is also related only to the external interface.

@hrkrshnn updated review comments and merged the first two commits getting rid of the problem you mentioned.
I still need to add (or remove) some constraints to take care of the transfer case you mentioned.

Rebased and fixed comments.
Will squash when it's approved.

@cameel I wanted to squash anyway, so fixed the variable name in the same push.

Squash a few of the extra commits I meant. The commits list is fine now.
