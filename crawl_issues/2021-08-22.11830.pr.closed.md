@v-sreekesh How is it going with the implementation? Do you need any help?

This is now fully implemented and ready for review.

I did some test cleanup to make the changes the feature introduces easier to see. That's in #12098 and needs to be merged before this PR.

Weird, why was this closed? I just merged the other PR...
I'm not able to re-open this, so created a new PR: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12102

I've had this happen before. Github for some reason closes external PRs based on another branch. Maybe it's because merging the base PR deletes the branch and github can't change base to `develop` because the latest commits from `develop` do not exist in the external repo? In any case this pretty inconvenient on github's part.
