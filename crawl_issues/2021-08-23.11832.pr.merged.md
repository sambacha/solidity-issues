# [\#11832 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11832) `merged`: Fix pylint warnings about encoding in `open()`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-23 18:08](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11832):

Fixes the failing [`chk_pylint` job](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/18273/workflows/9a7347b4-cbbd-4b99-a714-f017e128dd19/jobs/814903) in CI. [Pylint 2.10](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/stable/whatsnew/2.10.html) emitts the `unspecified-encoding` warning if `open()` does not specify encoding and we had quite a few of these.

Note that UTF-8 is not always the default encoding. From [Built-in Functions > open()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open):

> encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever `locale.getpreferredencoding()` returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the `codecs` module for the list of supported encodings.

It should be the default at least in some cases so I think we should be ok just setting it to `'utf8'` though.

> Looks good. Can be merged if CI works.

You can use the auto-merge feature for that ;)

Yeah, I didn't do anything since there seem to be some dependency with the windows PR.

~Closing, since the PR has been merged as a part of #11835.~

Or not. Looks like the merge went into this branch rather than into `develop`. We can merge this one then since it should now pass all the checks.

but now this PR has a Merge commit from the other one. Do we wanna keep that?

I don't think it's a problem. The merge commits used to update a branch are bad because you can potentially get "hidden" changes from conflict resolutions in them. But this one is just an empty merge commit that marks a point where two branches were joined, just like the ones on `develop`. I'd even say that it's a good thing because it shows that here were two branches.

But if you think it's better not to have it, I can submit a new PR.
