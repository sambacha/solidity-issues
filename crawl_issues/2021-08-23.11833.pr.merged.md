~Depends on #11832.~ Merged.

This is an old branch I prepared while working on the bytecode compare script when I discovered that some simple mistakes like unused imports or variables go unnoticed by pylint. I never submitted though because we had a big PR backlog.

Well, we still have a backlog, but having to fix #11832 seems like a good occasion to finally push it through :)

Looks like my import tweaks broke `chk_proofs`. It's because some files import stuff from `z3` indirectly, via `opcodes.py`. Switching to draft now. I'll get back to it when I'm done fixing the other CI problems.

This is finally reviewable. My lazy way of ignoring the warnings in `test/formal` didn't work out and in the end it was simpler to just go other all the files and add explicit imports than to look for another workaround.
