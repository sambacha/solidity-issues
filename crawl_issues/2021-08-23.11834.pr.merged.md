# [\#11834 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11834) `merged`: Improve `pylint_all.sh`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-23 18:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11834):

This PR refactors the `pylint_all.sh` script and fixes a few annoying things about it:
- The script used to run pylint separately on each file, which is **slow**. Now it passes them all in one go.
    - It reverts to the old behavior if you want it to stop on first error (because pylint does not have an option for that).
    - Now pylint can detect `duplicate-code`. Unfortunately we have a lot of duplicated code in `test/formal/`, which is why I had to disable it.
- I enabled pylint's colored output and disabled the score summary. Especially when running on files individually, the summary makes the output hard to read.
- It now uses `subprocess` instead `os.system()`, which means that it actually stops on Ctrl+C. It also no longer prints the huge stack trace if you kill it that way (well, mostly - if you do it at the wrong time, it still prints it but even then it's shorter :)).
- It now uses `argparse` for sane command-line processing.
