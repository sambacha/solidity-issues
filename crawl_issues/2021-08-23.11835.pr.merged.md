# [\#11835 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11835) `merged`: Use empty user agent when downloading Boost from jfrog in powershell

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-23 19:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11835):

This fixes the [`b_win`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/18272/workflows/f6534c77-5660-4de4-af2a-f2f9abc3db43/jobs/814852) and `b_win_release` jobs in CI. They have been failing intermittently for some time and now they seem to be failing in all PRs.

Looks like it's a server-side problem: [[RTFACT-26216] Native browser redirect prevents windows Power Shell (Invoke-WebRequest command) from downloading a file](https://www.jfrog.com/jira/si/jira.issueviews:issue-html/RTFACT-26216/RTFACT-26216.html). One of the workarounds is to use a different user agent. An empty one does the job.

EDIT: I just realized that this and #11832 can't be merged separately because the failing checks in both of them are marked as `required`. I'm putting this PR on top of #11832 to make it mergable. Please review them both and then merge just this one.

But merging this one still requires the other one to be merged

Interestingly, it doesn't :) I got a few cases where my PR that depended on another was merged without merging that other one.

I mean, github might since then have introduced some safeguard for PRs that have a different base branch. But in that case changing it to `develop` would work around that.

An in the wost case I can always just create a new PR, but I wanted to avoid having too many of them.

Wow, it even let me merge it myself :)

Oh, wait it went into the base branch, not into `develop`. So looks like the behavior did change. ~Oh well, I'll create a new PR then.~

Or we can just merge #11832 as @leonardoalt suggested.
