Please I need help with this. I sent 8248 alix to the contract by mistake for avoiding a scam.
I spoke to the devs since the token is the same currency of the contract but they told me they "can't do nothing about it. "
It seems not fair since they could just return the tokens back to me. 

I've researched and there is an option to re-transfer back the tokens to my wallet but only the owners can do this.
Also, as I've seen here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10616 . My tokens are the same as the contract ones!

Please help! the red is BSC
