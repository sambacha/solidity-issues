This fails in `t_ubu_ossfuzz`:
```

```

I think it's the bug reported in #11587.

I wonder why `t_ubu_ossfuzz` is running here though. In the CircleCI config it's set to run nightly and even then only on `develop_060` and `develop`.

@cameel I think for some reason the CI checks are the same as the nightly. All the tests (except t_ubu_ossfuzz) were passing immediately after creating the PR.

Looks like auto-merge does not get triggered due to the `This branch is out-of-date with the base branch` warning. Merging manually.

Wait, I can't even merge manually :)
