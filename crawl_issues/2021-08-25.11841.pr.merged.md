# [\#11841 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11841) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Erase balances when delegatecall is seen

Storage is being erased properly when we see a `delegatecall`, but balances are not. This PR fixes that.
Note that the TODO line added here and some of the tests will change in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11828, when proper support connecting `msg.value` and `balance` will make the internal library/free functions work. The public library functions should remain the same.

Looks like counterexamples are slightly different on macOS though and CI fails.

@hrkrshnn changed code and added tests specifically to BMC (CHC should be correct already)
