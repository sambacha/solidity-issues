The failing CI tests should be fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11840.

Please rebase your PR on `develop`. It has fixes for the failing windows and pylint jobs.

In general it's best to ensure your branch is up to date with `develop` whenever you submit it for review or apply review fixes.

But this should go to breaking. But need to merge https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11840 first.

Ah, you're totally right.

Looks like bringing it up to date with `develop` has revealed some new errors.
1) https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11842#discussion_r696012913
2) `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/inlineAssembly/basefee_berlin_function.sol` needs to be moved to `test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/` and updated because it now results in a compilation error. You can just move it and run `isoltest` with the `--accept-updates` to have the compiler update the expectations in the file for you.

Also, I see that the commits are now nicely squashed but there's still a bit of unnecessary stuff there: you can remove the empty merge commit from the branch (it does not add anything useful) and clean up the description of the remaining commit (it has some junk left over after squashing).

I have just updated tests and rebased changes on the newest breaking branch. The review can be resumed.
