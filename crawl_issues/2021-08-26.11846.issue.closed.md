This came up in #11823.

Our [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml) file is pretty long. I went through the file and here's a bunch of changes that we could do to improve it.

Deduplication:
- [x] `t_archlinux_soltest`, `t_ubu_soltest_enforce_yul`, `t_ubu_ubsan_clang` and `t_ubu_ubsan_clang_cli` could use `run_soltest_steps`.
    - Note that `run_soltest_steps` cannot be added to an existing list of steps but it you could probably embed inside a step by using a [`when` parameter of a `run` step](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run).
- Some jobs look very similar. Perhaps they could be replaced by a single job with parameters (see `t_ems_ext` job for an example; also [Reusable Config Reference Guide](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/)). If not, it might at least be possible to extract reusable steps from them:
    - [ ] `b_ubu_clang`, `b_ubu_asan_clang` and `b_ubu_ubsan_clang`.
    - [ ] `t_osx_soltest` and `t_osx_cli`.
    - [ ] `b_bytecode_ubu`, `b_bytecode_osx` and `b_bytecode_win`. 
- [x] Many jobs set the `TERM` variable to `xterm`. I think it would not hurt to just have it set once, globally, so that we do not have to worry about it.
    - EDIT: This probably does not have a good solution (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11868#discussion_r699430288) but I'm leaving it open. Maybe someone will figure out something.
    - EDIT2: I found a good compromise in #12173 - now the variable is defined in the `base_` templates.
- [ ] Jobs that differ only by one or two steps could be simplified by [passing these steps as arguments](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#steps).

Refactors:
- [x] All the `test_` templates (e.g. `test_ubuntu1604_clang` or `t_ubu_soltest`) seem a bit pointless because their steps are almost always overwritten. And when they're not, they're misleading because it's not apparent which steps they run just from their name. For example `test_ubuntu2004` runs `soltest_all` while `test_ubuntu2004_clang` runs only `soltest`. And after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11823#discussion_r692403300 it's easy to explicitly specify their steps directly in the job anyway. I think that a better system would be to convert these templates into base dicts that just set the base docker image (maybe also `parallelism` and resource class). I'd remove steps from them (move them to jobs). I'd use `image_` or `base_` prefix instead of `test_` and rename the section. EDIT: Done in #12173.
- [ ] Our `steps_` templates should be rewritten as [reusable commands](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/reusing-config/#authoring-reusable-commands). This would make their use less verbose because we would no longer need to use the `when` hack I described above to merge them with existing step lists.
    - [ ] Check if steps of some existing jobs could also be converted into commands. One candidate would be for example package installation with `apt-get`. Another might be the stuff we do in bytecode comparison.


Cleanup:
- [x] I think we do not need to run the nightly workflow on the `develop_060` branch. Do we even still have that branch? We're already at 0.8.x.
- [x] There are some dicts like `run_soltest_all_steps` that actually contain `steps:` key rather than `run:`. They should be renamed to start with `steps_`. E.g. `steps_soltest_all`
- [x] All the `run_` steps should be moved to the `Build Templates` section.
- [x] `b_ubu_asan` should be moved next to `b_ubu_asan_clang`.

Great! Which one you'd like to try? I think it would be best to do it step by step, with small focused PRs, instead of creating a big one fixing it all in one go. I expect this will require some trial and error and a full CI run takes about 1h.

While working on CI tasks today I realized that it's possible to pass step lists as parameters and that step lists can be wrapped into reusable commands. This could be used to further simplify the configuration. I added new items to the list in the description.

@cameel thanks for your suggestion, after reading through the code, 
it seem b_bytecode_ubu, b_bytecode_osx can be reused with some common steps.


I have created a pull request here

[12923](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12923)

Can you help to take a look? 

Thanks you!

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
