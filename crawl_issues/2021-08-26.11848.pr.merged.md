Implements the `solc` part of #11409.
`solc-js` part is in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/544.
Depends on #11688. ~In draft mode until that PR is merged.~

Description says this, yet it was merged? :)

Yeah :) It got merged into the base branch rather than into `develop`.
That's why I had to create #12007.
