# [\#11850 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11850) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Remove redundant unsupported warnings

Ref https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11597

The SMTChecker generates a lot of redundant "unsupported" warnings, because it visits every contract separately in its own context, with 2 different engines. So for example if a contract that is inherited by 2 contracts has some assembly in it, we're going to see the message "inline assembly unsupported" possibly 6 times: each time a contract is visited, by each engine.
This PR removes all the redundant messages.

In the no solver case (2), for example when only using the smtlib2 solver, it's now fine to also report the unproved stuff, because there will be only one message bundling all the unproved targets anyway, and all targets will be unproved.

@cameel updated last comments + added `description` back into the `map` but not as key, simply to assert that equal keys must have equal descriptions as suggested.
