# [\#11851 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11851) `merged`: [CI] Bump OpenJDK version from 14 to 16

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-27 10:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11851):

`chk_antlr_grammar` is failing in #11850 because apparently OpenJDK 14 has been removed from Ubuntu Focal repos. Only OpenJDK 8, 13 and 16 are available.

This PR bumps version to 16.
