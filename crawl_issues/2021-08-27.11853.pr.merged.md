@cameel Will this PR be automatically merged? Or is anything pending?

The CI is still running. I enabled auto-merge now so it will be merged once CI passes. We only really enable that if the PR is fairly straightforward or already reviewed and accepted by multiple people - with more complicated ones it's better to have more eyes on the code.

Actually, I see that there's now a new merge commit there. You don't need it. Could you squash it? We update branches by rebasing them instead and merge commits are just unnecessary noise.

@cameel Somehow I'm not able to do a `rebase -i` on this last commit. It is not showing in the list so I'm not able to squash it. Could something be done from your end?

I think it might be because you merged `develop` from `ethereum/solidity` into `develop` in your fork.  You need to remove that last commit from your own `develop`. I.e.
```bash
git checkout d1a79214d5abde9dca926cbb6c1740149c5d4eb0
git checkout -B develop
```
d1a79214d5abde9dca926cbb6c1740149c5d4eb0 is where our `develop` currently is.

I would generally recommend to use feature branches in your fork. It would prevent situations like this because then your `develop` always matches ours and a merge is always a fast-forward one.
