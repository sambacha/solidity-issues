# [\#11854 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11854) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix false negative after `push` on storage references

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11027
Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11852

We need to erase knowledge about storage references when we push an array, because of aliasing.
This was already done when pushing variables directly, but wasn't done when the lvalue is a function return.

It's easier to review this PR with ` Hide whitespace changes ` set.
