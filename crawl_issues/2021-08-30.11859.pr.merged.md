# [\#11859 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11859) `merged`: Revert making `error` a keyword

Fixes #11743.

Just a direct revert of the original commit in #11218. I kept some minor changes like adding the doc page about breaking changes or changing a `catch` variable name from `error` to `_error` in a test unrelated to errors.

`chk_antlr_grammar` is failing because #11851 is only on `develop`. We need to merge `develop` into breaking again.

Rebased after having merged develop into breaking.
