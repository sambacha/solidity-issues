# [\#11867 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11867) `merged`: Solidity snippets next to source locations in IR

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-08-31 13:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11867):

Depends on #11913.

First part of #11858. No options to control this behavior yet - for now the snippets are always included.

TODO:
- [x] Make sure snippets are present in all kinds of IR output. For now I checked only `--ir` and `--ir-optimized` flags.
- [x]
    > Please check that the AsmParser correctly parses the `@src` comment under all circumstances, even if the original source code contains a string `"something @src something"`.

Looks like my change produces invalid IR on Windows - `...` gets dropped to the next line. I think must be because of `\r\n` line endings (the function that prepares snippets looks for `\n` only).

The fact that we have to drag the source provider all the way down is really not nice, but I currently don't see a better way either, but I did not take a close look yet. It gets even more complicated once we add the option about how to format the source references.

It uses this regex on the result of `currentCommentLiteral()` so it looks like it will catch `@src` in the middle of some text as long as it's followed by at least one space:
```c++
static regex const lineRE = std::regex(
	R"~~~((^|\s*)@src\s+(-1|\d+):(-1|\d+):(-1|\d+)(\s+|$))~~~",
	std::regex_constants::ECMAScript | std::regex_constants::optimize
);
```

Also, nested comments will likely be a problem too.

This means that snippets will have to be escaped or sanitized in some way.

I'm looking for a way to test it though. I tried feeding the output of `--ir-optimized` into `--strict-assembly` but looks like that does not show snippets in the assembly (even on `develop` so it's not because my changes broke it :)).

Snippet escaping done. Now `@src` parsing will ignore properly escaped snippets next to the tag so that tags inside them will not affect locations.

I dealt with `*/` inside snippets by replacing `/` with `\/`, but only in that particular sequence. Other `/` are not escaped to reduce noise.

This is now ready for another review.

Rebased on `develop` to resolve conflicts with other PRs that got merged in the meantime.

Looks like it was not actually rebased. Only base in the PR was changed.

This PR now depends on #11913.

Test seems to be failing :(

Yeah, I rebased it on top of #11913 today but looks like I need to fix one of the tests that's no longer valid due to changes in that lower PR.

Tests should be fixed now.
