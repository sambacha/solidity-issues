# [\#11868 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11868) `closed`: CleanUp/Deduplication in .circleci/config.yml

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75240973?u=9885b74640791bb167ee44727e8ad75f52321e6c&v=4" width="50">[yatharthagoenka](https://github.com/yatharthagoenka) opened issue at [2021-08-31 13:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11868):

Implements part of  #11846.

Cleanup
- Dicts containing steps: key have been renamed to start with `steps_` instead of `run_`
- All of `run_` steps have been moved to `Build Templates`
- `b_ubu_asan` has been moved next to `b_ubu_asan_clang` (Line 455)
- Branch `develop_060` doesn't exist at the moment. 

Deduplication
- The `xterm` variable in job environment has been declared globally in pipeline parameters (Line 26) as `environment-term`.

Following your suggestion, I intend on breaking down the tasks into smaller PRs, this being the first one if the changes seem appropriate. Let me know about any changes needed in the current commit.

Even more reason to remove it from the nightly run :) I think it stopped being relevant after 0.6.0 and just no one remembered to get rid of it from the config.

```
# Unable to parse YAML
# found undefined alias b_ubu
#  in 'string', line 456, column 9:
#         <<: *b_ubu
#             ^
```
So this explains why `b_ubu_asan` was not placed next to the other sanitizer jobs. In that case let's move those other jobs so that they are declared after `b_ubu`.

Noted! I'll make the necessary changes in the next commit, and then we could continue with the rest of the tasks.

### Cleanup
- `b_ubu_asan`, `b_ubu_clang`, `b_ubu_asan_clang`, `b_ubu_ubsan_clang` have been moved after `b_ubu` . (Line 454)
- Removed the nightly workflow on the `develop_060` branch, pursuant to its deletion/irrelevance

### Deduplication
- `xterm` variable has been restored to its original state

To work around the CI limitations, I have created a separate PR: #11880. I see that you can still run some CI jobs so please continue working on it here. When you're done I'll pull changes into my PR so that it can complete the whole run.

### Deduplication
> `run_soltest_steps` was renamed to `steps_soltest` #11868.
- `steps_soltest` was incorporated into `t_archlinux_soltest` using the when parameter of run, setting the condition to true.
- The same was directly references into `t_ubu_soltest_enforce_yul` as it had the same set of steps.
- `t_ubu_ubsan_clang` and `t_ubu_ubsan_clang_cli` had a differing set of steps as `steps_soltest`, thus I'm not sure if we could refer to them in this regard, as it would disrupt the original flow of commands

The only difference is `- run: *gitter_notify_failure`, which can be safely moved to the end of the list of steps. It's just a notification posted to the gitter channel if the job fails.

By the way, this set of changes looks fine overall. After you do `t_ubu_ubsan_clang` and `t_ubu_ubsan_clang_cli` I'll pull your changes into #11880 and merge them if the CI passes. For other subtasks from #11846 please start a new PR.

Sure, Noted!
I've completed the said tasks in the last commit (28d0a50).
> `t_ubu_ubsan_clang_cli ` had another differing step i.e. `- run: *run_cmdline_tests`, which was also moved after the `steps_soltest`

Might have confused it with another test. Thank you for pointing it out.
- .`steps_cmdline_tests` have been incorporated into `t_ubu_ubsan_clang_cli`

Ok, this looks good now. Could you squash commits with review fixes?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75240973?u=9885b74640791bb167ee44727e8ad75f52321e6c&v=4" width="50">[yatharthagoenka](https://github.com/yatharthagoenka) commented at [2021-09-03 10:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11868#issuecomment-912447153):

Commits were squashed into c0dd58d. 

Should I open up a new PR for the remaining changes, or do we still have work to do in this one?

I'll need someone to review and approve #11880 so there's a small chance that some problem will be spotted and minor changes will be needed but other than that I think we're finished here.

Please open new PRs for the remaining changes.

Sure, Noted! 

A new PR #11896 has been opened to work on the remaining tasks, while this gets reviewed.
