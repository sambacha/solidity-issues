yeah I wanted to point out the most important one. I'll change it.

@soroosh-sdi Have you managed to find a way to require Z3 4.8.12 just for soltest?

I worked on it but I got lost. I couldn't solve the following obstacles:
 - why does somebody keep two versions of libz3-dev? It is not supported by package managers like apt.
 - soltest and solc have common dependencies like smtutil and if I wanted to use different z3 version I should define someting like this:
  target_link_libraries(smtutil-oldz3 PUBLIC z3::libz3-old) 
  target_link_libraries(smtutil-latestz3 PUBLIC z3::libz3-latest)
I don't know it's possible in cmake or not, even if we can I think it's over-complication for such a temporary issue. ( I assume we finally stop supporting old versions )
- command-line tests directly execute solc and some tests will fail.

No, it's not like that. We don't want to support building with multiple versions. It's just that older versions are acceptable for `solc` but not `soltest` and for such versions you should be able to build just `solc` successfully but building `soltest` should error out.

> command-line tests directly execute solc and some tests will fail.

That's fine. Someone building with older Z3 will be expected to use the `--no-smt` flag when running command-line tests. Just like you are expected to use it now with `soltest` if you don't have the latest Z3.

I guess we can do that:
```
set(LATEST_Z3_VERSION "4.8.12")
if (TESTS AND NOT EMSCRIPTEN)
  find_package(Z3 ${LATEST_Z3_VERSION} REQUIRED)
  if (NOT ${Z3_FOUND})
    message(WARNING "SMTChecker tests require Z3 ${LATEST_Z3_VERSION} for all tests to pass.\
                   \nuse -DTESTS=OFF, if you want to use older version of z3")
  endif()
else()
  find_package(Z3 4.8.0)
endif()
```
 
It worked fine, even when I called it like this: `cmake ../ -DTESTS=ON -DUSE_Z3=OFF`
I didn't expect that :)

yeah, sure.
Do you want me to remove `--no-smt` from those scripts too? I guess it could be helpful if somebody doesn't want to test SMT.

The option is useful so let's keep it. It's still needed if you choose to build without Z3 and then run command line tests.

@soroosh-sdi https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11873#discussion_r705542022 seems to be the last remaining thing to resolve so after you do this, please squash your commits and rebase on `develop`.

Also, this needs rebase on latest `develop` because it's currently on top of my branch with a pylint fix (which has already been merged) and those changes show up in the diff.

Thanks, 
I squashed all commit and rebased it on the latest version of develop.

Actually, there's one more thing. We have version requirements documented in [Building from Source > Prerequisites - All Operating Systems](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#prerequisites-all-operating-systems). This needs to be modified to say that without `STRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF` the compiler will expect the latest version (but do not mention that it's specifically 4.8.12 right now).

I change the table as follow:
```
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| `z3`_ (latest version, Optional)  | For use with SMT checker.                             |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
```
and I can add a note like this:
```
.. note::
    The latest version of Z3 is required to pass all tests, if you don't want to run tests you can
    relax this requirement by calling cmake with `-DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF` and use Z3 version 4.8+.
```

> `z3`_ (latest version, Optional)

The minimum requirement is still 4.8.0 so I'd leave the table unchanged. Instead I'd add only the note:

```rst
.. note::
    The default build configuration requires a specific Z3 version (the latest one at the time the code was last updated).
    Changes introduced between Z3 releases often result in slightly different (but still valid) results being returned.
    Our SMT tests do not account for these differences and will likely fail with a different version than the one they were written for.
    This does not mean that a build using a different version is faulty.
    If you pass ``-DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF`` option to CMake, you can build with any version that satisfies the requirement given in the table above.
    If you do this, however, please remember to pass the ``--no-smt`` option to ``scripts/tests.sh`` to skip the SMT tests.
```

it's 200% better than my version, thank you.
