# [\#11874 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11874) `merged`: Fix UBSan CI

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2021-09-01 10:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11874):

CMake: Remove unsigned-integer-overflow check from UBSan compiler flags because it is too noisy.

This should fix the UBSan CLI failing run that is currently (incorrectly) failing due to noisy prints originating from the check disabled by this PR.

The C++ standard does not officially consider unsigned integer overflows to be undefined behavior since it is implementation independent.

> I'd title the commit something like "Fix UBSan CI" or so (I think commit titles should describe the motivation, not the content). But I won't insist on this.

Done!
