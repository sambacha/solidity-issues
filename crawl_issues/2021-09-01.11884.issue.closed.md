# [\#11884 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11884) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Support abi.decode completely

For
```solidity
require(abi.decode(returndata, (bool)), "SafeERC20: ERC20 operation did not succeed");
```
the SMTChecker reports `Warning: Assertion checker does not yet implement type type(bool)`.

Yea we shouldn't report these here. This actually *is* supported as an uninterpreted function, so we shouldn't report this warning on expressions of type type inside abi calls.
