Looks like some extracted tests need to have their messages updated.

Not only messages, there's a problem I'm not sure how to solve.
`test/SyntaxTest.cpp` assumes the only errors with `location->start == 0` are the SPDX and pragma warnings. But since these changes that this PR does report warnings on `_source.location()`, it goes through the same conditions as the ones above and the things go wrong from there. Still need to figure out what to do there.

Maybe there's code that filters it out and assumes that the message contains no location info?

@cameel https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SyntaxTest.cpp#L132
This is the code I'm talking about. Not sure if that's what you meant, but yea it assumes that the license and version lines are there, and adjusts the location of every warning with `location = location - (version+license)`. I'll have to change this bit to allow my warnings that start at 0, but it might get a bit hacky

This is ready for review now

I mean, in the end I felt like this wasn't a hack anymore, just another rule "if the error actually is about position 0, just keep it"

I'll fix it on the error duplicate removal layer, so we don't have to touch the tests part hopefully.

@cameel fixed it by ignoring the check for errors without SourceLocation

> Looks much neater overall.

> Weirdly, tests are failing due to gas differences. The PR does not touch anything that could trigger that though. Is `develop` broken?

let me rebase and run it locally

I just got these in my PRs. So yeah, `develop` must be broken.

@cameel now it all makes much more sense :)
