#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-09-03 13:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11890):

Reporting stack-too-deep errors is required for guiding the ``StackCompressor`` and ``StackLimitEvader`` in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493.
Simultanously, it can be used to guide the stack compression during stack layout generation itself.

This PR contains the changes to the StackLayoutGenerator in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493.

The ``_i > 16`` part is fine and I think I addressed all other comments.
