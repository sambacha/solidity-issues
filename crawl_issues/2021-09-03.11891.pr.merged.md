# [\#11891 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11891) `merged`: Allow the Rematerializer to be restricted to an exact set of variables.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-09-03 13:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11891):

In contrast to the old code transform, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11890 will provide a precise set of variables, s.t. rematerializing them will solve stack errors. In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493 this is exploited by having the ``StackCompressor`` run late and have it pass this precise set of variables to the rematerializer.

To that end the rematerializer needs to be restrictable to an exact set of variables (whereas before it was only possible to tell it to *additionally* rematerialize some variables).

This PR adds a simple flag for that, which will remain unused until https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493
