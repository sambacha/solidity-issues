# [\#11893 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11893) `closed`: Do not use the expression callback in memoryguard builtin code generation.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-09-03 14:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11893):

The new code transform ignores the expression callback and handles function arguments on its own.

However, contrary to all other builtins with literal arguments, the literal argument of ``memoryguard`` actually still ends up on stack despite being literal. Hence instead of visiting the literal argument, I directly push the constant in the builtin.

An extension of this is https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11894, which removes the expression visit callback from the builtins entirely - if we agree on that one, we can close this one, but merging one of them will be required for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493

Closing this in favour of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11894, since we seem to agree that that's better.
