~~Extension of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11893.~~
Entirely removes the visit function from Yul Builtins, shifting the responsibility of pushing the non-literal arguments to the code transform.

The builtins have no business defining how exactly argument evaluation takes place - and this actually simplifies things a lot.

Either this or https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11893 is required for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11493

I just added it to the user-end of ``generateCode`` - should I remove it from the ``generateCode`` implementations or also keep it there?

Removed setting the source location in the builtin code generator callback and added a comment about it being the caller's responsibility.
