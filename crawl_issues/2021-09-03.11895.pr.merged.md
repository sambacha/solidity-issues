# [\#11895 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11895) `merged`: Do not run evm codegen if not asked.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-09-03 15:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11895):

It's absolutely driving me nuts that the CLI always runs old codegen evm bytecode generation, even if I just ask for ``--ir``.
I have the CLI locally patched almost permanently because of that... (it's especially infuriating, if there are stack-too-deep errors, but I cannot even query the code that triggered it because of this)

Generally, I'd have said, we should get rid of the current CLI implementation entirely and replace it by a shiny fresh new (decidedly not generally backwards-compatible to crazy behaviour like this here ;-)) StandardCompiler-wrapper... but since for some reason we don't just do that, maybe we can at least patch this part :-).

I haven't checked that this is the exhaustive set of conditions that require evm bytecode generation, so it'd be good if someone double-checked.

What's up ;-)?

Anyone confident enough to be able to tell if this is all the cases now :-)?

I would be more worried about this not being all cases at some point in the future.

I'd hope that in the future this will all go through ``StandardCompiler`` :-). But yeah, there might very well be time in between...

It matches Standard JSON now so I think it covers all cases but I'm also worried about this getting out of sync in the future. I would be much more confident about approving this if `CompilerStack` had asserts against trying to retrieve stuff that was not generated. Or if we had tests covering all possible outputs. Then we could easily detect any mistakes. As it is now, something can easily slip through.

I don't think that worry is overly reasonable.
Whenever we would change anything here or add a new mode that would require evm bytecode generation, we'd add tests for it and/or at least somebody would run the thing once locally and would notice that it breaks due to not being added here.
And also, again: we should remove this entire set of logic anyways and reconstruct it as a thin wrapper of ``StandardCompiler`` anyways, which would solve the issue anyways.

Or  put differently: what precise realistic scenario are you worried about that would break anything due to this in the future?

True.

That this is a monster ought to break. Really should just do #9583.

This wasn't meant as saying "not to merge it", but rather "I can't be convinced to review this" ðŸ˜‰

Fair enough :-). Yeah, the sooner #9583 gets done the better, most definitely :-).

I got and idea today that we could break `CommandLineInterface` into a set of of smaller classes, each one dedicated to a single input mode (one for compiler, one for assembly, one for linker, etc.) and inheriting from a single base class with virtual methods like `processInput()`, `actOnInput()`, `formatOutput()`, etc. This would be a pretty easy refactor and then each part would be isolated enough to make rewriting it one part at a time pretty doable without making it a revolution. What do you think?

@cameel I actually just started to look into it, and the complexity does not seem to be in what you say, but the way all the parts are split into `handleXYZ`. Plus we are actually missing some features which are used by the CLI.

However your proposal definitely would improve the code and the readability of it.

Well, the `handleXYZ` is all compiler mode and it's just output formatting. Splitting would not reduce the complexity of that part but it would at least let us deal with that part alone without other distractions (like assembly mode) so rewriting that part would still be less work than rewriting all of it. For me one of the complications has always been that it was not clear which parts run under which conditions and that changing stuff in one place could potentially affect stuff I'm not aware about. With smaller parts you can reasonably expect to be able to understand each part completely before you rewrite it :)

I mean, my point is that I don't think that any part of the CLI is very complex or hard to rewrite. It's just too big to do it in one go in reasonable time.
