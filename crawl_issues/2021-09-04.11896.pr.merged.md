Implements part of #11846.

> This PR is in continuation to #11868 (i.e. contains changes made in the mentioned PR)

Deduplication
- `steps_b_ubu` template has been created amongst Test Templates (Line 163), to store the steps duplicated in `b_ubu_asan`, `b_ubu_clang`, `b_ubu_asan_clang` and `b_ubu_ubsan_clang`.
- `b_ubu_clang` has been used as the alias in `b_ubu_asan_clang` and `b_ubu_ubsan_clang`, in order to deduplicate the steps, while overriding and merging necessary discrepancies.
- `test_osx` template has been created amongst Test Templates (Line 195), to store the commands duplicated in `t_osx_soltest` and `t_osx_cli`.

@yatharthagoenka Please rebase this on top of #11880. I changed the PR base to the branch from that PR so that github will itnore commits from it when showing the diff.

Branch has been rebased on top of #11880.

@cameel 
Also, in the jobs `b_bytecode_ubu`, `b_bytecode_osx` and `b_bytecode_win`, while the commands are same, all of them have differing values so if we use an anchor/alias like we did in (664c5dd), it would use up almost the same amount of space in order to override the alias' values to their respective ones.
Could you suggest a different method to approach deduplication in this task?

Looks like github automatically closed this when the base PR was merged. Reopening.

I've been busy debugging the issues without binary hosting so I did not manage to review this (and some other PRs) yet. I'll try to get back to this tomorrow.

A parameterized job called `b_ubu_au_clang` was created to replace `b_ubu_asan_clang` and `b_ubu_ubsan_clang`.
The following references of the jobs were updated: 
- Workflow -> main -> jobs (Line 1106)
- Workflow -> nightly -> jobs (Line 1221 & 1229)

( @cameel Please verify the current implementation for parameterized jobs.)

Help Required: 
`b_ubu_asan_clang` and `b_ubu_ubsan_clang` have been referenced in the Workflow templates (239 and 244). How would we go about this reference using the parametrized job `b_ubu_au_clang`? (The current reference returns an error)

Aliases for `test_osx` were removed and the corresponding steps were nested using `when` condition.

@yatharthagoenka Are you still working on this? Do you need any help?

Hey @cameel, I apologise for the inactivity. I was at a remote location for the while, would be resuming the work right away.

@yatharthagoenka Do you mind if I take over and finish this PR?

Let me know if you still want to finish it yourself but I did some conflicting changes in #12173 so if you want to continue, please rebase on that PR.

@cameel is this still useful to keep open?

It's unfortunately very outdated after all the CI changes that went in in the meantime. I think a thing or two could be salvaged from it though.

I'll take it over.

This is now ready. Marking as draft though because I still need to remove the debug commit from the top once I make sure taht the CI passes.

I thought there wouldn't be that much left from this after rebasing it but suprisingly all the changes are still relevant and this makes the config much neater for some jobs. The refactors that went into `develop` in the meantime also make the diff here much more readable than it used to be. Thanks for the PR @yatharthagoenka!
