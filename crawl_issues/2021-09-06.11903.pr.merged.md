This adds `@ast-id` debug info, which is yet unused. For the AsmParser we currently have the following behaviour:
If `@use-src` is present on the object, the source location is taken from the `@src` annotations.

Do we also want to use this discriminator for whether or not we process `@ast-id` annotations? I think we should always process them. Although I think this means they could also be used in inline assembly - maybe we should at least prevent that.

Rebased - the parser could still be refactored a bit.

Based this on top of #11971  to make the tests work.

@cameel now the annotations are preserved after optimization.

@cameel I'll add getters to the "function debug info" PR.

actually it's not useful to do this in the "function debug info" because the getter is not analyzed internally, and it is fully inlined in the optimizer, so I'll add something here.
