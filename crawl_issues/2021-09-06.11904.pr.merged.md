# [\#11904 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11904) `merged`: Don't try to remove `soljson.js` after running `npm install` in cloned `solc-js` repo

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-06 19:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11904):

After https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/542 `npm install` in solc-js no longer automatically downloads the compiler binary. This is good but the PR check from solc-bin needs to be updated not to try to remove it.

This is the cause of CI failures in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/97.
