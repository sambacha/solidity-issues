I have disallowed `--error-recovery` option with input modes Standard json, Assembly and Linker modes. Also this is a template for all the other invalid options mentioned in the issue #11629.

@Midhun07 Are you working on this? Do you need help?

We have a ton of pending PRs right now and we'd like trim that number down a bit. If you don't have time for it, I can take over and finish it.

Some issues with b_osx which I don't seem to understand. I'm not sure if it is originating from my changes.

It's unrelated to your changes. We're getting this in external PRs lately and I'm not sure why. Tried to fix it in #12106 but that did not help. In one PR creating a branch on our side helped so I'll try to do it here too.

@cameel Shall I start pushing further fixes to this branch?

It's fine. The changelog entry needs some tweaking but other than that the PR is ready.

If you want the tests to pass, you can rebase it on #12106 but it's probably going to be merged pretty quickly anyway.

I mean, if you want to build on this PR, my suggestion would be to open a new one on top of it.
