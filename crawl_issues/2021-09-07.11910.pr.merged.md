Still todo:
- [x] check for nondeterminism in IR code generator (all files)
- [x] check optimizer stages to run in call-order.

This results in higher gas costs :)

It affects ABIv2 code in old codegen as well, doesn't it? Might be worth a changelog entry then...

Yes it does. I would also like to wait for the bytecode comparison :)

Also there is still a todo box to be ticked.

@ekpyron what would you suggest for the changelog?

Something like ``Bugfixes: Code Generation: Use stable source order for ABI coder v2 helper functions.`` or the like?
Maybe ``, fixing potential non-determinism.``?

Changelog conflict and unrelatedly breaking CI...

Not sure why we have to wait, but #11911 should also be fine to merge.
