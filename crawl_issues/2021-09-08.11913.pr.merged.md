~Depends on #11915.~ Merged.

This is the refactor requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11867#discussion_r701143568 and a bunch of other small tweaks that apply generally to `@src` tags even without code snippets.

- `Parser` tests were not checking for errors reported during parsing.
- A few more tests for corner cases related to whitespace.
- More general parsing. Tags are found first and then for each tag parameters are parsed separately.
    - This allows us to report an error in cases where the invalid tags were just being ignored until now. Note that this part is not strictly a refactor since it changes error behavior.

Rebased on top of #11915.
