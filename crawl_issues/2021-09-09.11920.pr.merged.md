# [\#11920 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11920) `merged`: User defined value type: changes in documentation and test case

Changed the name of a function from `truncate` to `floor`, since that is more appropriate; updated
the inaccurate description on the rounding behaviour. Also modified the respective semantic test.

But the two operations are actually identical on unsigned types, aren't they?

@chriseth The main issue was the old description "truncates to the nearest uint256 number". That was an incorrect description (well if you look at the "the nearest uint256 number" part independently)

I changed `truncate` to `floor` since that's more appropriate for decimal fixed points, although both should work.

Ah ok, `truncate` and `nearest` do not really fit together!
