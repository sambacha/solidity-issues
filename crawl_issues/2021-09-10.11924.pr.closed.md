How ASCII strings evaluate to integers was not immediately clear to me from reading the current documentation, before the clarifying discussions on Gitter. This PR contains (my understanding of) those clarifications. Please feel free to ask me to make changes/corrections, or to ignore this PR completely if you'd rather expand the documentation of literals in a different way.
