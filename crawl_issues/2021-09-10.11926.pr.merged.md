Hi,

In this PR I'm organizing state mutability and special functions parts of the documentation to corresponding sections.

Also I think that we should split [Visibility and Getters](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters) section to `Functions -> Visibility` and `State Variables -> Visibility` sections, again to add a bit more structure. I'll do this another PR later if you're OK with these changes.

Looks good!
