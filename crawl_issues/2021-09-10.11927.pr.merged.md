Made the following changes in this PR  (#11900): 

- [x] Add custom CSS file called "light.css" with the color changes as follows:
- Make code block background Solidity light grey: #E5E5E5
- Make titles / highlights Solidity light blue: #65AFFF
- Make hyperlinks Solidity electric blue: #002fa7
- Make highlights for searched words warmer yellow: #EAC545

- [x] In the dark mode CSS file, adjust the search highlight color to be soft red: #F0978B (yellow is currently not readable)
- [x] [optional] Add Solidity logo in the menu bar and delete logo from the index page
- [ ] [optional] Adjust font to Work Sans to be consistent with the font across blog, portal and docs

The CI failure is independent of the PR and can be ignored (that's just CircleCI acting up again).

As for the changed colors: one thing I'm noticing is that the new darker blue for links makes the links quite hard to read if switched to dark (using the toggle in the bottom left).

So should I change it back to the original color currently or maybe a different color for dark mode? ü§î

Switching back to the old link color only in dark mode would seem fine with me, but I'm not a designer, so I'd defer that question to you or @franzihei :-).

Good point I did not think about the hyperlink being too dark in dark mode. I think keeping the original hyperlink color in the dark mode would work great!

Hmm...I couldn't figure out the "empty space" scenario.

So, the changes I made acc. to review:
- refactored code wherever necessary
- updated the code blocks background to white and thickened the border
- made sure tho reduce space around logo as much as possible by removing the paddings and margins
- added a different color for the highlights in dark mode which provides better contrast
- deleted the light.css file and put everything in custom.css

@4molybdenum2 Looks like all the visual issues have been resolved :) I think that the final result looks good. Now @franzihei just needs to approve :)

There's just some general cleanup needed before this can be merged:
- I see that `custom.css` has 2-space indents and you followed that style. Which is good overall, but the file is very short so maybe you could just convert it to 4 so that we have it consistent in all CSS files?
- There are some files like `toggle.css`, where the only change seems to be adding a newline at the end. Could you remove these unrelated changes from the PR?
- There are a few places with inconsistent whitespace, e.g. missing space before `{`, empty line inside `{}` or no empty line between CSS definitions. Could you fix those? I pointed some of them in comments above.
- Commits should be squashed. We generally perfer one logical change per commit so review fixes should be squashed in to the commits they fix rather than left on top.

Sorry, I have been away for a while and could not get to working on the above changes.....will do so whenever I get the time.

@4molybdenum2 If you don't have time for it, I can take over the PR and finish it. You already did 99% of the work so it just needs some cleanup :)

Sorry I couldn't get back to it. I am currently away for the time being and lost track of itüòÖ .....I would really appreciate it if you could take over

I did the cleanup and also adjusted the link style so that visited link color is overridden only in the menu.

@franzihei Please take a look at this. Also, any feedback on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11927#discussion_r708379674?

Cool looks really good overall!

A few points:
- I personally really don't like the white-on-white in the code blocks. I'd prefer it to be the very light gray (#FAFAFA) we also use for code blocks in the blog (shown [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11900#issuecomment-925089250)). Also, what color is currently being used for the outline? It looks like black, which is a bit hard on the eyes imo. I'd prefer it to be similar to the blog, a slightly darker gray than the background. That being said, if everyone else likes it like this I'm also fine to keep it this way.
- Is it possible to change the "v0.x.x" back to how it was displayed before the changes? Now it is missing the "v" and is displayed in hard black, compared to a gray shade in the previous version. I can live with the black, but I find it strange that the "v" is gone - were any changes made on that front?

- Wrt to the "visited links" question: I really like how it's implemented right now. You can see what you visited in the documents itself, but not in the menu. Having a difference between visited and not visited in the menu will be highly confusing for the eyes and we also didn't have it previously, so I'd like to keep it that way. I think the menu in the index/home page still gives a great overview of what's been visited and what not (see screenshot). :)

@franzihei 
- Code block background changed to `#fafafa`.
- Border around code blocks was `0.01em` `solid` `#4a4a4a`. Tried to change it to `1px` `solid` `#cccccc` as on the blog but turns out that there's another border on the element the block is wrapped in (`.highlight-solidity`). The problem with overriding it is that I would have to do it for every language separately. Instead I just removed our border - the default one (`1px` `solid` `#e1e4e5`) looks pretty close to the one from the blog. Just has no rounded corners.
- About the `v`, see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11927#discussion_r708373582. In short: the `v` should appear there once docs are deployed to Read The Docs.
- I don't see anything here or in the issue about what the color of the `v0.x.x` part was meant to be but it looks to me like it matches the colors in your design. It's currently `#272525`. Is that too black? I can change it to anything you want.
