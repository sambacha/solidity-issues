I, by the way, wonder if we should disallow this and require accessing these with ``.offset`` in 0.9...

Must have been too late on Friday, I'll need another look at this.
EDIT: ok, the fix was ok, but the test was wrong. Also added a fix for the statically-sized calldata array case.

1) No code change for IR needed?
2) Can you check that we detect a missing assignment to a statically-sized calldata array and struct that is a return variable of a function? (no need for a new test if we already have one)

Apparently, we don't have any such test even for dynamic calldata arrays - I guess we said we test it for storage pointers and the check is identical in the code, so if it's fine for storage, it's fine for calldata (and it indeed behaves identically).
I can basically duplicate ``test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/controlFlow/storageReturn`` as a ``calldataReturn`` version, though.

The tests are passing - apparently in IR codegen this all falls under ``suffix.empty() && varDecl->isLocalVariable()`` in IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp:L115
