I guess we don't have tests for this option? Should be fine as long as the normal ones still work, and we only use it locally.

Well, I think we don't generally test the test scripts :)

And yeah, the option is meant mostly for local use. We do not really have a use case for it in CI so far, which is why no one added it so far.

Yea my point was more to be sure we're not breaking the test script for the general use.
