## Page
[Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html).

## Abstract

The Solidity Style Guide is not up to date with all the features added recently to the language. It needs to be updated

## Details
There are now good linters available, such as [solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) so I have doubts whether maintaining detailed guidelines independently of them is worth the effort. I think that having some general recommendations would be enough and the rest should be deferred to such tools. Still, as long as these guidelines are in the docs, they should at least be kept up to date.

The task here is to check, for each feature from the list below, if any of the existing recommendations should mention that feature, and whether a completely new section is needed. Then to create a PR (one per feature) with proposed new recommendations so that we can discuss them in more detail.

The priority should be to keep the recommendations concise and fairly general. Where possible, the existing text should be simplified. In cases that are currently underspecified we will need to come up with new rules - in those cases following the practices already established in the ecosystem or recommended by existing tools should be preferred over inventing something completely new.

### Features with missing guidelines
Here's an initial list of features that are either not mentioned at all of mentioned only briefly in the guide:

1. [ ] User defined value types,
2. [ ] Custom errors,
3. [ ] `revert` keyword vs the old `revert()` and `require()` functions,
4. [ ] `try`..`catch`,
5. [ ] Checked arithmetic,
6. [ ] Declarations at file level (functions, constants, etc.),
7. [ ] Immutable variables,
8. [ ] `override` (in case where more than one base function is being overridden),
9. [ ] `calldata` parameters,
10. [ ] Function call options,
11. [ ] Pragmas (version, ABIEncoder, SMTChecker).

The list is not exhaustive, there are very likely some features missing. Feel free to edit this description to add them or post them in the comments.

Hey, would I be able to update this for you guys?

Sure, just choose one of the features listed above and create a PR with your proposal. Then we can discuss the changes. I'd suggest to start small to get used to our PR workflow first. It does not have to be complete - even just doing a few changes at first is fine.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
