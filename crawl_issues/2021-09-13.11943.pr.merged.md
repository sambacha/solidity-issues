# [\#11943 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11943) `merged`: cmake: Remove stdlib compile option for Solidity build.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2021-09-13 09:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11943):

I'm not sure why we were force setting `-stdlib`. This creates a problem for the fuzzer build that actually uses `libc++`. I'm not sure why the setting being present wasn't a problem for the fuzzer previously. It may have something to do with how clang-14 processes command line options.

Anyway, I don't think removing the said flag is otherwise harmful.
