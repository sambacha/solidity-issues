# [\#11944 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11944) `merged`: Debug info selection

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-13 12:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11944):

Fixes #11858.
~Depends on #11867.~ Merged.
~Weakly depends on #11993 - `chk_codingstyle` fails because of trailing whitespace without it.~ Merged
~Weakly depends on #11991 - I have one empty input file in cmdline tests, which makes `xxx_cli` jobs fail.~
Now it actually depends on #11991.

I could work around the dependency on #11991 and #11993 but they'll likely go in first anyway.

Still work in progress:
- [x] Make it affect `--asm` output as well.
- [x] Error when used in input modes that do not need it.
- [x] Standard JSON setting.
- [x] Command-line tests.
- [x] Documentation + changelog.

I think we don't need to change the --asm output here.

Oh, well, I just finished making it support that option. I thought that the option was supposed to affect the EVM assembly too?

If it's not a big deal, we can also add it there.
