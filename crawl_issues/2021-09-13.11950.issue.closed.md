It would be very useful to add some functions converting different data types to strings. It will definitely increase the reach of solidity in fields other than Ethereum Blockchain.

IMO, this should be done by libraries. For one, there is no clear way to do this; so there isn't a strong reason to have this in the language. For example, for `uint256 -> string`, should it be in hex, decimals or binary? Should it have zero padding, etc?

Regardless, I would be curious to know what kind of conversions that you think should belong to the language.
