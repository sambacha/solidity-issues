# [\#11951 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11951) `merged`: Use locationOf helper instead of accessing debugData directly.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-09-14 07:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11951):

We had at least one null pointer dereference detected by nightly CI: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/18848/workflows/75f0fbf6-47ba-4cc1-8ab7-ee0883570fcb/jobs/838283.

This way, even if the idea is that eventually every node always has valid ``debugData`` (which is not the case currently), we can just change the helper to assert that instead of using an empty location as default.

I think this PR covers all occurrences of ``debugData->location`` in ``libyul`` that aren't already specifically guarded.
