# [\#11955 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11955) `closed`: User defined type constructors not visible across non-inherited contracts
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following program compiles,

```
contract C { type T0 is uint; }
contract D { C.T0 x; }
```

but the next one does not.

```
contract C { type T0 is uint; }
contract D { C.T0 x = C.T0.wrap(uint(1)); }
```

Found by fuzzing.

BTW, the constructor is visible in libraries but not contracts/interfaces.

```
library L {
  type T0 is uint;
}
interface I { type T1 is int; }
contract K { type T2 is bool; }
contract X {
  L.T0 y = L.T0.wrap(uint(1)); // works
  I.T1 z = I.T1.wrap(int(1)); // doesn't work
  K.T2 a = K.T2.wrap(bool(false)); // doesn't work
}
```
