# [\#11961 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11961) `closed`: Warnings should not be coloured red on the console

> I just noticed that `solc` formats both warnings and errors in red. Is that intentional? I saw the initial mockup in #3046 and there warnings were proposed to be yellow. But then #5511 had them all red for some reason and that's how it went in.

Looks like you beat me to it :) #11962.
I proposed white because they are not meant to stand out.

I'm going to close this one since my issue covers the same thing and has a more detailed description.
