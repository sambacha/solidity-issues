It actually seems to fail everywhere (except for Windows for some reason). In case of emscripten it seems to be because it needs `emcmake` in cmake command. Both ranges and jsoncpp set `CMAKE_COMMAND` for that reason.

I don't know why other platforms fail but it might have something to do with you setting `CMAKE_ARGS` simply to `true`. These other libs have an extensive set of parameters for it.

By the way, maybe it would be better to use `FetchContent` instead as in #11273?

@cameel I actually did `FetchContent` in 5510abd, but it had the same problem.

I'd refrain from rebasing this before the problem is solved though.

I guess this needs to be taken over?

I think this ran into some bug in one of the JSON output generators.

But also let's wait for https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/3130 to be fixed. (Well was just merged now.)

Let me know if there're any more issues. I've not explicitly tested with range-v3 but `std::ranges`. I expect 3.11.0 to be released soon (although it's not up to me).

Rebased and upgraded to nlohmann-json 3.11.2 which has proper ranges-v3 support.

Closing this as "postponed" for now. We'll keep the branch around as a basis for when we may pick this up again.
