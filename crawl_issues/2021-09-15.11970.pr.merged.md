> @shikharvashistha Could you please remove the formatting changes? It makes the PR rather hard to review now.

Greetings of the day @hrkrshnn ,

I'll remove the formatting. Actually it is caused by using clang-format file present in the source tree.

Thanks & Regards
Shikhar Vashistha

As a workaround for the CI not running here I have created a branch in our repo. You can see the results in [workflow 19529](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/19546/workflows/0b665723-5871-4e6b-a533-3c359370275a).

As you can see, there are lots of CI checks that do not pass. You can see the results by clicking "Details". The PR needs to pass them all to be correct.

I marked the PR as draft because it still needs some work. Please use the "Ready for review" button once all PR checks pass. Let me know if you need help with that.

Also, I think it would be more convenient for you to run these tests locally (see [Contributing > Running the Compiler Tests](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#running-the-compiler-tests)).

You still have lots of syntax and style errors but overall the PR goes in a good direction so to help you out a bit I cleaned it and fixed the errors. Let's see if it passes tests now.

Please take a look at it and see if you'd like to add anything. Then squash commits so that each one is a single logical change (without separate commits for PR fixes).

@shikharvashistha Thanks for the PR and for all the follow ups. I'll merge the PR now.

By the way, I checked how it works on a white terminal and looks like our output is completely broken so white used for `INFO` is the least of our problems. The messages themselves are invisible:

No one reported it so far so though.

So should we change the color for info ? to something visible, orange for example ðŸ¤” @cameel

Not really, it's not the info color that's the problem. We'd have to adjust colors to the terminal style somehow. It's harder to do and I'm not even sure if it's worth the effort (apparently not many people are using white terminals). I'd leave it as is unless someone complains.
