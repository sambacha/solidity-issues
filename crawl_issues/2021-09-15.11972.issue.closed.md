# [\#11972 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11972) `closed`: Builtin for UTS46 / IDNA normalisation
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

A recurring ask is to support ENS' namehash in the language: #6956 and #11436. The core reason for not being able to implement it in Solidity itself is the complexity of the [UTS46 / IDNA normalisation](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) required by ENS.

Instead of supporting namehash, we could just expose UTS46 normalisation and still implement namehash (which is a recursive keccak256 hashing) in the user layer, and eventually the standard library.

I suggest the builtin `toAscii(string memory) internal returns (string memory)`, which implements [this](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/#ToASCII). This builtin however should not be placed in the global namespace, but available through the special `idna` (or `uts46`?) namespace.

Example:
```solidity
import {toAscii as idnaToAscii} from idna;
```

Some UTS46 implementations: [1](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/master/packages/strings/src.ts/idna.ts) [2](https://github.com/danfinlay/eth-ens-namehash/blob/master/index.js) [3](https://github.com/jcranmer/idna-uts46/blob/master/uts46.js)

Here's a rough version:

```solidity
import {toAscii as idnaToAscii} from idna;
import "./stringutils.sol";

using strings for string;

function namehash(string memory name) external returns (bytes32 node) {
    // Normalise using UTS46
    name = idnaToAscii(name);

    // Special case: empty name
    if (bytes(name)[0] == 0)
        return 0;

    strings.slice memory slice = name.toSlice();
    while (slice.len() != 0) {
        bytes32 labelHash = slice.split(".").keccak();
        node = keccak256(bytes.concat(node, labelHash));
    }
}
```

Here's a version with assembly, which may or may not be correct (I only wrote it up as a comment and didn't even try compiling it):
```solidity
import {toAscii as idnaToAscii} from idna;
import "./stringutils.sol";

using strings for string;

function namehash(string memory name) external returns (bytes32 node) {
    // Normalise using UTS46
    name = idnaToAscii(name);

    // Special case: empty name
    if (bytes(name)[0] == 0)
        return 0;

    assembly {
        // We use the scratch space to keep the input for the hash, which is always: `node || label`
        // node is a fixed 32-byte value, while label is of variable length.
        // Here we ensure node has a proper starting value of 0.
        let scratch := mload(0x40)
        mstore(scratch, 0)

        let nameSize := mload(name)
        let nameStart := add(name, 32)
        let namePos := nameStart
        for {} eq(namePos, nameSize) { namePos := add(namePos, 1) } {
            // If we reached the end, or the denominator is found, process the backlog
            // This assumes short-circuiting
            if or(eq(namePos, nameSize), eq(mload8(nameStart), 46))
            {
                // Copy the current slice (assume we have this built in or a function above)
                // Could do without memcopying if we can modify the input string (as there's always enough space to mstore the node to)
                let sliceLen := sub(namePos, nameStart)

                // Clean the trailing bytes of the scratch
                mstore(round_down_32(sliceLen), 0)

                memcpy(add(scratch, 32), nameStart, sliceLen)

                // We always hash `node, label` here
                mstore(scratch, keccak256(scratch, add(32, sliceLen)))

                // Update the starting position to the byte after the dot
                nameStart := add(namePos, 1)
            }
        }

        // Load the final result
        node := mload(scratch)
    }
}
```

Perhaps similar to #10283, we should include this function below the `solidity` import/namespace.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
