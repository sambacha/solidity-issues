# [\#11973 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11973) `merged`: Fix command-line test filtering via script arguments

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-15 14:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11973):

Apparently #11933 broke support for specifying test name pattern in `cmdlineTests.sh`. This went undetected because we don't really use that feature in CI.

Originally patterns worked because we evaluated the whole argument list as the range of the `for` loop in side test dir. Now that we process arguments one by one, `selected_tests+=("$1")` just treats the pattern as a full test name specified verbatim.

The PR also adds a warning when one or more of the specified patterns match no tests.
