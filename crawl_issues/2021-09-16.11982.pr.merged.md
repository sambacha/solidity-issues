# [\#11982 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11982) `merged`: Split Common.h into Numeric.h.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-09-16 14:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11982):

`Common.h` is essentially included by everything and the hope of this split is that we at least don't need boost multiprecision everywhere.

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12004

Not really :) The changes are mind-numbing; it looks fine and passes the tests, so fine for me.
