# [\#11983 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11983) `merged`: Don't discard non-fatal errors in Yul mode in Standard JSON when followed by a fatal error

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-16 15:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11983):

In Yul mode `StandardCompiler` ignores any non-fatal errors collected so far when it encounters a fatal error. This results in a nonsensical message in some cases - for example when a path passed to `sources.urls` cannot be resolved by the import callback (a non-fatal error), it only prints a message saying that there were no input files (see the first commit).

Actually maybe approaching this in a very different way: if there are already errors in `InputsAndSettings`, does it make sense to process it further? I.e. we could just return an object with errors right at the beginning of that function if there are already errors.

Haha, that's how I did it initially, but then I thought that I should not stop if these were not fatal so I rewrote it like it is now :)

Should I go back to my initial version? I think it was better for this particular error (the message that there wasn't exactly one input file is confusing) but in others situations it might be better to continue. User will get more feedback in one go that way.

Yeah, maybe better to do it as you did it.

Rebased on top of the pylint fix.
