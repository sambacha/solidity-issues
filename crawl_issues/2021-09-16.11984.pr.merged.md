# [\#11984 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11984) `merged`: [CLI] Parse input mode earlier and add some asserts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-16 16:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11984):

A bunch of small refactors extracted from #11944.

- The huge `CommandLineParser::parse()` broken into smaller functions.
- Processing of `CommandLineOptions::input::mode` now happens earlier so that we can refer to it while validating all other options.
- Some extra asserts to make it clearer that some parts of `CommandLineInterface` will only ever run in specific input modes.

Fixed and rebased on `develop`.
