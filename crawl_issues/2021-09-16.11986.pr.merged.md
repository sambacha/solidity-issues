# [\#11986 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11986) `merged`: Fix pylint warnings about the usage of f-strings

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-16 17:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11986):

Looks like we're now getting failures in [`chk_pylint`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/19029/workflows/485209bf-fdcb-4e0d-bfe5-8679390a556f/jobs/845184) because pylint started complaining about `.format()` and `%` used for string formatting.

This PR fixes that by switching to f-string syntax.

Looks like `b_bytecode_ems` is failing because its python interpreter is too old (3.5.3). Fortunately I can bump the base image from `circleci/node:14` to `circleci/node:16`, which has Python 3.7.3.
