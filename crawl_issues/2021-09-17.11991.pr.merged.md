# [\#11991 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11991) `merged`: Fix handling of empty dirs and empty files in command-line tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-17 19:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11991):

After #11235, when `cmdlineTests.sh` finds an empty directory (which sometimes happens to me when editing tests and moving between branches), it assumes that it's a test with no empty files and empty stdin. This results in `solc` printing the command-line help, which is annoying and also probably confusing.

Also, `splitSources.py` assumes that the file it's processing is never empty.

This PR fixes these two problems.
