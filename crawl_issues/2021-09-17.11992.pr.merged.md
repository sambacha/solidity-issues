# [\#11992 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11992) `merged`: Rename existing debug info tests to match the new naming convention

The naming I suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11903#discussion_r709454244 was not entirely correct because it's a Standard JSON test, but not a Yul test (it has `language: Solidity`). Also we're now starting to call these comments just "debug info" rather than "source location comments" so I'm renaming it to be consistent with names I used in #11944.

I'm submitting this as a separate PR because #11944 already touches too many files.

Needs rebase :(
