# [\#11993 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11993) `merged`: Don't include whitespace after `@src` tag if there's no snippet

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-17 20:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11993):

This fixes a tiny bug in #11867. The was supposed to be no extra whitespace when the `@src` comment contains only location and no code snippet.

It's not that bad now because we do not have this in `///` comments yet. In #11944 this is actually making the code fail `chk_codingstyle` check due to trailing whitespace.
