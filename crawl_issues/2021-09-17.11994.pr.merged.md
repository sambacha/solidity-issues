# [\#11994 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11994) `merged`: `SMTSolverChoice` tweaks: fix `&` modifying the object and add more `const`/`noexcept`

I noticed that the `&` operator in `SMTSolverChoice` modifies its argument in place. This is a weird thing for an operator to do and probably just a bug.

While at it, I added `const` and `noexcept` in a few more places.
