# [\#11996 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11996) `merged`: Isoltest validation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50639790?v=4" width="50">[hawkess](https://github.com/hawkess) opened issue at [2021-09-18 12:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11996):

These are the current changes I've made that move defaults to the derived class constructor, explicitly define them for each option based on the values used to construct the `CommonOptions`/`IsolTestOptions` class and add `CommonOptions::validate` to the derived class's `validate`. 

This addresses the issue of hard coded overrides at the end of the parse chain, but with no way to negate a `true` default with a `po::bool_switch`, defaults essentially become permanent flags.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11916

@cameel Since this is just an internal tool, I'm fine with the default value being shown as either 1 or true.
