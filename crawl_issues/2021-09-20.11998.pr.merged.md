# [\#11998 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11998) `merged`: Store both Yul and Solidity locations in debug data

Fixes #11932.

- [x] ICE is gone but still not all errors from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11932#issuecomment-922848821 have locations. This might still be using the original location in places where IR location should be used.
- [x] Make sure nothing is broken and maybe add some tests if the current ones did not detect all the breakage.
- [x] Some of the updated lines should be using the `locationOf()` helper. I only started adding it halfway through.

I have the impression that AsmParser needs some more changes, but I might be wrong.

We have three modes for AsmParser:
1) native yul mode - irLocation and originalLocation should always point to the locations generated from the scanner ignoring the annotations
2) location override: This is used for snippets of yul code generated from solidity code in the old codegen. It probably makes sense for both to point at the solidity source location. We could also make the ir location point at the scanner location, but we probably don't have the actual source anymore at the point where we generate a potential parser error.
3) from comments: ir location points at scanner, original location is taken from comments

It might very well be that your code already accomplishes the above. If this is the case, it might be worth refactoring it at a later point in time to make the distinction clearer - especially if it is possible in 2) for the ir location to point at the scanner locations - in this case we can make it always point at the scanner locations.

I'll take a deeper look at that tomorrow. For now in a few places I wasn't really sure which location to take but just went with it to get it to a state where it compiles, with the intention to do one more pass through the code after that. Judging by test failures, I must have chosen wrong in some places :)

commandline tests are failing.

Yeah, I'm working on that.
