Hi 👋 

In #11926 I suggested to separate visibility section for state variables and functions in order for them to be more clear. For now I'm moving towards creating two sections `Contracts -> Functions -> Visibility` and `Contracts -> State Variables -> Visibility` and removing `Contracts -> Visibility and Getters` section.

Any comments and questions are welcome!

Looks like `b_osx` is failing, but it's unrelated to the PR. Some problem with an expired SSL cert when downloading gdbm.
