# [\#12000 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12000) `open`: Make source maps byte-offset based instead of opcode-offset

The source maps currently contain one item per opcode, instead of one item per byte in the assembly. This kind of makes sense because it allows the source maps to be flexible about which `push` opcode is used for a constant, but it makes it also more difficult because the "pseudo-opcode" AssignImmutable results in multiple opcodes in the end. To make things worse: As soon as one uses `verbatim`, it is taken as a single opcode by the compiler, but when just seeing the bytecode, it is impossible to tell whether a sequence of opcodes came from a single `verbatim` or multiple opcodes.

Because of that I would propose to make the source maps byte-based starting from Solidity 0.9.0.

This sounds good to me. Giving a heads-up to tooling people and perhaps asking for feedback would be nice.

Maybe we could make it start with a certain string to tell which kind it is and we could also include a version number.

Decision from design call: We will add a switch (maybe only in stdjson) that defaults to false. If it is true, the source maps will be byte-based and have a string prefix informing about that. The switch will default to true with 0.9.0.
