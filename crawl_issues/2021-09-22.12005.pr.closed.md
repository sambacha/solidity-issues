# [\#12005 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12005) `closed`: `"origin"` locations in Yul AST

Originally requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11998#discussion_r713163128.
Depends on #11998.
Related to #11043.

- [ ] Problem: the location does not always follow the format described by our docs on [Source Mappings](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/source_mappings.html).

I think we need to provide the source-name-to-index-mapping to the asm json converter in the same way we do it for the ASTJsonConverter - does this not work?

But that will work only if we have access to Solidity sources. When we're importing inline assembly AST we do, but this is the case where `"origin"` is superfluous anyway because it matches `"src"`. `"origin"` is only useful if we allow importing AST of a pure-Yul file and in that case we don't.

@cameel was this solved now?

Not really. I think this PR does not really make sense without implementing Yul AST output first (#9590). These origin locations will never show up for inline assembly.

Originally I wanted to implement #9590 and then put this PR on top of that. But I got into other PRs and didn't really have time for this one. I could close it but @chriseth seems to think this should actually work. I didn't want to close it without clarifying that first.

I'm going to close this. I definitely won't be working on this in the near future and like I said above, I'm not even sure if this PR even makes sense - it's only needed for Yul ASTs and we don't support printing those at this point.
