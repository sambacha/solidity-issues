## Abstract
The compiler does not complain if you use a contract or an interface in places where a fully qualified library name is expected. Such a reference can never work and should be reported as an error.

### Example
```bash
echo 'contract C {}' | solc - --libraries "<stdin>:C=0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
```
This does not produce an error even though `<stdin>:C` refers to a contract and not a library.

## Specification
Each fully qualified library name used in `--libraries`/`settings.libraries` that actually exists and refers to something else than a library should be reported as an error. For example in the above:
```
Invalid link reference: '<stdin>:C'. Not a library.
```

If possible, this should work that way not only for contracts but also for other names matching the reference. E.g. structs, enums, errors, events.

## Backwards Compatibility
The code that previously compiled fine with such references will no longer compile so it's a breaking change.

Sounds good!

Moving to implementation backlog then.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
