#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-22 17:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12011):

In  #11583 we made `--pretty-print` affect Standard JSON and also added the `--json-indent` option. There are still some command-line options that ignore these:
- `--asm-json`
- `--ast-compact-json`
- `--abi`
- `--userdoc`
- `--devdoc`
- `--storage-layout`
- `--metadata`

Some of them always pretty-print the JSON but with hard-coded indent size, some do not pretty-print at all. Change them all so that by default the JSON output is compact and changes when `--pretty-print`/`json-indent` is used.

We might want to exempt `--metadata` from this since we embed its hash in the bytecode and a pretty-printed version would not match it. But maybe that's ok - it's meant to be reproducible and being able to easily inspect it is also important. And in any case `--combined-json metadata` does get affected by `--pretty-print` so we already have this problem.

After changing it, we'll need to add pretty printing options to command-line tests to keep them readable. Alternatively, we could implement #7665 first.

## Backwards Compatibility
I don't think that we guarantee stable JSON formatting between versions so I'd say this is not breaking.

Changing the formatting for `--metadata` might affect tools that hash its output but also use `--pretty-json` to get nice output from `--combined-json` at the same time. I think it's a pretty obscure case though.

Creater PR for this issue, skipped metadata as it prints json in a bit different way

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
