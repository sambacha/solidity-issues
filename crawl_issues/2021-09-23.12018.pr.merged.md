# [\#12018 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12018) `merged`: Fix silent errors in AST import tests

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-23 15:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12018):

Validation errors reported from `--import-ast` make `ASTImportTest.sh` just exit, without providing any information about the failure. This PR makes it print the information about the problematic input file and compiler's stdout/stderr.

Somewhat related to #12017 - on top of having no debug info for failing assertions, `cmdlineTests.sh` does not even print what little info is there.
