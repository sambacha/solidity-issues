# [\#12019 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12019) `merged`: Default messages in assertion macros

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-23 16:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12019):

This is an attempt to improve the situation in #12017 a little. It should also be an improvement for external tools because for these our ICEs are often puzzling when they have no message at all (see e.g. https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/2849).

- Now if you use `""` in an assertion, it gets replaced with a generic message, like `"Solidity assertion failed"` or `"Unimplemented feature"`, depending on the assertion type.
- You can now skip the empty string in `solAssert()` and other assertions, making them more convenient.

Looks like MSVC does not like variadic macros very much...

Looks like it requires extra `#ifdef`s unfortunately: [`BOOST_PP_OVERLOAD`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_77_0/libs/preprocessor/doc/ref/overload.html).

By the way, is this something that should have a changelog entry? This might affect tools that try to detect some specific ICEs in the output and do some workarounds. We might want to at least inform them even if we do not guarantee any backwards-compatibility for these messages.

I don't think we should guarantee backwards compatibility in ICEs

Needs rebase
