By the way, we merged the workaround for `b_osx` failing in CI today (#12131) but only into `develop`, so we'll need to update `breaking` for your tests to pass. I'll submit a PR for that tomorrow.

As for the failing `b_osx` job, I have a PR to update breaking: #12150.

You could rebase on that branch but if you do, please also pull that branch into your fork. Otherwise github will automatically close this PR once we merge #12150 (I think it's because it wants to change base branch and it does not find one in the fork). Actually, I'm not 100% certain that this will prevent it from closing the PR but let's try it at least - it's annoying that it does that and it would be great to have a workaround for that behavior.
