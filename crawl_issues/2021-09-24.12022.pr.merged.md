# [\#12022 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12022) `merged`: [Docs] Always link to the latest version of Boost docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-24 13:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12022):

In some parts of the docs we're linking to Boost 1.69 but I don't think we actually mean that specific version. Might be better to use the boost version we use but we don't have one specific version - we allow a whole range. Since the latest version is always in that range, I think the best solution is to link to the latest version of the docs.
