# [\#12023 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12023) `merged`: Verify checksums of packages downloaded by scripts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-24 13:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12023):

We verify checksums in CMake and in docker images. This PR adds verification also to random scripts that download packages. Mostly for CI but not only.

~Note: this has wrong checksums right now because I want to make sure that this will actually fail in CI, especially on Windows.~ It has correct checksums now.
