# [\#12046 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12046) `merged`: Proper source mapping for immutables.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2021-09-28 12:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12046):

I'll squash soon (and again).

Comments made for understanding and prints for debugging reasons will be removed.

Fixes #9133.

### The problem

Each opcode should have a designated source mapping in the source mapping sequence. One immutable assignment though translates to multiple opcodes, even if it is only referenced once.
Also, the current source mapping computation did not take into account that an immutable can be referenced multiple times, which yields into even more opcodes.

The `bytesRequired()` I think was also buggy. I am not sure what the reason is behind the leading `1 + ...` .


### Notes / Open questions

- [ ] Some opcodes also did not have any source mapping, such as `INVALID` at the end of an assembly or the sub assembly referencing opcodes. The documentation states that those have a source file mapping assigned of `-1`, but there is none.

Looks good! Let's see if it is always set.

So it seems the assert is triggered, currently investigating the ci failers

I think it's due to the `codeSize` call in `Assembly::assemble` - could add a flag for that use-case that the result is not 100% important.

If we use the approx. in the optimisers, it will increase the gas at a few places (see tests in new commit). Is that acceptable for us? Alternatively I could add a third option to the `Precise` enum called `IgnoreImmutables` for example.
