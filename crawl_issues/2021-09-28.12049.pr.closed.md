Versions using the syntax `>0.8.8` would cause an error in the CI if you are on
that version due to the removal of the `greater` check in c63fd0a1af

This adds that check back.

Regarding tests, I rebased https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12016 on this PR and now the pragma_version_check test succeeds

The check was correct. It will use your local version if you have 0.8.9 in `CMakeLists.txt`.

I think that the problem is elsewhere. Looks like version in `CMakeLists.txt` has not been bumped to 0.8.9 in #12038, which is what we'd normally do (see e.g. #11788 or #11568).
