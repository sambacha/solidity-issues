# [\#12069 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12069) `merged`: Remove leftovers of `compact-format` and `interface` from `--combined-json`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-09-30 20:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12069):

These two values are completely ignored by the compiler but they're still valid as `--combined-json` arguments. This PR removes them.

Technically it's a breaking change, but this option has already stopped doing what it was originally supposed to do so at this point it's just cleanup of stuff that's already broken.
