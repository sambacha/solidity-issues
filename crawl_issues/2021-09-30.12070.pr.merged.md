~Depends on #12069. In draft mode until that PR is merged.~ Merged.

A small refactor to bring the structs that represent sets of boolean flags for selecting compiler outputs more in line with what I did with `DebugInfoSelection` in #11944. Now they use maps of pointer-to-members to avoid enumerating fields by hand - this gets really repetitive and error prone with structs that have 15+ fields.

This is needed for the next PR which actually changes the validation logic.

#12069 has been merged so this is now reviewable.

Yeah, I did some manual testing in #12074, which is on top of it. I did not test every single flag but we do have test coverage for some of these flags (in command-line tests and some in the new tests for solc) and if they're not broken, I doubt the others are.
