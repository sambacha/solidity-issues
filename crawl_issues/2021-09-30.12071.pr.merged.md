# [\#12071 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12071) `merged`: Validate selected compiler outputs on the CLI

Implements part of #11629.
~Depends on #12070. In draft mode until that PR is merged.~ Merged.

This makes the compiler report errors when outputs that are unavailable in the current input mode are selected via CLI flags.

This was originally a part of a bigger PR that enables output selection in assembly mode but it actually also makes sense on its own and can be considered a separate feature/fix.

#12070 merged so this is now reviewable.

This change is technically breaking, but it could be argued that it's a bugfix (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11730#discussion_r706150636) if we consider missing CLI validations bugs rather than missing features.
