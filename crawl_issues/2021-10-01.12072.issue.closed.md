https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.9/contracts.html?highlight=immutable#constant-and-immutable-state-variables

## Abstract

Should we prefer:

```
public immutable
```

Over

```
immutable public
```

I think we should go with the style guide's existing [recommendation for function modifiers](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/style-guide.html#function-declaration).

`immutable` does not fit into any category on that list though. It's a data location like `storage`, `memory` or `calldata` and you cannot have these on functions so they're not listed.

haha I was thinking `mutability` but I realize now that's different

still think we keep visibility first in line with functions !  ðŸ˜„

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
