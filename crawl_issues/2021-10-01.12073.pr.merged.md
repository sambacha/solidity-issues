It is a draft version, only want to run all CI

The overall concept looks good. From failing tests I think you must have just missed a few cases.

The case I described in #10298 should also be added as a command-line test.

Is this a breaking change?

@chriseth Technically it is since this removes support for linking the old-style references but the compiler no longer generates them so I really doubt it will break anyone's workflow. You'll only ever see any breakage if you compile and link separately, using different compiler versions. Changelog says that we switched to new-style references in 0.5.0, which means that you'd have to be compiling a 0.4.x contract and then doing `solc --link` on 0.8.10+.

@soroosh-sdi Is this ready for review now? I switched it to draft because that's what you said in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12073#issuecomment-931932680 and you seemed to be still working on it. Please use the `ready for review` button if this is ready.

The only remains thing is the test you wanted.
I'll set it to ready when I pushed a new test case

This PR is ready now, but I see two unrelated failures in CI. @cameel

Yeah, don't worry about it :) I finally have a workaround for these: #12106. You can rebase on it if you want all tests to pass but hopefully it will go into `develop` tomorrow anyway. I see that all my PRs that I rebased on it are now green.

Thanks, that part is the most interesting part of this task for me :)

Just added that

Could you please merge this PR?
@cameel 
EDIT: Oh, I see you requested a review from Chirseth. so I can wait.

Yeah, I wanted at least one more person to have a look at it before we merge it, mainly because of the parser change and the stuff with `:L` vs `L` on the command line.

The changelog entry I suggested turns out to be a bit hard to understand so it needs to be adjusted:
```
Commandline Interface: When linking only accept exact matches for library names passed to the ``--libraries`` option. Library names not prefixed with a file name used to match any library with that name.
```
After that this can be merged.
