Resolves #3870.
~Depends on #12071. In draft mode until that PR is merged.~ Merged.

This does not add any new outputs, just makes the ones that are already available respond to output selection flags so e.g. `--ir` is not available. We can 

Also, to make this non-breaking, all outputs are selected if no flags are specified, which is different from how the compiler mode behaves. If this goes through, I can create a separate PR to `breaking` branch to change that.
