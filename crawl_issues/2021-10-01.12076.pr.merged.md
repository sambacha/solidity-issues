# [\#12076 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12076) `merged`: Error helpers + small refactors in `cmdlineTests.sh`

A bunch of small tweaks to improve error reporting extracted out of my upcoming PR for #11877.

The biggest part is a helper Bash function that takes a command, and, if that command fails, prints stdout, stderr and exits. Doing this manually after every command adds a lot of boilerplate. I'll have 5 commands to handle so at this point it's more efficient to just write one reusable helper. It's also already useful in `cmdlineTests.sh` because there are a lot of places where we expect success and stderr gets sent to `/dev/null`. The helper will make debugging test failures there easier.

Other than that there are a few small refactors: `fail` helper, removal of `--force` from `rm`, unnecessary `set -e` in a few places and one missing `rm -r "$SOLTMPDIR"` (finally my `/tmp` won't be filled with garbage after running these tests). I have also enabled `set -o pipefail` - looks like it does not cause any spurious failures in this script.
