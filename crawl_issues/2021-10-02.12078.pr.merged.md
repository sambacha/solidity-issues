with this change we don't have to build antlr, which was failing on non amd64 architectures. Using the ubuntu packages is easier, and I hope will fix the errors.

@leonardoalt looks like the [CVC4 repo](https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4-archived) has been archived back in May and they're releasing [CVC5](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5) now. Do we support both? Should we suggest using CVC5 now in docs?

Thanks for the review. I've fixed the error.

I don't think cvc5 has a stable release yet: https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/releases

Ah, ok then.

Our CVC4Interface might not work with CVC5 because of a different ABI, so I'd say we just stay with CVC4 for now.
