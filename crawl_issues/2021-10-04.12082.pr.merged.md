This is working now apart from recursive function calls. I'm actually wondering if it would be better to finish implementing `ControlFlowBuilder` on the full Yul AST and then doing reachability analysis there.

Ok actually I think ControlFlowBuilder cannot be really used, but essentially something that actually builds a graph.
