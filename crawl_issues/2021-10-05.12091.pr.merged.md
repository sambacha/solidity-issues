I think it might really make sense to cache the side-effects in the context (same is true for the other side-effects as well).
If optimizer steps are semantically-equivalent transformations, then it should be OK to compute the side-effects once per optimizer loop iteration.

Performance does not seem to be as big an issue as I thought.

Fuzzer update:

There is a stack-use-after-scope here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/863a0d3b9c4b180dc0b149def38384316df0ec2c/libyul/ControlFlowSideEffectsCollector.cpp#L215

(see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10973#discussion_r580926054 for discussion on a similar issue)

I am not sure if YulString as an rvalue reference temporary is the issue. At least one of similar issues in the past could be fixed by replacing temporary with a value on the stack. (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11371)

Before merging this, some tests may need to be modified so that they are still purposeful.

Changed the tests to be meaningful, please double-check.

I think this could need some more tests in the relevant optimizer steps.
