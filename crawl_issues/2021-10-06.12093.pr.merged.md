The publish Solidity security policy should be helpful to people when deciding which version of Solidity to use. So a reference is added.

My goal here is to make this language as strong as the Solidity team will allow. My preference is:

> Use the latest released version of Solidity for your projects. DO NOT USE older versions as they have known problems and/or may not receive fixes.

Totally fine, @fulldecent  - my comment was mainly about restructuring the paragraph so that it is clearer why we only recommend the latest version.

@fulldecent Can you squash your commits and rebase on the latest `develop` (which has a workaround for the failing `b_osx` job)?
