I think the initial report was also about built-in functions, would be nice to also include them (if it does not take too long).

This PR has been stale for a long time, and is marked as `takeover`. I'd suggest closing the PR (@ekpyron agrees), since whoever takes on the issue might wanna rewrite their code, if the issue is important enough. This code will still be available in the branch. Please reopen if needed.
