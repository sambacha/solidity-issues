# [\#12098 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12098) `merged`: Reformat `standard_optimizer` command-line tests for readability

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-06 16:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12098):

Small refactor of command-line tests that check validation of optimizer options. Separate PR because in #11830 I want to see only actual changes resulting from the new feature.

The most important part here is the pretty printing so that on changes do not result in the whole test output just being red in the diff. While at it I also extracted test input to standalone files and made formatting consistent.
