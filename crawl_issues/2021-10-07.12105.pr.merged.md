# [\#12105 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12105) `merged`: Extra debug info about unknown exceptions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-07 15:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12105):

We can use `boost::current_exception_diagnostic_information()` to get some info about the exception (in particular its type) even in the `(...)` handler. Also, `boost::diagnostic_information()` works with `std::exception` too.

Related to #11762. Does not depend on it but also does not touch the handlers refactored in that PR.
