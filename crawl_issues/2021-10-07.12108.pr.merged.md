# [\#12108 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12108) `merged`: Fix broken Remix link style

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-07 19:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12108):

Looks like I accidentally broke the CSS when I was rebasing #11697 on top of #11927. The missing braces make the browser completely ignore the style for Remix links.

The PR also slightly adjust spacing of the `Credits and attribution` link in the footer.
