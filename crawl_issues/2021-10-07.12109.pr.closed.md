Yes. #11762 had the macOS CI failure. It was an external PR so I created a separate PR on the same branch to check if it will have the same problem as an internal PR. I added `closing #...` to both PR descriptions so that merging either one would close the other. Surprisingly, CI checks finally passed in #11762 so this PR got closed automatically.
