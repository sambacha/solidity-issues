# [\#12115 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12115) `closed`: [docs] Getters: add example using a complex getter

In the getters section of the documentation a simple example is given (with uint), then another simple example (with array), and then a quite complex example (called ``Complex``) that has a public mapping from uint to other mapping from bool to an array of a struct containing uint, a mapping, and dynamic and fixed size arrays of different types (uint and bytes)).

At least for me, it wasn't quite easy to grasp ``Complex`` at first (for example, it wasn't that intuitive what exactly was ``arg3``).

This PR adds a simple contract with loads some data and use the getter to retrieve it, so that ``Complex`` is easier to grasp.

Thanks for your pull request! While the complex example takes a while to understand and you creating code for it certainly helped in understanding it, I fear that just adding the example here does not really help others. Thanks a lot anyways!
