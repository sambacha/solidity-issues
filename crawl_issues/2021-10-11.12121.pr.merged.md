Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9211

Looks good in general. I think there is some code duplication and we should also check if everything works as expected when the name of a function is changed in an `import` statement.

There is an annoying problem here. One difference between libraries and free functions in using for statement is that, unlike `using LibraryName for T`, `using free_function for T` can be immediately type checked.

But this has issues for
```solidity
function sum(uint[] calldata arr) returns (uint partialSum) {
    for(uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        partialSum += arr[i];
    }
}
contract C {
    using sum for uint[];
    function f(uint[] memory arr) external returns (uint) {
        arr.sum();
    }
}
```
The underlying type `uint[]` has to be treated as a storage type (the default location?). But at instantiation time, we need a conversion from `memory -> calldata`, which is not possible. There are two ways to proceed here:

If we really want `using X for T;` to be type checked at declaration time, then we should allow `using f for uint[] calldata;`
The other option is to individually type check during the calling, which doesn't look nice.

What do you think @chriseth

What about doing type checking right away for non-reference types and delaying it if there is at least one storage location that works?

I could do that.

> it if there is at least one storage location that works?

This might be tricky, but I can try.

The current implementation performs type checking at the `using for` place when the overload is unique and not a module. Type checking is delayed to the call location if there are overloads.

The above is wrong: `using {f, g} for uint;` requires `f` and `g` to be unique.

Currently, `using {f} for x` fails if `f` is overloaded. Do we want to change that?

Also @cameel thinks that `using X ...` and `using {X} ...` should be fully equivalent, and I kind of agree.

Instead of `export using ...` we could use `using {f, h} for MyType sticky;`

Having thought about this, I believe a simpler specification / implementation might make sense for now:
- If `{...}` is used, it can only contain a list of functions (but they can be library functions)
- I would drop `using ModuleName for ...`
- `using LibraryName` is not allowed at file level (we can change that later)
- If `using { ... } for MyType` is used at file level and `MyType` (struct, enum or type) is defined in the same file at top level, the functions are available everywhere the type is available - if we can come up with a good keyword, this can still be changed

In summary, the change to how it was before this PR:
 - add `using {...} for ExplicitType` (no `*`)
 - allow `using` at file-level, but only in the `{...}`-form and make it auto-attach

We can even think about disallowing `using` at file-level on types that are not defined there.

We have to check what happens when a virtual function is referenced.

virtual functions are of course not a problem because they cannot be referenced: The functions have to be free or library functions and this is already checked.

Do we have a test case for using a function multiple times in the list? ``using {f, f} for``?

Oh, and it probably wouldn't hurt to have a test for importing a file that uses a global ``using``, checking that the attached functions are no longer available after import.

When we have `using {..., f, ...} for T`, we should enforce that the first parameter of `f` is equal to T up to data location, because it is less confusing and we also will get fewer problems with operators.

I'm growing less and less fond of function overloading. Rust made a good decision to ban it altogether.

Fair enough - I'd still expect this to be annoying as long as there generally is function overloading - but yeah, at least a test case would be nice in any case.
