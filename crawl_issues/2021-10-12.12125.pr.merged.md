- Depends on #12124

A tiny bug I noticed while working on #11800. We're returning 0 even though the operation failed.

Related question: why does `CommandLineInterface` not fail immediately when `createFile()` fails? Instead it has this weird `m_error` variable and checks it when it has finishes printing all the output and only then fails. Can we change it so that it fails right away?

Feel free to change the error mechanism!

Great. I added a commit changing that to #11800 then.
