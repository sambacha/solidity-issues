Since london, it could be cheaper again to use the identity precompile than mload / mstore in a loop to copy memory.

I think only Berlin's EIP-2929 affects it, and nothing in London does.

However if the saving is not significant, then to avoid the potential for future repricing adversely affecting it, I would not enable it.

Some relevant discussion from the chat:

@hrkrshnn 
> A random idea: about this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12127. I think we should do it, a rough calculation is that a precompile staticcall should cost  about the same in case of  copying 2 words and get cheaper for more than 2 words.

> [RedundantStoreEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11352) can already deal with memory read and written by `staticcall()` just as if it was a pair of `mload()`/`mstore()` and it does not really care about the content being read/written.
> [EqualStoreEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12272) on the other hand only deals with simple single-slot store operations.

I guess that with the builtin we could just assume that the precompile does not read or write any storage?

@hrkrshnn 
> Yeah, there are two things here. Loops are hard to work with. So if we can replace a for loop doing `mstore` by `memcopy`, analysis becomes easier. The other thing as you said is if you replace the loop by `staticcal(gas(), 4, ...)`, we'll need to start modelling `staticall` opcode's side-effects based on the address it calls.

I'm in favour of having a built in yul, especially if it can be also used in inline assembly. Though we may want to consider making this more generic.

Marking as breaking since the way we will probably implement it (i.e. as a new Yul builtin) seems to be breaking.

I think it should be possible to implement it in a way that's not breaking. We did this when `basefee` was introduced. Alternatively, this can be an annotation similar to "memory safe", but for selecting the Yul dialect.

You mean, introduce the new builtin, but still allow to shadow it with user-defined functions (emitting a warning or so)? Yeah, always possible, never really nice, though... we could actually consider that for ``prevrandao``, though.

ok, if we have that option then I guess I'll remove the label since whether it's breaking or not will simply depend on whether we decide to do it in 0.9.0 or before.

Didn't we have a PR about this? Just because IIRC recently we changed our evmc/evmone integration to properly account for precompile gas, so now that PR should actually properly account for the gas difference.

We did: #12556.

@hrkrshnn wanna try again? :)

I have a feeling it's better to wait for https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656 (memcpy) for this. There are some edge cases with the identity, when not enough gas is provided: https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/4f2210b59aefa119769a154a12e55d9b77ca64eb/contracts/helpers/PointerLibraries.sol#L226, and we should try to push for `memcpy` in Cancun or something very soon.

Well, if we do that, we may as well close this with the answer to the question raised in the issue being "no".
