The ir generator creates the external call dispatch routine and it contains cases that all end with `return(...)`. The fact that we return at that point cannot really be used by the optimizer for the inner functions unless all the inner functions are inlined into the main dispatch routine.

We should try if outlining the cases into individual functions might provide a better result.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
