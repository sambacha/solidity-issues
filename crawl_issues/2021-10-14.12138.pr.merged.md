# [\#12138 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12138) `merged`: Fix index link appearance in docs menu

Fixes some small breakage in docs layout:
- The plain `<a>` element used for "Keyword index" for some reason gets styled the same way as if it was the currently selected menu option. RTD theme adds a `[+]` buttons to such options when they're selected but the button does not get styled correctly.
    - I changed the HTML generated for the link to more closely resemble the HTML for other menu items (it's a list now). This fixes the issue.
    - One remaining issue is that "Keyword index" does not get highlighted when it's the selected option. But this is a separate problem and was there even before my fix.
- The version toggle was obscuring the index link. I slightly increased the padding at the buttom to fix this.
