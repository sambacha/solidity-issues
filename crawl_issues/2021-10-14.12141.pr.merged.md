@ekpyron Are we fine with the extra time it adds to CLI tests?

30 seconds, is it? That's hardly noticable compared to the total runtime, isn't it :-D?

Or you can move them to the end - to be honest I'm hardly ever patient enough to wait for the AST import tests locally anyways :-).

These things add up quickly and CLI tests are still much faster than a full soltest run. I'm cautious about making it longer without a good reason. Something on the order of ~1 min is a relatively big change.

It's already far down, behind all the individual cases and also a few other things.

I mean, recently @Marenz even suggested refactoring the CLI test script to be able to select specific tests from the ones that run after individual cases so it does matter somewhat.

This can also just be a specialized test, maybe even its own script, but I think it is important to run it on a multi-file and multi-contract example.

Ok, I'll refactor it for multi-file and multi-contract in that case.

Do we still want to merge it as is to have something for now or only once it covers these cases?

I suppose only merge after @chriseth responded positively to your question ^^

I'm going to merge this to avoid keeping it open and clogging our PR queue and do the refactors in a separate PR.
