# [\#12142 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12142) `merged`: Assert and stack traces for Bash scripts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-14 16:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12142):

While working on #12141 I was really missing a quick way to assert stuff and the lack of a proper stack traces when a script fails makes debugging really annoying. This PR adds a rudimentary helper that can print a stack trace and a function that we can get an assert-like failure.
