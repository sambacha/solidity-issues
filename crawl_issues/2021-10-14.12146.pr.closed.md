As per discussions in the linked issue, I just need to modify the compilation so it builds for debug and not release mode.

You need to rebase on latest `develop`. This was fixed in #12131.

I've been having trouble with Ubuntu taking the PPA or maybe it's something I'm misunderstanding.

```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libboost-all-dev libz3-dev
```

These are the versions that get installed after running the above.

```
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libboost-all-dev libz3-dev

> We normally require the latest stable version (4.8.12) because that's the only version where SMT tests will pass. We maintain a PPA that provides this version (see Installing the Solidity Compiler > Linux Packages).

I'm still getting this when trying to compile

```
-- Found Z3: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz3.so (found version "0.0.0") 
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:74 (message):
  SMTChecker tests require Z3 4.8.12 for all tests to pass.

  Build with -DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF if you want to use a different version.
  You can also use -DUSE_Z3=OFF to build without Z3.  In both cases use
  --no-smt when running tests.
```

So I'm not sure why it's not installing 4.8.12 for libz3-dev. I did take a peek in ppa:ethereum/ethereum and it doesn't appear to reference libz3-dev unless It's in another dependency.

The build dependencies are not in the official release PPA repository (you don't need them if you just want to install the compiler binary), but in a separate dependency repository: https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps. The required z3 package in that repository is called ``libz3-static-dev``.

So maybe try
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/cpp-build-deps
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential libboost-all-dev libz3-static-dev
```
?

Thanks @ekpyron! I'll give that a go. ðŸ˜Ž

Thanks @ekpyron. That ppa definitely fixes the z3 version issue. ðŸ˜Ž

@cameel, I don't think it makes sense to build the source when the container pre-builds as that might not be the action a contributor wants to take. I would assume they'd want to investigate the issue/feature first and then compile when they feel it's necessary. This way as well, it does not force them into a specific compilation, i.e. flags passed to build.

I think having gitpod as an environment with the appropriate dependencies in place for someone to contribute on the project makes the most sense, and not bothering with building source right away, but would love your feedback.

Once we've decided what makes sense for gitpod, I will also update documentation so that folks are aware that gitpod is an option for contributing to the project.

I know that you put a lot of effort into this, but we discussed it again in the team and concluded that we do not want specialized configuration files inside the repository. If gitpod starts a general standardization effort that is used across many IDEs we might reconsider this. Otherwise, we feel that the configuration file should better be stored with gitpod instead of inside the repository itself.
