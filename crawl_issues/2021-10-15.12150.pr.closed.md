			!declarations.empty()
		)
		{
			SecondarySourceLocation ssl;
			for (auto const* decl: declarations)
				ssl.append("The shadowed declaration is here:", decl->location());
			if (!ssl.infos.empty())
				m_errorReporter.declarationError(

Maybe actually better to wait for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12151

Does not matter all that much. Having #12151 would be nice because it's a proper fix and makes `b_osx` job complete faster but `develop` already has a working workaround so even without that PR this update is enough to have PRs based on `breaking` pass.

Closing in favor of #12164, which has the full CI fix and no conflicts to resolve.
