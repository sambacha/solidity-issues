# [\#12151 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12151) `merged`: Remove CircleCI+Homebrew workarounds

The response from CircleCI regarding the workarounds we had to do in #12106/#12131 made me realize that maybe we can just remove the `brew update` that causes this problem in the first place. We added it in #11267 because of the breakage caused by Boost binaries moving away from bintray - a newer version of Homebrew was needed to resolve it. Looks like CircleCI updated Homebrew in their images so `brew update` is no longer needed.

Nice!
