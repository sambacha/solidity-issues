An addition to issue #10738
couldn't change boost::for_each to
std::for_each, doesn't compile.

There's `ranges::for_each()`, which might work but actually I don't see much point in using it over a normal range loop:
```c++
for (Type& value: container)
    foo(value);
```
This is already pretty compact and does not hide the loop so I'd recommend using it instead of `for_each()`.
