Hello @akali. Thanks for the PR, but unfortunately I've been too quick in labeling this as `good first issue`. Turns out that the issue still needs some discussion due to how it would affect tools (especially Truffle). This will take a while because right now many people are at a conference in Lisbon.

In the meantime, maybe you'd like to try some other issue that can be implemented right away? Here are some suggestions:
-  #12119
- #12011
- #10275
- #9601

No worries, I'll try to work on another one
