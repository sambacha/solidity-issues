There are two open hardhat PRs that need to be merged first:
- nomiclabs/hardhat#1962 fixes two failing tests on 0.8.5.
- nomiclabs/hardhat#1969 lets us use an absolute path to the soljson.js executable which removes the need for a workaround.

Also, I made it a PR check because it's pretty fast (runs in under a minute) but given that this depends on Hardhat's `master` branch, maybe it would be better to run it only nightly to avoid accidental breakage blocking our PRs?

All dependent issues have been resolved on Hardhat side and now `t_ems_ext_hardhat` succeeds so this is now ready for reviews.
