@Midhun07 Thanks for the PR. Could you please follow up with the changes that cameel requested?

@hrkrshnn @cameel  I have added changelog change. Other changes I need some help as in I just want to know how to check the values of the options. Like for example: `metadata_hash=swarm` How to check this option? Simple checking like other options is not working. Please help.

For most options `m_args.count(optionName) > 0` should work. For options that have default values and are always present because of this, you must check `!m_args[optionaName].defaulted()` instead.

@cameel My problem is that the message `The following options are not supported in the current input mode: --metadata-hash` is the error produced but the test compares that message against the message: `The following options are not supported in the current input mode: --metadata-hash=swarm`.  Is there any way to append `=swarm` apart from the usual string append? I mean something like `joinOptionNames`.

Well, you can do it in several ways:
- Split on `=` and remove everything after it when comparing.
- Have a more complex data structure. I.e. under `--metadata-hash` store both the allowed modes and a version with parameter value (`--metadata-hash=swarm`). Pass one into the command, use the other for comparison.
- Have two separate lists, one for options with values (and include the value there), one for options without.

I mean, you don't have to stick to the current stucture at all cost. You need to adjust it for this to work.

@Midhun07 Could you please rebase into develop instead of the merge? That is our workflow.

@hrkrshnn I have rebased my branch on top of `ethereum:develop`. Not sure though if it had worked properly. A little help would be much appreciated. Some 14 new commits have crept in. Not sure if this is the right way.

@Midhun07 I think you must have forgotten to pull in the latest commits into your local `develop` branch before rebasing.

Actually looks like it's something else. I'd have to look closer to see what actually happened but it was definitely now what should have happened :)  In any case it's the result of the branch not being properly rebased. If something like this happens and you're not sure what's wrong it's usually a good idea to visualize the branches. E.g. with `gitk --all` or `git log --all --graph`. The problem is usually easy to see.

Anyway, I rebased it properly and pushed just now.

This needed a rebase and had some small issues (tabs in the middle of a line in a few places, not all options listed in the changelog. Also we have just released 0.8.10 so the changelog entry should go to 0.8.11 now.

I fixed these and pushed my changes to your branch.

Not all comments above are resolved so I cannot approve yet. Please take a look at them and let me know if any of them is problematic.

Hi @cameel, I have been trying to implement the suggestions. The `string_view` isn't working fine. I'm not able to reconstruct the original string back. It is printing garbage. Here is what I'm trying to do.

`string_view optionNameWithoutValue = optionName.substr(0, optionName.find("="));`
this is to get the address and the length of the substring. And then to reconstruct it:
`string(optionNameWithoutValue.begin(), optionNameWithoutValue.length())`.

I have tried this on a template and there it was working fine. For some reason it is not working here. Is there any issue with this reconstruction? Also I have been trying to debug using `soltest.sh --debug`. But the working of the test cases is little different from a normal execution i think. I'm not able to print the value of the variables.

@Midhun07 Try `string(optionNameWithoutValue)`.

But I'm really surprised that the operator for adding a `string_view` to `string` is not available in C++. Apparently it's by design: [Why is there no support for concatenating std::string and std::string_view?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44636549/why-is-there-no-support-for-concatenating-stdstring-and-stdstring-view/47735624#47735624).

This makes this change pointless so, well, let's go back to `string`.

> Also I have been trying to debug using `soltest.sh --debug`. But the working of the test cases is little different from a normal execution i think. I'm not able to print the value of the variables.

It's debuggable just as `solc`. I just checked and I can actually inspect variables. The only ones I can't are the "fake" ones that come from destructuring (`optionName` and `inputModes`). Maybe you were trying to inspect these?

This PR has been stale for a while. Maybe take over?

Are you sure you're pushing to the right remote? This is an extrnal PR so you need to add the contributor's fork as a remote first:
```bash
git remote add Midhun07 git@github.com:Midhun07/solidity.git
```
Then you can do `git push Midhun07 fix_invalid_options_mode_combinations --force-with-lease`

By the way I see that you did manage to push here. But something went very wrong because there's a ton of extra commits. Is the branch properly rebased on `develop`? Also make sure it was rebased, not merged. There should be no merge commits.
