# [\#12167 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12167) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Merge all entry points for a target

Previously, for every verification target (an assertion for example), we created N queries where N is the number of entry points (public/external functions + constructor) that could syntactically reach the assertion.
The N queries were very similar, where the only difference was the entry point.
Say we have functions F1, F2 and F3. The 3 queries would be
```
for each F:
    add rule (interface && F && constraints => error) and query for error
```

In the new version we have
```
for each F:
    add rule (interface && F && constraints => error)
query for error
```

Each query is a bit lighter in the previous version, but the queries are very similar so it's a lot of redundancy to keep asking almost the same question.

When we use z3's C++ interface this isn't really a problem because the CHC system is already in memory, and we just add the new rules above one at a time.
However, when we use the smtlib2 interface, the queries are individually dumped, so each smt2 file has a big redundant part. One example is the erc777 openzeppelin contract that I'm verifying:
in the previous version it creates 7 queries of 117MB, whereas in the new version it's one query of 121MB.
The solver before took 11.7 minutes to solve all 7 queries, and now takes 85s to solve the one query.

Just rebased.
@hrkrshnn how about this one?
@blishko already approved it from the CHC side
