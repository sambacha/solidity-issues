# [\#12172 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12172) `merged`: [CI] Store yul-phaser as an artifact

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-21 17:25](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12172):

I noticed that `artifacts_tools` does not include yul-phaser. Not sure we need it as an artifact but the same can probably be said for `solidity-upgrade` so if we have one, we should have both.

Looks like `store_artifacts` supports only single files and whole directories so I had to create separate templates.
