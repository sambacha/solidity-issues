# [\#12174 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12174) `merged`: [CI] Gitter notifications on failure for all nightly and non-PR jobs

~Depends on #12173 (draft until it's merged).~ Merged.

In the past we had some situations where the nightlies were failing and no one noticed because only two jobs post notifications to our Gitter channel. This PR fixes the problem by adding making all jobs used by the nightly workflow post notifications on failure. It also disables success notifications for `t_ems_test_ext_colony` (I think a failure notification is enough here not to spam the channel) but leaves the success notification for that one fuzzer job on so that we can see that notifications still work.

Unfortunately CircleCI does not have any feature that would let us enable/disable the notification job based on workflow. We have to either duplicate jobs or add parameters to every job. The only reasonable solution I found is to always include the notification but then in the notification step check if we're running a scheduled run or a PR check.

#12173 has been merged so this is now reviewable.

Also, I realized that the notifications will go not only for nightlies but also for jobs that run directly on `develop` and `breaking`. I think it's actually a good thing so I added the notify task to all jobs. I hope it won't be too spammy.

The newly added notifications for jobs on `develop` and `breaking` are triggered on failure only right? So, this means that apart from getting notified about nightly success/failure on gitter, we would also be notified on jobs that fail on non PR CIs. What would these be? External tests?

The changes look technically good to me, I am just not sure if the notification load would be too much.

Yes only on failure.

Non-PRs would for example be release runs (when a new tag is pushed) or merging a PR into `develop` and `breaking`. The latter might be a bit spammy if we get breakage on `develop` and that's not uncommon. On the other hand it would be a pretty good motivator to fix it and it's a bit wasteful to have CI run on `develop` but then ignore these runs. Because we ignore them, we often notice breakage on `develop` only indirectly, from side-effects on PRs so this would help us spot it.

Recently I discovered that you can get e-mail notifications for the whole project on CircleCI but you have to explicitly "follow" it. It would be an alternative way to get notified about these runs but I think not many people on the team do it so gitter notifications give breakage much more visibility.

Finally, there's a technical difficulty in discerning failures in scheduled runs from ones on non-PRs. I would probably have to hard-code workflow names in the command, which seems very easy to break. Doing a notification in both cases was just easier to implement.

Well, I'd argue that breakage outside of PRs is meant to be an exception rather than the rule so it shouldn't be a big problem. The biggest downside I see is that if it fails, we're likely to get notifications from multiple jobs. It would be better to get it just once per workflow but there does not seem to be any easy way to achieve this.

Let's try then :)
