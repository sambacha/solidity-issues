Depends on who you ask :) It's a matter of style so any answer you'll get is just an opinion. In any case in this project our convention is to use it in .cpp files.

> Overall the PR needs some more work. In particular it does not yet solve the problem from the issue - the actual size is not included in the message.

@cameel thank you for feedback!
So, the problem is that the tests give an error if I specify the actual size

Here's a warning ->
 
**Expected result:**
```
⠀⠀Warning 5574: (0-27133): Contract code size exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious 
⠀⠀Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low 
⠀⠀"runs" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.
```
**Obtained result:**
```
⠀⠀Warning 5574: (0-27133): Contract code size = 27286 < 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious 
⠀⠀Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low

```

Is that what you meant?

In isoltest.cpp I see boost test, and which tests should I change manually and where? It turns out I will need to make a commit or what? It's just that I haven't worked with CI tests and with ordinary too

Do you have a local build of the compiler and can you run tests locally? If not please take a look at [Contributing](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html) and [Building from source](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source).

Once you have that, you'll find `isoltest` in `build/test/tools/`. It's a program that executes most of our tests case and if you run it with the `--accept-updates` option, it will update error messages in tests automatically. 

We run the same tests in CI on various platforms - these are the `xxx_soltest` jobs you can see on the list in this PR. If it passes for you locally it should generally also pass in CI unless you're doing something that might be platform specific.

The `chk_coding_style` is just a style check. It's currently failing because you have some whitespace at the end of one of the lines (please check the diff). I'd generally recommend to set up your editor to automatically remove trailing whitespace. This makes diffs much easier to read because it prevents you from accidentally leaving small meaningless changes all over the place.

> It turns out I will need to make a commit or what?

Well, you can just amend the existing commit. But yes, please include the changes made by `isoltest` in your commits. Otherwise they won't be seen by our CI.

> In isoltest.cpp I see boost test, and which tests should I change manually and where?

I mentioned boost tests because some messages might also be there but I suspect that just running `isoltest` might be enough here. Please try it and if some tests are still failing after that, we'll see what else need to be updated.

I did everything as it was in the documentation and also executed the command ```isoltest.cpp --accept-updates```, but nothing has been updated

as I understood correctly, all tests are written on ```.sol``` and are located in ```test/libsolidity/syntaxtests/bytecode_too_large.sol```
that is, I can change it without doing any update. I just spent 3 hours sorting out the documentation, first I had an error with truffle, then with Cmake, etc. And I use two IDE Visual Studio 2022 and Clion (in the documentation we used Visual Studio 2019 and later versions and there was nothing written about ```CLion``` and in `CLion` I have infinite Indexing module)


`test/libsolidity/syntaxtests/bytecode_too_large.sol`
```Solidity
contract test {
    function f() public pure returns (string memory ret) {
        // 27000 bytes long data
       ret = "";
    }
}
//
// ====
// EVMVersion: >=spuriousDragon
// ----
// Warning 5574: (0-27133): Contract code size exceeds 24576 bytes (a limit introduced in Spurious Dragon). This contract may not be deployable on mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low "runs" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.
```
That is, we just manually rewrite the Warning to which we need?

Are you sure it's `isoltest` and not `isoltest.cpp`? What happens when you run just `./isoltest` inside `build/test/tools/`?

Not yet because CI checks fail. The expected bytecode size in the message seems to be different than in @hrkrshnn's update. I wonder if it's just a mistake or if the bytecode built locally really ends up having a slightly different size.

Another problem is that not all runs of this test return the same size. The is executed by `soltest_all.sh`, which runs it for several different EVM versions: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/3774955dcc902e870f9fcaa3927fb27015fb2619/.circleci/soltest_all.sh#L31

Looks like in the fourth run the result is different. You need to check which evm version this is and use the `EVMVersion` directive in isoltest to make the test not run on that version: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/3774955dcc902e870f9fcaa3927fb27015fb2619/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/bytecode_too_large.sol#L8

Then also create a copy of the test for that particular version with different expectations so that this version does not go untested.

@DavidRomanovizc Could you please remove / squash the last commits?

About the test update. The issue seems to be that the bytecode size is different for different versions of EVM and perhaps settings as well, as cameel mentioned. If you want, you could try changing `evmVersion >= spuriousDragon` to just `evmVersion = london`. Maybe changing to ` >= constantinopole` might just work (my guess is that the difference comes from the shift opcodes). I can also take a look later today, if it's difficult for you.

@hrkrshnn, I tried to change the evm version, but the tests still failed with some other errors
I still don't understand what the problem lies. 

>Could you please remove / squash the last commits?

when I deleting commit, I get an error:

I think we also have to restrict this to "only one codegen and only without optimizer" or something. Maybe someone from the team can take this over?

Сan you explain in more detail, please, what exactly to restrict?

It is normal that the number of ```bytecode_too_large.sol``` file is _27286_, the program expects _27286_, but for some reason this value changes on the next test? Please can you check the test results ```ci/circleci: t_ubu_release_soltest``` and the file itself
it just didn't pass the only test, and for some reason other inputs were submitted to the input

I have squashed the commits and adjusted tests. I'm not sure if they will pass though. There's something weird going on - locally I get numbers completely different from the ones I've seen in the failing tests. I checked with various EVM versions, with/without `--optimize` and with/without `--abiencoderv1` and I still can't match these numbers. Well, let's see if it passes with the numbers I'm getting locally. If not, then we'll see what else we can do.

> Сan you explain in more detail, please, what exactly to restrict?

We have various directives that can be used in tests. For example one that controls whether the compilation goes through the old or the new code generator (`compileViaYul`). You'd have to have a look through various test files to see what they are.

Honestly, I didn't expect that you'd need them for this task.

> It is normal that the number of `bytecode_too_large.sol` file is 27286, the program expects 27286, but for some reason this value changes on the next test? 

As I said in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12177#issuecomment-950284843, we use `soltest_all.sh` which does multiple test runs with different options. In particular with different EVM versions (and the `EVMVersion` directive in test just decides whether to run the test on that version or skip it) but also with/without optimization and on ABI encoder v1/v2. Changing these can affect the size of produced bytecode because it makes the generator produce slightly different output.

The size should not differ between `t_ubu_release_soltest` and `t_ubu_soltest` though so I think there might be some other factor we're not taking into account,

Looks like in syntax tests we do not remove metadata from bytecode. Metadata contains compiler version and this differs between local builds and CI. I added a commit that disables the metadata in all syntax tests. I'm not sure we want to go that far though.

An alternative solution would be to add a new directive that would let us disable this only in specific tests.

Looks like it passed tests now. Except for the Windows ones but these failures are unrelated - CircleCI seems to be having some problems with Windows VMs right now.

Well, yeah. We discussed the metadata change today and disabling it should be fine so I guess I can merge it as is.
