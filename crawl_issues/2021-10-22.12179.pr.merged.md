Do you need any help with adding/updating these tests?

Sure. Looks like @akali is not working on it so it's fine to take over.

Is there a way to disable tests that require SMT/Horn solver in `test/cmdLineTests.sh`?

It supports the `--no-smt` option just like `soltest`/`isoltest`.
You can also give it a pattern with shell wildcards to run only the tests with matching names.

How do you input the pattern? Here's what I'm trying to run, but it doesn't like the arg format
```
./cmdlineTests.sh ast_compact_json_with_base_path
```

That should work if it's the full name of the test dir. If not, you have to add some wildcards:
```bash
./cmdlineTests.sh "*ast_compact_json_with_base_path*"
```

Looks like you're having a problem with this line:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e0c85c6f58310e61dbc6f153b6228e6240e63f8a/test/cmdlineTests.sh#L57

Are you by chance on macOS? It's probably that `cut` on your platform supports only short options. Replacing `cut --characters` with `cut -c` should fix that. If that works for you, please submit a PR with the change.

This probably slipped though because we never really use this feature in CI - we always run all tests - and locally it worked for me on Linux so I never noticed.

Hi, better if someone else takes it. For tests to pass, it'll be small changes in many dozens of files, hadn't realized it was that broad of a change.

@dallonasnes Test input must be updated, yes, but if you mean test output/expectations, we of course have auto-update mode so it does not have to be done manually. I.e. there's the `--accept-updates` option for `isoltest` and `--update` for `cmdlineTests.sh`.

@cameel, I guess this is not the best way to go. We want to keep pretty JSONs in the test expectations and modify only the test runners, right? Please check a fixup commit I delivered and let me know it is fine.

@wechman Ah, you're right! Looks like we were already pretty-printing by default in all cases so we can actually keep the expectations and just adjust the options. I misremembered that and thought that we needed to update expectation in some cases too but apparently not.

This still needs some tests for the compact version though.

@cameel, I added compact JSON output tests to the fixup commit.  But, I noticed surprising result in ast_pretty_json_with_base_path test.  There is pretty-printed JSON with following first line: "JSON AST (compact format):" in the test output. I am not sure if I the information about "compact format" is required to be part of the output, is it? Unless, I should not mix "--ast-compact-json" with "--pretty-json" in the test scenarios?

The `compact` part in `--ast-compact-json` is not related to pretty-printing. There used to be an option called `--ast-json` and it was removed in #10363. The new format is just a bit more dense. It's unfortunate that it's now easily confused with compact printing.

Maybe we could remove the "compact format" part from the header, though changing the output is technically a breaking change. Personally, I'd just leave it as is, it does correspond to the option name.

Anyway, the output of `--ast-compact-json` should be affected by `--pretty-print` just like the other options.

Yes, it is easy to confuse compact JSON with compact printing.  But, with your explanation, it all makes sense. Thanks for that!

About header, I agree we can keep it as it is now.
