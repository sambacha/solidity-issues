# [\#12181 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12181) `closed`: [CI] Automate preparation of release binaries for publishing (via artifacts)

Closes #9933.
~Depends on #12173 (draft until it's merged).~ Merged.

It's not complete automation of the publishing process as stated in #9933 but it at least takes care of the most tedious and error prone part of the process so I think it's good enough.

The PR adds:
- A script for downloading artifacts representing the binaries we use in releases.
    - Surprisingly there's no command for easy downloading of artifacts inside a CircleCI job and it requires using their API (see [Access uploaded artifact URL in job](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045457592-Access-uploaded-artifact-URL-in-job)). Fortunately I already had a script for doing something similar (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/41) so I repurposed it for this.
- The `c_release_binaries` job that uses the script to gather artifacts from jobs that build release binaries, puts them in two directories (one for github release, one for solc-bin) and names files in each directory according to our naming conventions. Then attaches the results as its own artifacts.
- A step that posts a notification to gitter when it succeeds.
- ~A small fix for missing `*workflow_trigger_on_tags` in some of the existing jobs.~ Merged separately.

The new job is supposed to run only on tagged commits. Note that I can only really test it on a PR. On a tagged commit some things will be different (CircleCI env vars, version string, etc.). We'll have to test that in practice once the PR is merged.

This passed CI. Here's a successful run of [`b_release_binaries`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/19930/workflows/f63cdca9-3ae7-4420-873d-30f4c59eca1c/jobs/880945) and [a message posted to gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=6172efabfb8ca0572bd8bc69) (slightly misformatted because the variable containing tag name is not defined on a PR).

Now I'm removing the temporary commits - the job will only run on tags from now on.

This is now reviewable too.

Answered. Basically, I need to decide which way to go with this and update it one way (workspace) or another (Python-based script).

Closing in favor of #12929.
