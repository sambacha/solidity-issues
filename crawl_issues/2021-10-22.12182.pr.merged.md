# [\#12182 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12182) `merged`: [CI] Reusable command for gitter notifications

This is a simple refactor, extracted into a separate PR because I need it in more than one other PR.

It converts the existing notification step templates into a parameterized and reusable command. This reduces duplication and makes it easier to add new notifications (which is needed in #12181).

@cameel Was this tested by any chance? Looks good. Can approve if this was tested. We can also test in prod :)

Yeah, I think the easiest is to test it in production, as it explicitly excludes PRs. Though of course you could add a test-commit that removes that exception so it runs on PRs as well.

@hrkrshnn I did test it but not very extensively (I didn't want to spam the channel and also the variables are going to be different in non-PR runs anyway so it's not foolproof). I tested it together with #12181. Take a look at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12181#issuecomment-949876968.

@Marenz I did that in #12181 (it was originally a part of that PR) and when it worked I removed the debug commits.
