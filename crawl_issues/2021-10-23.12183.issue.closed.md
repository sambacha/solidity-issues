The following syntax isn't allowed, but it is a very nice feature:
```sol
uint32 x, y;
```
Same thing as:
```sol
uint32 x;
uint32 y;
```
Just more concise. Same thing with this:
```sol
for(uint32 i = subSys.offset, j = i + subSys.count, k = 0; i < j; ++i, ++k)
```
And
```sol
uint32 i = subSys.offset;
uint32 j =  i + subSys.count;
for(uint32 k = 0; i < j; ++i) {

   ++k;
}
```

This feature has already been proposed in #537 (declarations) and #11517 (loops) and rejected.
