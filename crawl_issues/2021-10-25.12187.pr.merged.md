# [\#12187 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12187) `merged`: Run external tests directly on upstream repo where possible

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-25 11:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12187):

In preparation for #10745 I'm updating external tests to run on the latest upstream code.

Where possible this actually switches the tests to use upstream directly rather than our forks. We do not update them very often and @ekpyron in the past mentioned that maintaining forks is not necessarily preferable (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10556#discussion_r540174098). I think that this will give us better feedback though it could also result in more frequent breakage unfortunately.

- OpenZeppelin: already on 0.8.x. Can be used directly.
- ENS: Can be used directly.
- Colony: still on 0.7.x. Requires changes from our fork. I rebased them on the latest `develop` though ([updated `develop_080` branch](https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/colonyNetwork/tree/develop_080)).
- Gnosis: looks like v2 is now the main branch and also it has been upgraded to 0.7.x. They switched from Truffle to Hardhat though so the update will be a bit more complex. I'll do it in a separate PR.

This should now pass all tests and is ready for review.

Looks like [Colony external tests actually fail](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20015/workflows/b4999e7a-3843-4e9f-a6c9-31e891c5162e/jobs/884228), though it's not visible here because we only run them nightly. They run out of gas during a migration. The limit is by default at ~6 mln but even increasing that to 100 mln does not help.

I'm going to revert the `develop_080` branch to the previous position and work on a fix separately.

In any case, this does not really affect this PR because it contains no Colony-related changes. They were only in our forked repos.
