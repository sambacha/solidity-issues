# [\#12190 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12190) `merged`: Add missing condition to `gitter_notify` command

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-26 08:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12190):

This fixes a small bug introduced in #12182. I did test it but only really to check that notifications appear. Turns out I did not notice that the condition that ensures that notification only shows up on success/failure was missing from the command. This PR adds it.

Without the fix, [notifications from nightly jobs are sent unconditionally](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=61774bbc29ddcd029343d9fe). I tested the fix in 3 scenarios:
- [Successful `b_docs` job with `on_fail` condition](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20000/workflows/467d1abc-5de5-4f35-a9ba-24509f422c29/jobs/883571). No notification.
- [Successful `b_docs` job with `on_success` condition](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20002/workflows/0297c180-e81a-4ee7-9d5f-46ebb31ab087/jobs/883618). A [success notification](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=6177c100d78911028afefa6f) was sent.
- [Failed `b_docs` job with `on_fail` condition](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20003/workflows/e57ea098-692c-4986-9341-265ff3989fb8/jobs/883638). A [failure notification](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=6177c100d78911028afefa6f) was sent.
