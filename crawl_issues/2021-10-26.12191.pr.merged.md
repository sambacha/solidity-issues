# [\#12191 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12191) `merged`: Make external test scripts more flexible

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-26 10:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12191):

Another refactor in preparation for fixing #10745.
~Depends on #12173 (draft until that PR is merged).~ Merged.
Depends on #12259.

Currently the external test scripts are all made with Truffle in mind and are a bit hard to customize both if they need some special steps and when they use a different framework. This PR "unrolls" the top-level functions and puts their content directly in each test script so that it can be adjusted more easily. It also does small general refactors:
- Adds `set -e` to the scripts so that failures interrupt them.
- Changes arguments of some functions or adds defaults so that the calls are a bit less verbose.
- Removes some global variables in favor of locals+parameters.

Added two more commits from work on Gnosis external tests. Now the scripts just neutralize any `prepublish`/`prepare` hooks instead of doing gymnastics to make `npm install` succeed trying to compile contracts. As a nice side effect this should make them slightly faster - less stuff need to be repeated twice.

This now depends on #12173. The PRs themselves are completely independent but I have another PR (#12214) that needs both.

#12173 has been merged so this is now reviewable.

I think the `set -e` and function syntax change could be just merged separately, as is, as that doesn't require a lot of review.

Reviewed most of it, except the two major commits (fda1ab5ce1af068d308d62478d0da47b6f1694db and be6a85be14fb9fd644eafe1b8f90649b7ce8be69) which require more thorough look.

Extracted the minor refactors into a separate PR: #12259. This PR now depends on it.
