Do we still need this PR after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12187?
Why is this PR needed?

Yeah, it's still relevant. It's a separate thing. The issue is that OZ has hardhat config but we're trying (and unfortunately succeeding) to run truffle - which then executes tests with the wrong binary.

The URL change overlaps with #12187 and this PR could really be on top of it but I'm trying to reduce long dependency chains between PRs as much as possible so they can be reviewed independently.

I need the URL change in both because I'm not sure if the HH version used in our external fork already supports using a custom binary (most likely not). The upstream one definitely does.

Dependencies merged. This is now ready for review.
