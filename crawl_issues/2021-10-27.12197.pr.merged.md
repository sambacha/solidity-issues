This adds an external test run for [trident](https://github.com/sushiswap/trident).

Unfortunately there is a problem: it uses mixed Solidity versions. `contracts/flat/BentoBoxV1Flat.sol` wants 0.6.12 and requires some minor changes to compile on 0.8.9 (some conversions and constructor visibility. We need a workaround for that or an upstream PR to make the contracts compatible with both versions.

- Switched this to a fork with fixed conversions: [solidity-external-tests/trident, branch `master_080`](https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/trident/tree/master_080). If this works I will submit it as a PR to sushiswap.
- Had to add workaround for other 0.6.12 contracts present in `node_modules/`. Fortunately they seem unsued.
- Now I can run tests but many fail with `ProviderError: Must be authenticated!`. I think I need to find a way to run only the subset that does not require an external node.

This now works, though not without workarounds:
- Still on our fork until my 0.8.x compatibility fixes are merged upstream (https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/pull/282).
- Some tests fail and had to be disabled (https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/issues/283).
- Can't force latest hardhat because tests only pass with the exact dependency versions from `yarn.lock` (https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/issues/284).

Since #12195 has the unresolved issue with Hardhat tests failing due to the changes in the extcodesize check, I swapped it with this PR so that it can go in first. Now this one is directly on top of  #12192 and #12195 is on top of this PR.

This is now reviewable. The workarounds are unfortunately still there but they're not that bad and we can remove them once stuff gets fixed upstream.

I got no feedback in https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/pull/282 so far so it looks like it might not get merged in the near future. I adjusted the test script to solve the problem by patching upstream repo. This way we can track project's `master` branch and not rely on our fork that needs to be manually updated.
