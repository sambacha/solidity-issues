**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Fixes #8557.
~Depends on #12192 (draft until that PR is merged).~ Merged.

[ens-contracts](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts) seems to be the new consolidated repo for all ENS contracts. The project uses Hardhat now and is compatible with Solidity >= 0.8.4.

The test also now uses the upstream directly rather than our fork in solidity-external-tests.

This requires a bit more work. I got Hardhat to compile the project with the custom compiler but `@ensdomains` in `node_modules/` still gets compiled using 0.8.4 (even though I'm replacing all the copies of `solc-js` installed by npm).

Is this needed after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12187 ?

Yes. Both update the repo URL but #12187 is just a trivial switch from our fork to the upstream (which just works, without any other changes needed so it can be merged right away) while this PR switches to a different repo and requires more work. Also depends on other PRs. ENS has moved all of their contracts into a single repo one and switched from Truffle to Hardhat.

I still need to fix one problem here - some dependency is being compiled with older solc, triggering our compiler version check.

This is now reviewable.

Ready for another round or review.

lint of solcjs is failing though.

Failing job was unrelated, fixed in #12446. I just rebased to make tests pass.

Fair enough. I'd be inclined to just track their `master` and see how often it breaks. We can always switch to a fork if it happens too often.

Tracking a specific commit will require some slight adjustments because it cannot be done after `git clone --depth 1`. Would be best if all of these projects had sensible tags but the ones where they would be most helpful are ones that are missing them :)

Also, ENS is not the only project having this problem. Trident is also developing quite rapidly.
