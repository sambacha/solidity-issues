I don't understand - why do we need a new "stop after" setting? I thought the idea would be to just fill the absolute path during parsing and before actually trying to load the file?

The ticket specified 

> Either perform import resolution earlier so that absolutePath is already in the AST when stopAfter: parsing is used or introduce a new value for stopAfter (parsingAndImportResolution?) that still stops before analysis but after import resolution.

and I figured we have that internal step already so just exposing it would be the easiest solution.. and I figured it makes sense to expose more steps as necessary..

I think that, unless it is complicated to do, we should expose more useful data earlier.
