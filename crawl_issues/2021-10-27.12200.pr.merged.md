I did all the work, wanting to add a variation (parsingAndImporting) and when I was almost done I noticed that there are no imports in the ASTJSON tests because they are individual .sol files, not .json inputs.
But the work was almost done and the result is a nicer class, so I am submiting this now :)

This only needs minor tweaks so I just added them myself and pushed to the branch to avoid another round of review. With that I can approve it already.

All changes are in fixups. Please squash if you think they're fine and I'll reapprove.
