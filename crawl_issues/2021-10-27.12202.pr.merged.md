# [\#12202 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12202) `merged`: Merge `develop` into `breaking`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-27 13:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12202):

The main reason for updating the branch is that I want to see if the `t_ems_ext_hardhat` job added in #12165 will pass on `breaking` too.

Oh! The use-after-free is in develop?? I'll fix it right away.

CI seems to be failing for the same reason as the last time (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11840#issuecomment-905397202).

Last time I reported it to CircleCI and this is how I described the situation (after some back and forth to provide more details):

> The scheduled [`t_ubu_ossfuzz` (816229)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/18304/workflows/ddb3703f-edf3-40f0-bac6-bd02cd364dac/jobs/816229) finished at 1:45 UTC but then there was another run ~5h later and you can see in the header that it was not a scheduled one: [`t_ubu_ossfuzz` (816230)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/18304/workflows/ddb3703f-edf3-40f0-bac6-bd02cd364dac/jobs/816230). The workflow page only links to the earlier one.

> So it looks like there was some glitch that associated the nightly run with the PR. The PR was different from usual PRs in that it was not associated with a short-lived feature branch. It was instead merging the main branch (`develop`) into another long-lived branch (`breaking`). Scheduled nightly workflows also run on `develop` so there might be some connection here.

The main part of the response I got was this:

> I'm passing on this information to the team actively working on the issue, as mentioned by my colleague Aaron.
> For now I'm putting this ticket on hold until we get an update from our software engineers regarding the implementation of a fix.
> There's no need to reply right now. You will be notified automatically when the status of your issue is updated by CircleCI.

I haven't heard anything on the issue since then. Apparently the bug is still present. If my assessment is correct then a workaround is to simply merge something into `develop`. It will rerun the CI with correct jobs.

Yeah. It's not the first time this happens - some jobs that run outside of PRs have no notifications so we usually don't notice. I have a PR that adds notifications to them: #12174.

Looks like [`t_ems_ext_hardhat`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20064/workflows/ae0d35b1-9f38-44af-88ea-104877a9156f/jobs/886394) passed.

EDIT: Ah, wait. That's on develop. The job will run on `breaking` only after this PR is merged.

The Hardhat test [finally ran on `breaking`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20076/workflows/eb53d46f-72a9-4f5f-b58c-d651efd0bcc1/jobs/886961) and passed.

The [workflow](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20076/workflows/eb53d46f-72a9-4f5f-b58c-d651efd0bcc1) as a whole did not pass though. There's some unrelated breakage.

I just got a notification from CircleCI that the issue from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12202#issuecomment-952950518 has been fixed. So, hopefully, no more `nightly` workflow running on `develop` :)
