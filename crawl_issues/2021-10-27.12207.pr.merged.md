# [\#12207 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12207) `merged`: Fix defaults for `--enforce-gas-cost` in isoltest

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-27 16:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12207):

While working on #12177 I noticed that `isoltest` is broken with EVM versions other than the latest. This is because it has a bug which always enables gas cost enforcement in tests and we support that only on the latest EVM. If you try older EVM, you get a validation error. This does not affect `soltest` (it does not enable gas enforcement automatically) so it went unnoticed until now.

Also, `--abiencoderv1` conflicts with gas enforcement too. The PR fixes that by enabling gas enforcement automatically only if this option is not used.
