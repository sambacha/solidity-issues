## Description

[segfault.zip](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/files/7428026/segfault.zip)

The attached contract produces:

```
../build/solc/solc segfault.sol
Segmentation fault
```

when compiled with solc

On master, using AFL fuzzing.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.8.10-develop.2021.10.27+commit.7ebf71f3.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04 in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

Thanks for the report!

Simpler repro:
``` bash
{
    printf '// SPDX-License-Identifier: '
    for i in {1..29069}; do
        printf x
    done
} | solc -
```

This started happening on 0.8.8. The original repro has some special chars in it and a contract but the bug seems to be specifically in the SPDX comment parsing and a very long comment is enough to trigger it. In GDB I get an enormous stack trace that just keeps printing. It's somewhere in the C++ regex library. I think it recurses too deeply. Probably the pattern we use is not very efficient and backtracks too much.

For me it starts crashing at exactly 29069 `x` chars in the comment. I suspect that on different machines the exact limit might be different.

Nice bug ;)

If it's really the regex *implementation*, we can consider actually pulling in and moving to https://compile-time-regular-expressions.readthedocs.io/ :-). That way we could also speed up the regex patterns in the yul optimizer (during name cleanup)...

I rather suspect [catastrophic backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html). If that's the case then it's the regex itself that's the problem and using a more efficient implementation will only make it require larger input to crash :)

We might switch to a non-backtracking engine (if there's on available) but these typically support a more limited syntax.

This issue was used to create a [Solidity compiler bug bounty](https://www.reddit.com/r/solidity/comments/1fczopw/bug_buster_to_upgrade_its_solidity_compiler/) that looks for new segfault errors on v0.8.27.
