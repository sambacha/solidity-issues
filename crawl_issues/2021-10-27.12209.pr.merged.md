# [\#12209 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12209) `merged`: Update expectations in tests for inline assembly with name clashes on `breaking`

On `breaking` inline assembly with name clashes is disallowed so the tests added in #12139 cause syntax errors.

This PR replaces command-line/semantic tests with syntax tests and updates their expectations.

There seems to be a problem with Windows VMs on CircleCI.
