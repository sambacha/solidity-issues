# [\#12210 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12210) `closed`: A slight difference in gas when deploying smart contracts

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36286293?u=f306f15a88c782c6c2ac589bed04f9844e6f4e2c&v=4" width="50">[hpumengzhao](https://github.com/hpumengzhao) opened issue at [2021-10-28 01:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12210):

When I deploy the smart contract below, the gas is 99621(On the remix, the version of the compiler is 0.8.9, with optimization-runs=200).
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SC1{
    uint[100] a;
    function test(uint x)  public returns(uint){
        return a[1]+x;
    }   
}
```
After I changed it to:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SC1{
    uint[100] a;
    function test(uint x)  public returns(uint){
        return x+a[1];
    }   
}
```
the gas at deployment is 99405.

After comparing their assembly code, I found that it was because of the different order in which the expression parameters were put on the stack.

In the same way, I tried the following two smart contractsï¼š
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SC1{
    uint[100] a;
    function test()  public returns(uint){
        return a[1]+a[2]*a[3];
    }   
}
```
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract SC2{
    uint[100] a;
    function test()  public returns(uint){
        return a[2]*a[3]+a[1];
    }   
}
```
The result is that the deployment gas cost of SC1 is 216 less than the deployment gas cost of SC2.

I am very curious what are the rules for converting expressions into assembly code.

I would be very grateful if anyone can answer my confusion:)!
