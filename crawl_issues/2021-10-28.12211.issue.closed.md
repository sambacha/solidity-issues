# [\#12211 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12211) `closed`: Why is struct_copy.sol so badly optimized?

Most of the `mstore` calls in https://gist.github.com/chriseth/05075e7706c8ea3f1ac628a28be486f7 are redundant and also the `keccak` call should only be evaluated once. Why does it perform so badly?

The example here is
```
    mstore(_1, var_k)
    mstore(0x20, _1)
    sstore(keccak256(_1, 0x40), 0x01)
    mstore(_1, var_k)
    mstore(0x20, _1)
```

The optimizer performs so badly because the redundant store eliminator ( #11352 ) only removes stores if they are not read from. What is needed here is removing stores that store the same data that is already present at that location.

The `mstores` are removed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12272 so this is nice, but we still need to replace the keccak calls to a stored local variable, i.e.
```
let x := keccak256(a, b)
let y := mload(c)
let y := keccak256(a, b)
```
should be optimized to
```
let x := keccak256(a, b)
let y := mload(c)
let y := x
```

After the recently introduced optimizer steps, is it now good enough? Or is there more easy work we can do on that?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
