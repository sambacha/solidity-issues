# [\#12215 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12215) `merged`: [CI] Optimize CI resource usage

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-10-28 23:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12215):

Fixes #11670.
~Depends on #12214 (draft until that PR is merged).~ Merged.

This PR applies my conclusions from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11670#issuecomment-954297346.

Also removes compilation-only runs for some external tests (we have them only because they're supposed to be much faster than a full test run but in some cases they actually aren't).

Suprisingly, the results do not align completely with what I have seen in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11670#issuecomment-954297346. In some cases here a `large` machine does increase running time significantly compared to `xlarge`. Maybe in some cases the processes are actually blocked on I/O often and having more of them would help? I originally used `MAKEFLAGS=-j10` on `large` in my tests and maybe this made the difference. I need to investigate that.

EDIT: Added timing from runs I did later:
- (2) run after a rebase.
- (3) run after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12215#issuecomment-962039720
- (4) adjusted thread numbers: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12215#issuecomment-962178656

As for how it affects our credit usage - unfortunately it's hard to say before we merge it. CircleCI does not show the cost per workflow so we'll only see the overall impact on the [Insights page](https://app.circleci.com/insights/github/ethereum/solidity/workflows/main) once this runs for a day or two.

Run 3:
- `small` seems to be not enough for `t_ems_test_ext_zeppelin` because it crashed in the second run. Changing to `medium`.
- I'm doubling the number of threads for `b_ubu_clang`, `b_ubu_cxx20`, `b_ubu_static` and `b_ems` without switching to a larger resource class. Let's see if there are some unused CPU cycles after all.

Doubling the number of threads indeed helped. For `b_ubu_static` that does not fit in memory though. I did another run with modified numbers.

Run 4:
- `b_ubu_clang`: 2 more threads
- `b_ubu_cxx20`: 2 more threads
- `b_ubu_static`: 1 less thread to prevent it running out of memory
- `t_ems_test_ext_zeppelin`: increased resource class to `large`

The result is that the 2 extra threads do not seem to be doing anything but 1 less for `b_ubu_static` does prevent the crash. `t_ems_test_ext_zeppelin` did complete faster but that might be just normal variance.

Table updated with new numbers.

#12214 has been merged so this is now reviewable.

This PR removes three jobs that are marked as required: `t_ems_compile_ext_gnosis_v2`, `t_ems_compile_ext_zeppelin`, `t_ems_compile_ext_ens`. They need to be removed from the repo settings as well before we can merge it.
