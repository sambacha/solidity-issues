# [\#12217 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12217) `closed`: call(encodeWithSelector) is too expensive
**Labels**: `optimizer`

the construct
```solidity
address(target).call(encodeWithSelector(Target.myMethod.selector));
```

Should be equivalent to:
```solidity
target.myMethod();
```

However, it is far more expensive - ~400 gas more.
(the actual waste is even larger, considering that normal call performs check of the address before the call, and checks for revert afterwards, while address.call does no extra checks)

The difference is even larger if parameters are also encoded.

following is a sample code to test in remix

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only
pragma solidity ^0.8;

contract TestCall {
    Z atest = new Z();

    //takes 26302 gas
    function runNormal() external {
        atest.test();
    }
    
    // takes 26676 gas
    function runWithCall() external {
        address(atest).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(Z.test.selector));
    }
}

contract Z {
    function test() external {
       emit Debug(msg.data);
    }   
    event Debug(bytes data);
}
```

I think the overhead is because of extra memory copies.

probably. but the question why there are those extra memory copies?

The Solidity optimizer currently does not have a concept of lifetime of memory objects. Because of that, the `bytes` created in `abi.encodeWithSelector(Z.test.selector)` is persistently allocated while in `atest.test();` is it allocated only temporarily.

I'm closing this since we are very aware of this optimization opportunity.
