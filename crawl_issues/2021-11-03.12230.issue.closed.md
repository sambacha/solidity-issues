#12074 added support for CLI output options (like `--bin` or `--ewasm`) in assembler mode. If no outputs are requested though, the compiler chooses the default ones to keep the behavior backwards-compatible. We should change this so that nothing is printed by default (this is how the compiler mode behaves) but it needs to be done in a breaking release.

This was done in #12370.
