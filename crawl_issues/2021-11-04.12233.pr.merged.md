In preparation of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11689

Emscripten 2.0.32 will raise warnings on this which are treated as error by us (see https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/ChangeLog.md):
- Emscripten will now warn when linker-only flags are specified in compile-only (-c) mode. Just like with clang itself, this warning can be disabled using the flag: -Wno-unused-command-line-argument.

Will need to look at the soljson.js CI artifact to confirm that the options are correctly honoured and work using ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS``.

The resulting ``soljson.js`` does contain base64-encoded wasm, which means the options do get through correctly.

As for the set of options: those are exactly the options that a build with emscripten 2.0.33 complained about.

For the record: the options are documented in https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/settings.js

Damn it, now I had to rebase due to a Changelog conflict due to the entry in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12236 (which was probably superfluous anyways) :-)... Can I trouble you guys for one more re-approval :-)?
