The hack is no longer needed due to https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/470, right?

Might be worth making an announcement about this. Some tools and frameworks may be still using old solc-js because it generally works and they download the binaries on their own. That was the case with Truffle until very recently. See https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/4134. They've been on 0.6.0 and even now [they're only on 0.6.9](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/blob/92c195085c843130e561e682d754679c3078df26/packages/compile-solidity/package.json#L36) which is just barely enough to avoid this problem.

I see that [Waffle is still on 0.6.3](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/blob/master/waffle-compiler/package.json#L49) so we should give them a heads up - might be a good idea to submit an issue in their repo.

We discussed it on the chat and started wondering what versions are used in general. Here's the list I compiled. Reposting it here so that it's easier to find and reference later:

- Waffle - 0.6.3
- Hardhat - [0.7.3](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/633b8bf1b0e866553b23641adfcdb740a39399a2/packages/hardhat-core/package.json#L134)

- ethers.js: [0.7.1](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/b1458989761c11bf626591706aa4ce98dae2d6a9/package.json#L100)
- embark: [0.6.1](https://github.com/embarklabs/embark/blob/c7a5c4c36880dd254917e9a1060788ed7763f943/packages/plugins/solidity/package.json#L58)
- [saddle](https://github.com/compound-finance/saddle): does not seem to have a specific dependency in `package.json`
- [crytic](https://github.com/crytic/crytic-compile): written in Python, probably uses native binaries.
