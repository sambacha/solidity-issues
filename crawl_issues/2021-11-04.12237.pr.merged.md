Fixes #12237.

Just throwing this out there, s.t. we hopefully finally get rid of this script eventually.
We may want to extend the documentation a bit - however, actually all required information is in there already, so maybe it's just fine and we can revisit, if we notice people complaining about not being able to setup a build?

An option would be to add subsections with the concrete commands to install the dependencies for a selected set of distributions (e.g. debian, ubuntu, redhat, archlinux, osx) to subsections in the docs - that's still better than asking users to run an opaque and unmaintained script...

This fixes #12237.

I wonder if github will close it if I add it to the description now?

Apparently it won't.
