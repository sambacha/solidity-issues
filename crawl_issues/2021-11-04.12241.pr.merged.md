Looks good to me and checks passed. Are we merging it?

@cameel The process is usually:
- Open a draft with this to build a docker image - that worked here, but the test runs here still use the old docker image - so the docker build itself performed one build of soljson.js, but no tests and the other CI test runs do not yet use it.
- Open a second PR that updates the hash of the docker image to the one posted by the bot. I'm about to do that :-). The CI runs in *that* PR then accurately judge the change.
- If CI passes in the second PR, merge both.

So bear with me ;-).

Ah, ok, I know the process. I just thought there was something more holding it back. Like an unsolved problem or something.

No, I was just in a call when the build passed :-).
