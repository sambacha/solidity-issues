This looks almost too smooth, but I guess the main issue was figuring out the required change to the install directories for the dependencies in the docker image build.

Binary size increases slightly, but not significantly, so seems ok.
I was hoping that this change would fix the issue that node is slow to exit after loading soljson.js - but it seems to have no effect.

Ah, no, I was comparing the size with the last release, not ``develop`` - in fact the size *decreases* slightly - but negligible anyways.

Nope, why would it :-)?
