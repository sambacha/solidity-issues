I commented that we might need ``decay_t`` to make this work for lvalue references to callable objects as ``_visitor``, thinking that the member of ``detail::ForEach`` couldn't be a reference - but actually, thinking through lifetimes, it *should* be a reference in this case and the current version with ``decay_t`` would needlessly copy.

Not that it matters too much - in all likelyhood it will always be a lambda passed by value anyways, but still :-).

Or well, one might e.g. try to pass a reference to the same mutable generic lambda to ``forEach<Assignment const>`` and ``forEach<VariableDeclaration const>`` and would get into trouble, since the lambda closure would be copied and not passed by reference... so better to fix.

And actually, we can *always* use a reference and don't need to forward: no matter what you pass into ``forEach``, it will live through the entire lifetime of the body of ``forEach``, so no need to ever copy or move it anywhere, but we can just keep it there and reference it.

I tested it and this way it works with zero-copy and zero-move no matter what you pass to it.

Yeah, looking at the result after a few simplifications, I must say my original version was overcomplicated and a bit convoluted :-). The result in this PR is much cleaner and simpler and will be functionally equivalent, respectively, actually even superior.
