# [\#12245 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12245) `closed`: Strengthen natspec parsing
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`, `natspec`

```
/// what @custom:tag test
contract C {
}
```

This is parsed as `@custom:tag` = `test`, and the `what` is ignored entirely (does not show up as `@notice`/`@dev`).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
