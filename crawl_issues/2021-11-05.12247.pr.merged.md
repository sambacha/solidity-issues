# [\#12247 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12247) `merged`: Remove more outdated install_deps scripts.

``scripts/install_deps.ps1`` we do need in CI, but the fact that these other two pull in a rather old boost version seems to indicate that we don't maintain them either, so I'd remove them as well...

I'm not sure what's the state of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11940 and if the (apparently forever broken) snap builds even actually use ``snap/snapcraft.yaml``, so I'd tend to remove that as well actually...

Following https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9582#issuecomment-962062026 I'm also removing ``install_static_z3.sh`` - it's outdated as well.
