# [\#12248 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12248) `closed`: use _library_ integer constants as fixed-length array sizes
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

## Description

Integer constants can't be used as the sizes of fixed-length arrays, _even_ when they come from libraries.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.9
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): london
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): remix, hardhat, etc.
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce
`A.sol`:
```solidity
library A {
    uint256 constant N = 42;
}
```
`B.sol`:
```solidity
import './A.sol';

contract B {
    uint256[A.N] b;
}
```
leads to
```
TypeError: Invalid array length, expected integer literal or constant expression.
  --> contracts/B.sol:12:13:
   |
12 |         uint256[A.N] b;
   |                 ^^^

-->
```
somewhat related original issue, about constants in the _same_ file, now fixed: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/716
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1290 is _not_ the same issue; it's about grabbing constants from other contracts which are _not_ libraries. but the workaround suggested there also works here.

I think fixed size array expect compile time constant , but here A.N will be evaluated at runtime .

A workaround for now would be to move the constant to file level.

This issue could have a duplicate somewhere by the way.

i looked carefully and didn't find one.

interesting, this move hadn't occurred to me. thanks. feel free to close if you want (though of course i think the "issue" is still open).

@chriseth 

For `a.sol`

```solidity
uint constant a = 0x12345678;
```

`b.sol`

```solidity
import "./a.sol";

contract Hello {
    uint[a] x;
}
```

is OK, but `c.sol`

```solidity
import * as X from "./a.sol";

contract Hello {
    uint[X.a] x;
}
```

outputs `Error: Invalid array length, expected integer literal or constant expression.`.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Hey, guys! I faced the same problem with compiler version 0.8.23. Do you plan to add support for setting array length using a constant from the library?
The workaround mentioned above didn't work for me.

My simplified case:
```solidity
library MyLib {
    uint256  internal  constant ARR_LENGTH =  5;
    function getArray()  internal  pure  returns(uint256[ARR_LENGTH] memory arr) {
        return arr;
    }
} 

contract MyContract {
    function useArrayFromLib()  external  {
        uint256[MyLib.ARR_LENGTH] memory arr = MyLib.getArray();
    }
}
```
