There is the `test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp` file, which contains a lot of semantic tests.  It is a large monolithic single C++ file, which takes a long time to compile and is hard to maintain.

We want to move as many test cases out to individual files under `test/libsolidity/semanticTests`.  They should be grouped logically, by following the grouping in SolidityEndToEnd.

Have a look at existing test case in both places to see how they operate.

(This was previously designed/discussed in #3486, but creating a new issue to be more helpful.)

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
