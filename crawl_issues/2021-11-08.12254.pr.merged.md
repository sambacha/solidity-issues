# [\#12254 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12254) `merged`: Remove incorrect outer block from for loop init rewriter documentation.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2021-11-08 10:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12254):

As we realized in private correspondence with @acoglio, the documentation incorrectly suggests that ``ForLoopInitRewriter`` introduces an additional scope.

There is no need to restate that without such a scope this relies on the ``Disambiguator``, since we already document that all steps depend on it.
