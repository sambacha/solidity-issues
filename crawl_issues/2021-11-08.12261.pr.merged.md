Obvious part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12260.

Not entirely sure about ``msg.data`` and ``calldataload``/``calldatasize``, so I'll keep them as is for now and the issue open.

Didn't you just update the documentation towards this end in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12256 ;-)? This just actually does what that one said... although maybe I missed an explicit mention of this being pure somewhere...

Yeah, we don't list the opcodes, but shouldn't we at least list those that are not totally clear? Especially since going from "immutables" to "codecopy" is a (albeit small) mental step.
