# [\#12262 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12262) `merged`: Keep canonical form of Yul during optimization.

I'm not entirely happy with this, but throwing it out for discussion.
I think keeping the form at ``{ { I... } F... }`` is the least hassle - apart from the ``BlockFlattener`` basically everything can stay the same.

The only issue is that ``removeEmptyBlocks`` removes the ``{ I... }`` block, if its empty, and since it's run on various nested blocks, it can't distinguish the outermost one from others that easily... the PR just runs the function grouper again, whenever a step uses ``removeEmptyBlocks`` - not sure about that, though.

We could also relax the canonical form to allow ``{ F... }`` instead of forcing ``{ {} F... }``... However, that would mean minor adjustments for everything that consumes the form.
