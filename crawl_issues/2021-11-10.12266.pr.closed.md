About your question from the call: you need to update test expectations (`isoltest` can do it automatically), which will remove the error from some tests but after doing that please make sure that every test still makes sense. If stopping early makes it ineffective at testing what it was supposed to (i.e. it should produce a specific error message that no longer shows up), it may have to be adjusted.
