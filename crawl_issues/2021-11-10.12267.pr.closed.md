I'd recommend not submitting PRs from `develop` in your fork. It makes it harder to pull changes from the main repo and you can't use it for more than one PR at a time anyway.

I think that the `"File outside of allowed directories."` and `"Not a valid file."` should print the canonical path too. For allowed directories we could list them as well.

> Merge branch 'develop' of https://github.com/joshuatarkwski/solidity into develop

Just a note on our PR workflow: [we're generally using a rebase workflow](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#workflow-for-pull-requests). Instead of merging `develop` into your branch, please rebase it on `develop` instead.
