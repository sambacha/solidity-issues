We do not allow any operator on user defined value types, but `delete` is special: It is implicitly used when we remove an array element and variables of user-defined value type have a default value - so
```
delete x; // x is of type Type
```
is essentially equivalent to
```
Type y;
x = y;
```
which means we already implicitly use it and it would be confusing to allow re-defining delete to something else.

@cameel sees no reason not to allow it.

It's worth noting that it already works on UDVTs when they're a part of an array or a struct. It's only directly deleting them that is not allowed.

Also, this seems simple enough that I think we should consider making it a `good first issue`.
