Solves the second part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12211

This is essentially a common subexpression eliminator, but for non-movable functions. Maybe we can extend this in some more generic way? Of course the idea here is also that we have specialized knowledge about which mstore opcode destroys which keccak call.

Is the only side-effect of keccak that it writes to some scratch space in memory during computation? Do we have other builtins that are almost "side-effect free but not quite" this way? If so, we could maybe generalize it to all of them.

No, keccak only reads from memory. Keccak is side-effect free, but its value depends on the memory contents.

Will rebase this.

So is this just waiting for review?

Replacing ``stale`` by ``takeover`` for now here, let's see if that helps.

The code
```
struct S { uint8 a; uint8 b; }
contract C {
    S s;
    function f(S calldata _s) external { s = _s; }
}
```
causes
```
Unknown exception during compilation: Dynamic exception type: std::out_of_range
std::exception::what: vector
```
on emscripten (with optimizer).

Fund the bug. Reference tracking would have saved me 2 hours. ;)

Also wouldn't hurt to add a bit of fuzzing here...

I see the internal optimiser docs about the data flow analyzer are vague enough, s.t. not mentioning this, doesn't make things any worse - we could improve them eventually, but don't need to bother with it here.
