Can you summarize the change? Do we at least compare the data in storage at the end?

- Storage is compared as before (no changes there).
- Memory changes are not recorded if the flag added in this PR is set (disableMemoryTracing = true)
- Memory dumps are not compared if the flag added in this PR is set (disableMemoryTracing = true)

@bshastry How is that done? I have a feeling that might not be enough for something like

```solidity
{
    let x := calldataload(0)
    let y := sload(x)
    // both of these can be removed
    sstore(x, y)
    sstore(x, y)

    let a := x
    let b := mload(a)
    // both of these can be removed
    mstore(a, b)
    mstore(a, b)
}
// ----
// step: equalStoreEliminator
//
// {
//     let x := calldataload(0)
//     let y := sload(x)
//     let a := x
//     let b := mload(a)
// }
```

Essentially the following

- sstore(a, b): an entry in map is created but not an instruction trace `SSTORE(a, b)`
- mstore(a, b) is neither recorded in state nor trace

Since storage writes are always preserved in map, they may be compared pre/post optimisation. OTOH, memory may not be compared.

Could be merged like this.
