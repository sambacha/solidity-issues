This is not the right place to report scam contracts. Not sure if one exists really - there's no central authority on Ethereum that could just block malicious contracts. This repository is for the Solidity compiler, and the compiler is just a tool and does not have any control over which contracts get deployed to the blockchain. Even if it had, it's not its job to police smart contracts.
