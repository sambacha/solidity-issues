# [\#12282 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12282) `merged`: Fix gas cost enforcement for constructors and make `--enforce-gas-cost-min-value` actually work

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-11-15 15:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12282):

Fixes #12225.
Fixes #11600.

There were two problems in `SemanticTest`:
- In case of a constructor call, the cause of failure was determined correctly (`m_gasCostFailure = true`) but the whole test was not marked as failed (`success = false`).
- The `--enforce-gas-cost-min-value` check was incorrectly bundled with another check meant prevent `ir` cost from being added to the expectations if it was not there originally. As a result it was enforced only if the cost it was checking was not yet listed in the file.

The PR also includes two tiny refactors - renaming a file with a typo and renaming `m_gas` in `ExecutionFramework` to make it clear how it differs from `m_gasUsed` (it's the gas available at the beginning of the transaction).
