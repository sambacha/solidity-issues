# [\#12283 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12283) `merged`: Graceful error handling in soltest/isoltest + improved soltestAssert()
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Fixes #11917.

While working on #12282 I hit an assertion in `ByteUtils` but it looked like something completely different. That's because `soltestAssert()` throws `std::runtime_error` rather than some special exception type reserved for assertions. I also noticed that in #12019 I did not cover `soltestAssert()`. This PR refactors the macro to be in line with `solAssert()`, i.e. allow skipping the message, provide a default message and use a dedicated exception type.

I have also added exception handlers that intercept normal errors (like command-line validation errors) and print them in a way that does not make you think you hit a bug.

Also, `--help` no longer returns an error code. It's normal and expected behavior. A similar change was made for `solc` in #12118.

I recommend reviewing with the option to ignore whitespace changes enabled - changes are actually small but some blocks had to be reindented due to the added `try`/`catch`.

Just needs a rebase (and another look from @christianparpart :)). Otherwise it should be fine.
