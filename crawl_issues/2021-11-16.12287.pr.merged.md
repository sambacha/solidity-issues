Does this need a change in ViewPureChecker.cpp?

Can you add a test for `return abi.encodeCall(this.f, [1, 2]);` I.e. check that it only accepts tuples and not inline arrays?

Can you also add a test with a function pointer stored in a local variable and one stored in storage?

This is currently failing as there is a problem with the extraction of the selector in the code gen when it's a function pointer. I am working on it

Please add a test that uses `abi.encodeCall` together with `address.call` and use some more complex types (structs with dynamically-sized elements, user-defined value types etc.).

This also needs a change in `void ViewPureChecker::endVisit(MemberAccess const& _memberAccess)`

So, SMT now says the function pointer parameter is not supported or so and only prints that as a warning. 
Is this good enough for now? I suspect the issue is maybe not with my addition in that case

Sounds good!
