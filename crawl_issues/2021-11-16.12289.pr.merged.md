You accidentally included some files that should not be there (evmone etc) - can you please remove them?

Can you maybe isolate out the test cases that do not have any review comments into their own PR so it can be merged quicker?

It seems you still have failing tests here.

The following tests cases run on my local system using isoltest. But CI/CD on github shows them to be failing. 

1. library_function_external.sol ( works on local but output mismatch on Github )
2. copy_from_calldata_remove_bytes_data.sol ( works on local but Compile Error on Github )
