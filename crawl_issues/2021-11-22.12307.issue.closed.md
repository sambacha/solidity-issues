Hi Experts, 
I’m forking SafeMoon on test net, everything looks OK however the Smart Contract doesn’t distribute tokens for the holders, the contract is published on Test Net for your review, and I listed below all the steps I followed, it all went well except step # 5
I appreciate your feedback. 
1-	Contract Owner Launched the token (https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x1a2650AA65d96EbC7dd5854f0B9032615629F442#code) 
– Expected Behavior (Pass)
2-	Contract Owner created the pool with (Safemoonfork & BNB)
https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0xd5c4584dd7711afaf3f49ff8c280bcb22c253581e6f2566daf16cb18808fe956
– Expected Behavior (Pass)
3-	User 1 bought 30 token, received as 27 because of the 10 percent tax  (https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0xbb9f2518b441b86cbe34e227ea177157c060161ee8c947a504a0b265997ab9f1 )
– Expected Behavior (Pass)

4-	 User 2 bought 40 tokes, received as 36 because of the 10 percent tax  (https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0xc2372f808ce819c952b79de6f89c77e2ae19c0e8fb878c62ec70a30505f0c4fb) 
– Expected Behavior (Pass)

5-	User 1 should receive some tokens because he’s a holder, user 1 still have 27 Tokens only – Not Expected
– Not Expected Behavior (Fail)

Have you actually checked that the code is correct? Can you reproduce the same problem e.g. on Ganache or in Remix?

If this is really a bug in the compiler, it would be a serious problem in code generator and those are pretty rare in practice. Most often when we get reports like this it's actually a bug in the contract so we need to exclude that possibility first. Can you show a specific part of code that clearly didn't give a correct result based on the code and variable/parameter/state values?

Hi @cameel , thank you so much for your reply, I don't think it's a compiler issue. I copied the code from Safe Moon token (https://www.bscscan.com/address/0x8076c74c5e3f5852037f31ff0093eeb8c8add8d3#code) and I just changed the token name as you can see here ( https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x1a2650AA65d96EbC7dd5854f0B9032615629F442#code ), the code is working fine with the actual token Safe Moon and I was able to deploy the token using Remix, but it doesn't distribute tokens in my token, I think I'm missing something in how I should make this work! maybe it's related to the Pancake swap router or I should create a pool in a certain way! I don't know and thus, I posted these questions here to ask experts (like yourself) if you have experience in reflection tokens to let me know if I'm doing anything wrong!

Oh, in that case please try the [#soldity](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) channel on gitter or [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com). This bug tracker is only a place to report compiler bugs and submit feature requests.

does you found the solution for this?

> does you found the solution for this?

Yes I found a solution, I used to make small transactions. thus, the reflection was too small to be viewed on the transaction, I increased the transaction size (E.G. %5 of the liquidity) and I saw the reflection coming, in a real-life scenario, the holder will see the election after multiple transactions (it will add up per transaction).
Let me know if this makes sense?
