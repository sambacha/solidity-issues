# [\#12315 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12315) `merged`: [CI] Correct workflow name in gitter notifications

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-11-23 15:46](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12315):

Currently gitter notifications from CI look like this, even if they're not a part of a nightly run:

> ❌ Nightly job **b_archlinux** failed on **develop**. Please see [build #909430](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/909430) for details.

This PR changes it to something like this:
> ❌ [main] Job **b_archlinux** failed on **develop**. Please see [build 909430](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/909430) for details.

- Workflow name is used instead of hard-coded `Nightly`. Unfortunately this requires an API request and `jq` installed on the host because there's no env variable that has the workflow name.
- I removed the `#` character from build name because with it the number is interpreted as a channel name and the link is harder to click.
