# [\#12316 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12316) `merged`: CI: Don't require `jq` to extract workflow name

A small tweak to #12315. Looks like `jq` is less widespread than I thought. I don't want to go over all jobs and install it so instead this PR replaces it with a combination of `grep` and `cut` that should be more portable, even it not as flexible.
