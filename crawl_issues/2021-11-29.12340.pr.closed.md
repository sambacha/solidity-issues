Thank you for your pull request! I think the architecture could be a bit improved here:

1. LinkerObject is too low-level and should not print anything on stdin / stdout. I think it would be better to change the link function to return the set of used libraries, for examples. Alternatively, you could add a new function on LinkerObject that returns the set of referenced libraries and is called before link() is called. This way, you could also detect references to unknown libraries

2. If you have two different contracts and compile them at the same time, they might reference different sets of libraries. The compiler should only report if a library was supplied but not used by any of the contracts. This means that this mechanism has to be put inside the commandline interface.

Hey @chriseth, can you take a look at it? I moved the reporting to the CommandLineInterface as you requested.

What's the current state here? Tests are failing.

Seems to need another round of review and a rebase.

Closing this for now. Like I said in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12341#issuecomment-1176524665, feel free to comment if you're actually still interested in getting reviews here or reopen if you want to continue working on it.
