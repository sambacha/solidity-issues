Closing this for now. Given the silence on other PRs I suspect you're no longer interested in working on them (which is understandable - sorry for the lackluster reviews but unfortunately our capacity to review extra PRs was and still is a bit limited). 

You're welcome to reopen if you decide to resume working on it. Or, in this case, post a comment if you're still interested in getting a review - this one was actually not reviewed at all so far.
