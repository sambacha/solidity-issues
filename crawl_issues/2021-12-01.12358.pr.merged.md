# [\#12358 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12358) `merged`: Fix ICE when unsafe targets are solved more than once and the cex is !=

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-12-01 16:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12358):

The fix here is to actually not reset which targets were proven unsafe/safe. This is fine because the CHC and ModelChecker objects are never reset (from CompilerStack). This potentially also saves redundant queries, like in the added example. This test in isoltest didn't fail before this PR, but it did ICE when running the CLI and standard JSON. I ran it locally and it doesn't happen anymore.
