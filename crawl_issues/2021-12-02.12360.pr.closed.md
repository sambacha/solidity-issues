# [\#12360 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12360) `closed`: [WIP] Codify coding standards with superlinter/formatter Trunk
**Labels**: `external contribution :star:`, `testing :hammer:`

Trunk is a **new superlinter & formatter** that makes it easy to turn on dozens of linters, including clang-tidy, which is otherwise hard and slow to run and was not previously being run in solidity. https://docs.trunk.io This PR enables these linters:

- actionlint
- black-py
- clang-format
- clang-tidy
- flake8
- gitleaks
- hadolint
- isort
- markdownlint
- prettier
- shellcheck
- shfmt

Most of these were not being run already, but this achieves better coverage of checking all the files in the repo, including linting dockerfiles, autoformatting yaml, and import sorting python. **_nearly_ everything in the solidity coding style guide can be completely automated with the right set of linters and configuration.**

Also, this makes it easy for contributors to check if their changes are lint and format clean before pushing a PR - iterate on/fix their changes locally.

Some of the existing issues this exposes:
- inconsistent shell script formatting (tabs, spaces, etc)
- not every C++ file is clang-format clean
- various inconsistencies in naming that clang-tidy can be configured to enforce (I started defining these in .clang-tidy but didn't define everything possible)
- various buggy-looking code, modernization, readability, and performance issues via clang-tidy
- Dockerfile issues such as `MAINTAINER is deprecated`

Note: clang-tidy only works with compile_commands.json in the repo root, generated from a clang build

Next steps:
- Further tune linter configs to cover the whole coding guidelines of solidity
- Integrate Trunk on CI - trunk CI integration can post inline annotations on PRs
- Optionally: include the trunk launcher script in the repo (such as in `.trunk/bin`) so other users can use trunk quickly
- Document the requirement to have clean linting via trunk to land code in solidity

Is it possible to reduce the number of magic dotfiles in the project root? Can they be moved somewhere else?

Agree with this.

Although the PR looks stale?

Thanks for the PR! The team has agreed that we do not need all of this at the moment, so I'm closing the PR.
