Looks like CI checks don't run on this PR.

So we need to either have @minaminao [log into CircleCi](https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize/) and follow the project or just force merge the PR.

I looked at the CircleCI dashboard and it seems that I can't follow `ethereum/solidity` because I don't belong to the `ethereum` organization.
