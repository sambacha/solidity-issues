In `Ubuntu 20.04` node that uses [amd or arm] architecture, snap is not able to install v0.7.6 as a older version. Would it be possible to add `solc v0.7.6` as older version into snap? Related to this should I contact with snap?

For example for amd instances:

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-40-250:~$ sudo snap info solc

Not sure if snap stores specific older versions or only allows the latest one in each channel. Pinging @elopio, since he is the one managing the snapcraft packages.

In the meantime, if you need a specific version of the compiler I'd suggest to simply grab it from  [solc-bin](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/). It contains static self-contained binaries, just download and run, no installation needed.

For `aarch64` aws nodes, I need `arm64` binary for `v0.7.6``. 

In the `solc-bin` url I was not able to find it. If you can link me into the binaries page that will be helpful.

Please note that I am unable to see the binaries under ` https://solc-bin.ethereum.org/linux-arm64/` related to `v0.7.6`.

Oh, you said "amd or arm" so I thought you're fine with either. If you specifically need an ARM build then yeah, unfortunately we don't have those in solc-bin yet (#11351).

Note that you can also use the [wasm binaries](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/emscripten-wasm32) via [solc-js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js) on ARM. They're not as fast as native ones and solc-js has more limited set of CLI options but at least they work everywhere.

@cameel Thanks. From `wasm binaries` can I create a `./solc` binary file? As I understand I have to use them along with `solc-js`

No. You drop them inside solc-js dir (replacing the file called `soljson.js`) and then you can use the [`./solcjs`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/master/solcjs) script as the CLI. Or, to use it as a library in a JS program, you just import the package.

@cameel Thanks
