Alright! Will do it as soon as it gets merged.

Oh, one more thing: could you squash your commits? Our convention is to have each commit represent one complete change, without subsequent commits adding stuff and then removing it. Any review fixes should be squashed into the commits they modify before the PR is merged.

Of course, I will do it when I get home.

I have just reviewed #12378 and it reminded me that we need one more thing here: print a message when the output is empty. We currently only have that for compiler mode. Fortunately the situation in assembler mode is simpler than for compilation because we can only have one input file and the file always represents one contract. So we only need a message saying that assembling was successful but no outputs were selected.

I added the printing of this message.

#12376 has been merged today so tests should pass if you rebase on `breaking` now.

Alright!

Hey @cameel, how should I do it? When I try to rebase it shows that it will also add 122 commits there and I can't find a way to squash them.

That does not sound right. When I try it locally it only tries to rebase the one commit you have here. Is your local `breaking` up to date? And are you sure you have the same `dont-select-any-outputs` you have here checked out and not some older version that was still on `develop`?

Your `breaking` should be at commit 0bbf58ec5e7fc920423e4b4ba4fbfae8612e3af2. The version of `dont-select-any-outputs` that I see is at a3422536dd049df388e05b269b462c878093221d.

Everything is like you said, this and the breaking branch are exactly like this.

But are the local labels you're using at these commits too? They could be out of sync with remote ones. Can you check if the commit ID printed by `git rev-parse HEAD` is what it should be when you check out these branches?

Also, which commands do you use to rebase it? I'm using these:
```bash
git checkout mejsiej/dont-select-any-outputs
git rebase origin/breaking --interactive
```
where:
- `origin` = `git@github.com:ethereum/solidity.git`
- `mejsiej` = `git@github.com:mejsiej/solidity.git`

Ok, it is now rebased!

I think you have pushed the wrong branch. It looks like one of your other PRs.

No, the problem was that I used the version of CommandLineInterface.cpp from my branch and not breaking. Just changed it right now.

All of the tests have passed.
