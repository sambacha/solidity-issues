Closes #10275.

## Added options:
- ### --machine-readable
   #### Makes the output machine-readable, by removing the headers from it.

   It affects all the options from the "Output Components" group and --gas option.

   It cannot be used together with with:
    - standard-json
    - output-dir
    - link

  Throws an error if there are more than two outputs selected.

- ### --ewasm-wast
   Use it to get .wast output.

- ### --ewasm-wasm
  Use it to get .wasm output.

No, I was only reviewing. I haven't had time to even properly finish reviewing it.
