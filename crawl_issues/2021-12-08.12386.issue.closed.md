**Labels**: `good first issue`, `testing :hammer:`

Currently `isoltest` automatically enables `--enforce-gas-cost` option but only if other options conflicting with it are not used (i.e. `--abiencoderv1` or `--evm-version` other than the latest). It's easy to miss that, especially if someone is not yet familiar with all the quirks of the tool. Isoltest should print a message if it's not actually enforcing gas costs.

@cameel  As you mentioned, we can add the warning around this line in the code. 

If possible, I'd like to take this issue up.
