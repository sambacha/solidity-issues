# [\#12387 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12387) `merged`: [CI] Adjust job parallelism to actually match available resources
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

I have noticed that `parallelism` setting for our jobs does not actually match how parallel they actually are:
- `t_ubu_codecov` and `t_ubu_asan_soltest` run `soltest.sh` (not `soltest_all.sh`) so I think they do not take advantage of `parallelism: 6` at all.
- `t_ubu_soltest_all` and `t_ubu_release_soltest_all` actually do 15 separate soltest runs so `parallelism: 6` seems low. I think that increasing `parallelism` would decrease their runtime from 30 min to something more reasonable.

Still a draft because I need to see how much this actually speeds things up and potentially adjust the numbers. I set `soltest_all` parallelism to `15` (2.5 times more) but some runs are longer than others so I suspect it won't give us a 2.5x speed up. On the other hand maybe there's no harm in having it at 29 because I think that we only pay for the time each parallel job actually takes. I would have to look at our credit use to be able to verify that though.

This change decreased `soltest_all` runtime by half. It now takes 15-18 min compared to 30-33 min before. No results for `codecov` yet - still running (it normally takes ~1h).

There are actually 2 groups of runs: optimized that take ~5 min and non-optimized that take ~15 min. So it looks like 15 min is the lowest we can get without #12388.

- `t_ubu_asan_soltest`: no significant difference, still at ~15 min.
- `t_ubu_codecov`: 1:06h and 1:10h compared to 1:07h in the today's nightly run.

I thinks it's safe to assume that these do not need parallelism. In that case I'm removing it and also changing `soltest_all` to 15.

This is now ready for review.
