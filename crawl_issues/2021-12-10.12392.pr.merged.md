# [\#12392 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12392) `merged`: Fix `t_ems_test_ext_colony` nightly job
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This fixes the [`t_ems_test_ext_colony`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20939/workflows/94cccdc5-cad7-496a-8368-76ebb9691870/jobs/921133) job, which has been failing in the nightly run for a few days.

I think it's because it runs on nodejs 17. Apparently I introduced the bug in #12192 - I changed the default nodejs version for external tests to `latest` (currently nodejs 17) there but only for the compile-only test and missed the nightly one.

The job fails because `python` is needed to build the native extension for the `sleep` npm package. We could easily install Python but I think it might still not run on 17 due to other problems and for now I just want to restore the job to what it was.

Rebased. Does the test run on this PR at all?

It does not run on this PR, only on nightly. I can push a test commit to make it run if you want but I'm pretty sure this is the cause of the failure.
