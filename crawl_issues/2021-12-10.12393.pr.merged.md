# [\#12393 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12393) `merged`: Avoid double compilation in Colony external test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Bare `yarn` command does more than just `yarn install` (I think it runs `yarn build` as well). As a result contracts are being compiled twice because we also run `yarn build` explicitly, which can be seen in the output of the colony job.
