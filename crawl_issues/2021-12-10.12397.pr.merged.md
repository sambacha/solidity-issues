~Depends on #12396.~ Merged.

There are several cases where we have to disable a run with specific settings because it does not pass tests but it still compiles. Such a preset is skipped even in `COMPILE_ONLY` mode. This PR adjust the testing mechanism to make it possible to skip only the JS tests without skipping compilation.
