Hi, do you guys know how to solve the following "'boost::test_tools::tt_detail::......." make error? My Ubuntu 16.04 has Boost 1.66 installed.

I think your Boost version might be too old. The failure seems to be related to the `boost::test_tools::tt_detail` namespace, which AFAIK was introduced in Boost 1.59.0. We do require Boost >= 1.65.0 though, so if yours is indeed too old, it's weird that you did not get an [error from `EthDependencies.cmake`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.10/cmake/EthDependencies.cmake#L40) instead.

Can you check which version your are using?

Please also try updating your compiler. I think we still do support 8.0.1 but it's already pretty old. If upgrading it solves your problem then maybe we need to think about bumping the requirement.

Hi @cvcook7! We're closing this issue due to inactivity. If @cameel's suggestion didn't help you, feel free to reopen it. Thank you!
