# [\#12401 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12401) `closed`: Type deduction for inline empty array constants in function parameters
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

## Description

Given these two contracts, where `B` is trying to call the constructor of `A` with an empty array:

```
contract A {
    address[] addresses public;
    constructor(address[] memory _addresses) {
        addresses = _addresses;
    }
}

contract B is A {
    constructor() A([]) {  // (*)
    }
}
```

At line `(*)`, I get `TypeError: Unable to deduce common type for array elements.`

If I change the parameter from `[]` to `(address[]) []`, I get `TypeError: Invalid type for argument in modifier invocation. Invalid implicit conversion from type(address[] memory[] memory) to address[] memory requested.`

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.10
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): compiler default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

See above.

I currently don't see how to solve this, sorry.

You can bound the type by looking at where the data is being sent (in this case, the function parameter).

As a workaround, how do I create a typed empty array and pass it from a constructor to the suoerconstructir? I can't seem to find a way.

As one concept in Solidity, types of expressions are purely determined by the types syntactically inside the expression.

As a workaround you can use a free function:
```
function newAddressArray() pure returns (address[]) {}
```

Thanks for the suggestion, that solves my immediate problem, at least.

For locals, you can simply declare 

```
address[] memory empty;
func(empty);
```

however `empty` cannot be declared without an assignment, for a field of the contract (and a local can't be declared before a superconstructor call). Shouldn't the syntax of fields and local variables be the same?

It's currently (v0.8) not possible to both declare and pass a dynamic-length array in a one-line statement.

However, if you are able to define the values passed to the `B` constructor, you can create an array param in the `B` constructor, and then pass it to the `A` constructor:

```
contract B is A {
    constructor(address[] memory _addresses) A(_addresses) {
    }
}
```

Then you just need to pass the empty array to the `B` constructor from the deployer script:

_offchain JS deployer:_
```
myContract.deploy([]);
```

_onchain Solidity deployer:_
```
address[] memory empty;
new B(empty);
```

@petr-hejda Thanks, yes, that's what I was doing before, but I didn't want to pass the array into the sub-contract's constructor, so the function solution that @chriseth supplied works better in my case.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
