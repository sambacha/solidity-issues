# [\#12404 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12404) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Fix soundness of struct storage/memory pointers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2021-12-13 21:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12404):

The bug here is that not enough knowledge was being erased for soundness when struct pointers were involved.

The newly added tests were all buggy, since the smtchecker was saying the assertions were all safe.
