## Description

For private deployment of Ethereum I would like to deploy "larger" contracts than on mainnet.
Here's example of such smart contract: https://gist.github.com/citizen-stig/a25be3d125969c64f0f2b94b28a0d160

solc is able to compile this smart contract normally, but hangs when optimization is enabled.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.10+commit.fc410830.Linux.g++
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): No
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Besu
- Operating system:  x86_64 GNU/Linux 5.15.6-arch2 Archlinux

## Steps to Reproduce

Download example source code from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/citizen-stig/a25be3d125969c64f0f2b94b28a0d160)

Run this command:

```
solc --bin -o build_check --optimize --optimize-runs=200 --no-optimize-yul ./MediumVerifier.sol
```

### Expected result

Code is compiled, same way as without optimization.

### Actual result

Compiler hangs, consuming 100% of single cpu thread.


### Notes

Outcome is the same if `--optimize-runs=1`

This is probably due to the constant representation optimizer. As a "quick fix" you could try storing the constants as a single large string/hex array and create the points in a loop indexing the array using inline assembly.

@chriseth thank you for quick reply!

Could you please elaborate more on "quick fix"? Should I store data in hex or decimal? Should it be large string or array of strings? 
What is the most efficient way to create points using inline assembly. Thank you.

I did a research on the problem. First of all, [MediumVerifier.sol](https://gist.github.com/citizen-stig/a25be3d125969c64f0f2b94b28a0d160)
 compilation finishes successfully, but it takes a lot of time. When I checked that for the first time it took almost 5 hours. Recently I updated to the newest develop and now it needs approximately 2 hours. I am not sure if the time drop is related to the recent changes in solc or to my local environment setup. Anyway, while debugging I find out that compiler spends a majority of the time in [Assembly::optimiseInternal](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L406). It involves [JumpdestRemover](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/JumpdestRemover.h#L33), [PeepholeOptimiser](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/PeepholeOptimiser.h#L33) and [CommonSubexpressionEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/CommonSubexpressionEliminator.h#L62). Code profiling confirmed that the compiler spends nearly 100% time on the code optimization. [CommonSubexpressionEliminator::getOptimizedItems](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/CommonSubexpressionEliminator.cpp#L37)  is the most time-consuming process and takes 96.5% of this whole time.

Can you find out how many iterations the loop in `Assembly::optimiseInternal` is run and how long each iteration takes?
Another useful information might be how long the chunks are that are passed to the CommonSubexpressionEliminator (i.e. the distance between `iter` and `orig`) and how often `shouldReplace` is false.

With #12801 I managed to reduce compilation time in a release build from 45 to 21 minutes. 99.99% of that time compiler spends in [Assembly::optimiseInternal](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L406) iterating 1614 times over the [main loop](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L429). Meanwhile `shouldReplace` has value `true` 1010 times and value `false` 2608589 times. More detailed data on that:

To improve readability, I filtered out all entries where shouldReplace=false and iterations <= 1.
