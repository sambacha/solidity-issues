# [\#12412 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12412) `merged`: Labels in issue templates

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-12-15 19:59](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12412):

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/pull/159#discussion_r769602005 by @christianparpart gave me and idea that we could automatically apply labels in our issue templates.

The PR also does some minor cleanup in templates:
- Replaces tabs with spaces
- Removes hard wrapping to make the instructions look more concise. Text in Github's issue editor is always soft wrapped. It also will never show up in the preview and even if it did, Github does not remove hard wrapping when rendering issue comments as would normally happen in markdown.
