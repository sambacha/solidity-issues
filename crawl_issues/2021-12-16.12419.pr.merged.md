# [\#12419 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12419) `merged`: Move `about` field from issue templates to `config.yml`

Follow-up to #12413.

The config gets picked up but the URLs don't show up in the template chooser. Let's see if adding `about` fields in the config fixes that.

It worked - URLs were replaced - but also the link for reporting vulnerability is gone.

For the record, here's how template chooser looked before this change:
