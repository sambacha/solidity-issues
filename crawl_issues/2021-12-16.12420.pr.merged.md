# [\#12420 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12420) `merged`: Restore security policy link and labels in issue template chooser

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2021-12-16 17:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12420):

Follow-up to #12419 and #12413.

After #12413 URLs work but the "security policy" link has disappeared from the template chooser and also `labels` fields in the templates are now ignored.

This PR:
- Manually adds the security policy link
- Puts labels in the URLs directly
