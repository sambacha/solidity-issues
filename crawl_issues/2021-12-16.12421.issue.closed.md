The [`update`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/update) script in [`solc-bin`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/) takes ~10 mins regardless of how many cores you throw at it. That's because while it uses the async/await mechanism in JS but it's still single-threaded. We can reduce that time by parallelizing it and switching to a larger resource class in CI.

Hi everyone! This issue has been closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
