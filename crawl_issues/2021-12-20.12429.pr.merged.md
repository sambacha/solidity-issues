# [\#12429 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12429) `merged`: [SMTChecker] abi.encodeCall

Going with the small fix, the better fix would also solve the false positive on test `_2`.

@ekpyron this is also ready for review

What happens for this?
```
abstract contract D {
	function no(uint a, uint b) external virtual;
	function f(function(uint, uint) external) external pure virtual returns (uint256);
}

contract C {
	function abiEncodeSimple(D d1, D d2) public pure {
		assert(d1.f(d1.no) == d1.f(d2.no)); // should fail
	}
}
```

Or put differently: the only case in which the effects of a member-access expression of a function type is *solely* determined by the function by the function signature, is in the first argument of ``abi.encodeCall``, isn't it? Anywhere else the address in there can have an effect... So maybe it makes sense to do this more selectively?

Output:

```Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
Counterexample:

d1 = 0
d2 = 0

Transaction trace:
C.constructor()
C.abiEncodeSimple(0, 0)
    d1.f(d1.no) -- untrusted external call
    d1.f(d2.no) -- untrusted external call
 --> a.sol:8:3:

8 | 		assert(d1.f(d1.no) == d1.f(d2.no)); // should fail
  | 		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

Not sure I get exactly what you mean? The function expression itself is represented by the signature, but if you *call* that function pointer, its value will be nondeterministic if we can't infer what the function actually is.

This should not affect any tests that don't involve ``abi.encodeCall``... did you try reverting all those test changes after changing the PR to only do this specifically for ``abi.encodeCall`` instead of for all member accesses of function type?
