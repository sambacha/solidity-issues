Implements `textDocument/definition` and adds test for it.

- [x] type symbol -> type definition (contract, enum type, enum value type, ...)
- [x] variable name -> var decl
- [x] return variable name `x` -> jump to `x` in `returns (uint x)`
- [x] `import "file.sol"` -> jump to top of imported file "file.sol"
- [x] `import {x} from "file.sol"`, hover `x` -> jump to `x` in "file.sol"
- [x] `import {x as y} from "file.sol"`, having `y` hovered in file -> jump `x` in "file.sol"
- [x] function call name -> jump to function definition
- [x] function parameter name `x` to jump to function parameter def `x`
- [x] "Can you check how virtual lookup works in this case? Is it at least relative to the location of the expression or will it always go to the base?"
- ...?

General question I only asked in the meeting today: How de we handle virtual function calls? Is it fine to just jump to the definition that the call would resolve to from the current context?

> LGTM, just a few minor details. I assume the whole thing will be merged to only a few commits eventually?

Applied.

Please also check that a "goto definition" on a struct constructor call goes to the struct.

It also needs squashing.
