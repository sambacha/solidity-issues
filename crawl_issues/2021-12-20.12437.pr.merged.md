Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12435

TODO:
 - [x] changelog entry
 - [x] general tests
 - [x] test to check if this works properly if referencing a base contract function.

> Fixes #12435

Before we can use that here we also need to change the blog post because that's a part of the issue.

Is this legal? Or is it rightly illegal?

```
contract C {
  function f() external { abi.encodeCall(C.f, ()); } // Error: Function must be "public" or "external".
}
```

Edit:

Funnily enough, the following already works. I suppose this is because `this.g` is not referencing the declaration but a pointer to an externally callable function.

```
contract C {
  function g() public { abi.encodeCall(this.g, ()); }
}
```

However, encoding a call to a public function declaration does not work but selector on the said declaration works:

```
contract C {
  function g() public {}
  function h() external { abi.encodeCall(C.g, ()); } // Error: Function must be "public" or "external".
}

contract D {
  function i() external { abi.encodeCall(C.g, ()); } // Error: Function must be "public" or "external".
  function j() external { C.g.selector; } // Works
}
```

Oh, we should definitely have this as a test.

I think it should be legal because you don't really have to call the function right away. You could just store it somewhere and call later. Whether such a construct would be actually useful in practice is another matter though :)

Ok, I think this is as good as it gets WRT error messages.

The example by @bshastry is working now, added a test for it.

Restricted the test to `>=byzantium` - so this hopefully works now.

Any idea when the new version that includes the fix'd be available?

Can't give you a firm date on this but we usually release once per 1-2 months (when there's enough new stuff accumulated to be worth a release) - unless there's a security issue or a critical bug. I think you can expect this to be released somewhere in February.
