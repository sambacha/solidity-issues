# [\#12445 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12445) `merged`: [pylint] Enable more warnings
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

While doing #12444 I noticed that we still have some useful warnings disabled and they didn't need all that many changes (most of the noise is from `redefined-builtin`) so this PR enables them.

I'd enable `invalid-name`, `pointless-string-statement` and `redefined-outer-name` too but these require more effort so I left them as TODO for now.
