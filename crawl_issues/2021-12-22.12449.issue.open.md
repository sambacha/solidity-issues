- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).

## Abstract

```
Compiling 106 files with 0.8.11
CompilerError: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable dataEnd is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
```

CompilerError does not mention the location where the problem is (or at least any hints where the problem could be).

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

## Motivation

I have a huge project, removed a parameter from a bunch of functions now the project doesn't compile and not sure where to look.

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

## Specification

If it tells which file / function causes this issue, or any hints it would be helpful.

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

## Backwards Compatibility

None

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

This is an error inside a compiler-generated utility function. The problem is that the function can be generated from multiple places and it might even be that the error won't go away after you changed all the places it was generated from.

Did you activate the optimizer?

Yes the optimiser is on. Sorry about the delay in response, that time, got the error fixed. I tried reverting the changes one by one and one of them made the the code compile. I think even if compiler shows list of "possible" places that could cause the issue, that still should help the dev.

Why don't we use the debug data part in Yul to print the location?

Because it will print `#generated:4:5` or something - it won't be useful.

Maybe we could at least say which contract is being assembled?
In an example like this with 106 input files that would still be *something*.
