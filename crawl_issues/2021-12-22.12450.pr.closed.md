**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This PR reorganizes the layout of files we store in CircleCI workspace to make it more consistent between jobs/platform. Currently some jobs attach the work space at repo root, others at `build/` or random locations. Now the workspace will always be attached at repo root.

The PR also changes the location of bytecode reports because I want to reuse the same dir for benchmark reports later.

This should be fine now but CircleCI seems to be having some problems with macOS jobs. They are "not running" in all PRs, even on `develop`.

@cameel is this ready for review?

No, unfortunately it needs more work. I hit a problem in that names in the workspace conflict on macOS and Linux. I have an idea on how to solve it but this PR just wasn't a high priority so I haven't had time to go back to it yet. I was planning to once I'm done with the ext test PRs.

I won't have time to work on this any time soon and it's just a refactor so I'm closing it.
