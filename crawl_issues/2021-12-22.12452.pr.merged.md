# [\#12452 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12452) `merged`: [CI] Templates for parameterized jobs
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

The lists of parameters for external test jobs are getting increasingly verbose. I'm planning to have some of them both in `main` and in `nightly` (#12522), which will cause lots of duplication. This PR solves this by refactoring them into templates. This also makes the list of jobs more concise.
