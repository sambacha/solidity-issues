## Abstract

In `Mapping Types` section of the solidity document page, there is a simplified version of an ERC20 token showing the usage of mappings.

The `transferFrom` func in that code includes a line `approve(sender, msg.sender, amount);`.

I was wondering that the intention of this line was to decrease `amount` allowance from msg.sender, so maybe this line could be changed to `approve(sender, msg.sender, allowance[sender][msg.sender] - amount);`

It seems this example is totally broken - there is not even a check that the allowance is high enough. I will fix it, thanks for the pointer!
