# [\#12455 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12455) `merged`: [SMTChecker] Do not analyze unecessary contracts

This **MASSIVELY** reduces the size of the encoding if you set a specific source to be verified. Somehow I short circuited contracts but not sources. So entire sources were being analyzed as the root source (not as a dependency) even though they shouldn't.
