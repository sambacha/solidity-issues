I think it's better to put this message at the place where the `parse` function is called. We already have a message "SKIPPING ALL SEMANTIC TESTS" - I think it would be good to place it next to that. Note that there are two files that have this message.

Weird, I'm not seeing the warning in circleCI - will double check.
