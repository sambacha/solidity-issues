## Abstract

Using compiler option "runs" allows for bytecode optimization, but sometimes optimization expands smart contract bytecode that much it will not fit into EIP-171 (24KB). As far as I understand setting "runs=1" allows bytecode size optimization for deployment. Is there any way to have an additional argument for making optimizer aware of deployment limitation?

## Motivation

Want to optimize smart contract for execution and still be able to fit in 24KB.

## Specification

Let's introduce new parameter "smartContractBytecodeDeploymentLimit" or something like this. The optimizer could somehow reduce inlinings when the limit is exceeded.

## Backwards Compatibility

Can use 1 billion of gas as a default value to have almost unreachable backward compatibility.

A similar idea came up when discussing https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11084. 

BTW, we probably won't be able to compute this easily without a trail and error / binary search. So this can also be achieved by external tools without any additional compiler support. Regardless, this is a valid suggestion.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
