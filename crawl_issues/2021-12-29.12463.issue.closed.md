# [\#12463 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12463) `closed`: solc v0.8.11 -- SMTChecker problem in assert -- Compilation time takes too long

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36297330?u=ec716a9bef32d6f777e73680d0a24a39760696a8&v=4" width="50">[chamitro](https://github.com/chamitro) opened issue at [2021-12-29 14:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12463):

## Description

Hello everyone,
in the contract below:

pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
	struct S {
		uint[2] a;
		uint u;
	}
	S public s;
	function f() public view {
		uint u = this.s();
		assert(u <= u&u); 
		assert(u == 1); 
	}
}

solc takes too long to compile it.
After about a minute or more that the Contract is compiled, there is a warning from both CHC and BMC, that verification could not be proved. Thus I believe that when CHC and BMC find "hard" to verify a "problem" there is might be an issue that makes solc to be extremely slow.

Thank you for your time,
I wish the new year finds you healthy!

## Environment

- Compiler version: solc v0.8.11
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: 
- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04

Thanks for the issue!

I just ran with latest release and develop and got the following output in 6s:

```
Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
  --> a.sol:10:3:
   |
10 | 		assert(u == 1);
   | 		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Warning: CHC: 1 verification condition(s) could not be proved. Enable the model checker option "show unproved" to see all of them. Consider choosing a specific contract to be verified in order to reduce the solving problems. Consider increasing the timeout per query.

Warning: BMC: 1 verification condition(s) could not be proved. Enable the model checker option "show unproved" to see all of them. Consider choosing a specific contract to be verified in order to reduce the solving problems. Consider increasing the timeout per query.
```

It can happen that in some cases the SMT solvers take too long, not much we can do there. The user should just use the `timeout` option to limit how much time they want to spend on solving if they use the SMTChecker.

So you ran it with solc v0.8.11? Also is there a change that it compiles
faster locally from terminal and slower on Remix?

The compilation itself is unaffected, what takes longer is the SMT solving. Yea locally should be much faster than via Remix because of the native binaries vs web assembly.
