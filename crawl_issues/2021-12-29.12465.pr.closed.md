# [\#12465 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12465) `closed`: Improved code generation for modifiers.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-12-29 17:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12465):

fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6584

This changes modifier invocations to use function calls to the modifier with a dynamic return jump, but only if the modifier only has a single `_;`, that is the last statement and it does not have a `return` statement.

TODO:
- [ ] some more tests (open for suggestions)
- [ ] codegen for yul

I wonder if we should only do this for the new codegen. The increased complexity for the legacy codegen for this optimization is not worth it, IMO.

I actually think that it's more complicated to implement it in the new codegen :)

Having said that, we really should check that it provides a good improvement in "real" contracts.

Does this unconditionally use an internal function call or does it get inlined if the modifier is used only once? (Similar to how I understand internal functions are optimized.)

It's done at the code generation stage and the optimizer runs after that so looks like it's subject to all the optimizations, including inlining. Whether it'll actually get inlined depends on the decisions inliner will make and a lot can be improved there but that's a separate matter.

Does it make sense to do this for the old codegen still?

Closing due to inactivity + it's done only for the old codegen. Probably makes sense to do it directly on the new gen.
