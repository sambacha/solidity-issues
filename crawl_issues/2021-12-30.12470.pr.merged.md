Looks good so far! Please also experiment a bit with comparing function pointers of non-identical type, i.e. compare view, pure, payable and non-payable function pointers to different function pointers.

As far as I can see, this mainly needs better tests now.

Another set of tests that we should add is to test function types with additional slots like ``gas``, e.g.:
```
contract C {
        function f() external {}
        function test() external returns (bool) {
                return this.f{gas: 4} == this.f;
        }
}
```
We don't necessarily need to properly support such comparisons just yet, but we should at least make sure that they either work properly or raise an appropriate syntax error.

The antlr grammar test failure is probably actually a bug in the antlr grammar - maybe I'll take a look at that myself tomorrow to fix it. The rest of the test failures as far as I can see are due to a mismatching source location for one of the errors, so running ``isoltest`` locally and updating the tests should fix that.
