fixes #11483

What is done:
* Controlflows are built for modifiers
* They are properly analyzed for pruning
* lots of small changes all over
* functionflows are no longer a vector -> simpler code and unnecessary
* Prune modifiers
* Analyze modifiers in the later step
* Only build flows for modifiers that are actually used

Ah nice, very happy to see that we actually already had the loop, so there is no impact at all on runtime!
