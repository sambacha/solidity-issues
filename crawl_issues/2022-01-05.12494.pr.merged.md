# [\#12494 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12494) `merged`: Adds missing accepts to ImportDirective's SymbolAlias::symbol.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2022-01-05 11:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12494):

Found out by accident while working on goto-definition and wondering why I could not catch that AST node's `Identifier` via AST Visitor API.

Required by #12430

### ASTConstVisitor

- [x] ConstantEvaluator: looks at Identifier, but doesn't look like it's having a negative impact
- [x] ControlFlowBuilder: only looks at Variable identifiers and adds them to the current node's variable occurrences
- [x] DeclarationTypeChecker: n/a
- [x] DocStringAnalyzer: n/a
- [x] DocStringTagParser: n/a
- [x] FuncionCallGraph: performs additional checks on VarDecl's and CallableDecl's
- [x] ImmutableValidator: performs additional checks on VarDecl and CallableDecl
- [x] PostTypeChecker: cannot enter its if-condition when traversing into ImportDirective
- [x] Scoper: n/a
- [x] StaticAnalyzer: cannot enter its if-condition as it's not inside function
- [x] SyntaxChecker: n/a
- [x] ASTJsonConverter: should now contain **more** information in the exported JSON (should have a changelog entry then?)
- [x] ContractCompiler: n/a
- [x] ExpressionCompiler: does work with Identifer but is only invoked on `Expression`'s
- [x] IRGeneratorForStatements: same, but is not invoked on `ImportStatement` AST nodes
- [x] formal/Predicate: n/a
- [x] formal/VariableUsage: performs additional checks iff it's a variable that is written to (cannot happen?)

### ASTConstVisitor: unclear uses

- [x] ReferenceResolver: finds decl(s) for the identifier. It does seem to work okay.
- [x] TypeChecker: seems to work. another eye would be helpful here as it's a big handler :-)
- [x] ViewPureChecker: ?
- [x] formal/SMTEncoder: ?

### ASTVisitor

- [x] DeclarationRegistrationHelper: n/a
- [x] test/FirstExpressionExtractor: only checks expressions

As I said on the other PR: Did you check for every single visitor what the consequences of this change are?

I'm looking into it right now. I also hope that CI will be green though.

`ReferencesResolver::visit(Identifier const& _identifier)` looks suspicious. It calls `nameFromCurrentScope` which would be wrong for the import statement. Can you tell how `annotation().referencedDeclaration` is assigned for the import?

For ReferenceResolver (just like for SMTEncoder), both did not specially handle ImportDirective before, so I have both overridden and made them not recurse into it. I think that's the right solution, IMHO.

EDIT: Same for ViewPureChecker, and TypeChecker.
