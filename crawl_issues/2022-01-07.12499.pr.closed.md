Reviewers can you guys take a look here, the doc was explaining that `Base2` contract was calling `Base1` using `super` which does not make any sense as they aren't related in the inheritance graph going up.

At a quick look, the docs seem correct to me. This is exactly the point of the explanation: ``super`` does *not* refer to the next immediate base contract, but it refers to the next contract in the C3 linearization of the inheritance graph of the most derived contract.

So if the call originated in ``Final``, then ``Base2.destroy()`` will indeed call ``Base1.destroy()``, even though ``Base1`` is not a base of ``Base2``.

I actually already suggested removing ``super`` (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7261) because if one is not used to C3 linearizations this is indeed rather confusing, but there are cases that cannot be expressed without this behaviour.

Hey, thanks for checking them. I've learnt more on C3 Linearisation and now understood the concept. I stand corrected. But I think that for people coming from languages without support for multiple inheritance will have a hard time understanding this. I'm preparing a guide/notes for beginners while I'm learning too so I'm thoroughly checking the docs and stumbled upon this.

If it is okay, I feel linking to this article [Diamond Inheritance](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/solidity-diamond-inheritance/2694) will help learners understand clearly what's happening exactly. Thanks!
