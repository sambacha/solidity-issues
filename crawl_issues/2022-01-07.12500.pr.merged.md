# [\#12500 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12500) `merged`: Explaining payable(msg.sender)
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13918596?v=4" width="50">[safwen1](https://github.com/safwen1) opened issue at [2022-01-07 15:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12500):

At this point of the documentation a new Solidity learner will not understand this line without further explanation:
if (!payable(msg.sender).send(amount)) {
It should explain how msg.sender is of type "address" and not "address payable" so it cannot send or receive Ether. Therefore it must be explicitly converted to payable.
