# [\#12509 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12509) `merged`: Pin Trident external test to a specific commit to work around failing tests on master
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

#12197 did not pass the trident test but github auto-merged it anyway because that check is not marked as required.

The failing job was [`t_native_test_ext_trident`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21505/workflows/b0a5e25d-5bb4-419f-b306-772c9e44ae21/jobs/942648). One of the reasons it fails is that the file I need to ignore to work around https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/issues/283 was moved. ~This PR fixes that specifically.~

I'm not sure if it's a complete fix yet because the failing job had some other failures I'm not seeing locally and they look more serious:
```
1) Constant Product Pool Old
       #mint
         Add liquidity in 16 different ways before swap fees:

      AssertionError: Expected "46000000000000000000" to be equal 0
      + expected - actual

       {
      -  "_hex": "0x00"
      +  "_hex": "0x027e60d44813f80000"
         "_isBigNumber": true
       }
```
The PR is a draft until I ensure that this one is fixed too.

**EDIT**: It's still failing. To work around this I'm switching to an earlier upstream commit that should still work. This required adding support for checking out specific commits in ext tests.

I'm also removing the change for the moved file from this PR because it has not yet been moved in this upstream revision.

The test finally passed after reverting to a version from 2021-12-16 (i.e. last commit in `master` before the new year). This should be enough to fix `develop` and I'll prepare a proper fix in a separate PR.
