# [\#12510 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12510) `merged`: Parallel run number in gitter CI notifcations
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Currently if a job has multiple parallel runs and more than one fails we get gitter notifications that look like duplicates:

> ❌ [main] Job **t_native_test_ext_trident** failed on **develop**. Please see [build 942772](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/942772) for details.
> ❌ [main] Job **t_native_test_ext_trident** failed on **develop**. Please see [build 942772](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/942772) for details.
> ❌ [main] Job **t_native_test_ext_trident** failed on **develop**. Please see [build 942772](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/942772) for details.

This PR adds a run number to the notification to make it clear that these are just separate runs of the same job:
> ❌ [main] Job **t_native_test_ext_trident** (run 1/3) failed on **develop**. Please see [build 942772](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/942772) for details.
> ❌ [main] Job **t_native_test_ext_trident** (run 2/3) failed on **develop**. Please see [build 942772](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/942772) for details.
> ❌ [main] Job **t_native_test_ext_trident** (run 3/3) failed on **develop**. Please see [build 942772](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/942772) for details.

Since the trident run should still fail, we can immediately test it in action :-).
