Follow-up to #12509. 
~Depends on #12512.~ Merged.

This PR ensures that tests run in the same order on different machines - by sorting them. This is unfortunately not a fix for https://github.com/sushiswap/trident/issues/303 by itself - the sorted order happens to be one where tests fail - but I don't want to make it more complicated by piling on more workarounds. It would be much better to get the problem fixed upstream.

Tests do not pass due to breakage on `develop`. Fix: #12512.
