# [\#12517 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12517) `closed`: Better error message while inheritance

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88387604?u=8cde94dec7b0f0d385b55eedc61f612dce14e46c&v=4" width="50">[134dd3v](https://github.com/134dd3v) opened issue at [2022-01-12 08:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12517):

## Abstract

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

```
Contract "ContractName" should be marked as abstract.
```

## Motivation

I am currently doing a code refactor in a huge codebase. I get this error and it makes sense that I must be missing something, but I am not sure what.

## Specification

If it gives some additional info, it would really be great.

```
Contract "ContractName" should be marked as abstract.
The method 'xxxxx' defined in "IContractName" is missing implementation.
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This is just a dx thing so no backwards compatibility issue.

The solc compiler output includes the details about where the issue is, hence closing the issue (these details are not displayed by an code editor extension I was using).
