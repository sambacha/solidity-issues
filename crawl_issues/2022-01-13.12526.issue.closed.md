# [\#12526 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12526) `closed`: Allowing the usage of `type` on non-primitive types
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7003246?v=4" width="50">[barakman](https://github.com/barakman) opened issue at [2022-01-13 11:40](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12526):

My motivation is slightly more than just allowing something like `type UintArray is uint256[]`, so I will explain by code.

I have something like this:
```
library Lib1 {
    function funcA(uint256[] memory x, uint256[] memory y) internal pure returns (uint256[] memory z) { ... }
    function funcB(uint256[] memory x, uint256[] memory y) internal pure returns (uint256[] memory z) { ... }
    function funcC(uint256[] memory x, uint256[] memory y) internal pure returns (uint256[] memory z) { ... }
    ...
}
```
And for obvious reasons, I want to change it to something like this:
```
struct Obj {
    uint256[] data;
}

library Lib2 {
    function funcA(Obj memory x, Obj memory y) internal pure returns (Obj memory z) { ... }
    function funcB(Obj memory x, Obj memory y) internal pure returns (Obj memory z) { ... }
    function funcC(Obj memory x, Obj memory y) internal pure returns (Obj memory z) { ... }
    ...
}
```
My current solution is to wrap `Lib1` inside `Lib2`:
```
import "./Lib1.sol";

struct Obj {
    uint256[]
}

library Lib2 {
    function funcA(Obj memory x, Obj memory y) internal pure returns (Obj memory z) { z = Obj(Lib1.funcA(x.data, y.data)); }
    function funcB(Obj memory x, Obj memory y) internal pure returns (Obj memory z) { z = Obj(Lib1.funcB(x.data, y.data)); }
    function funcC(Obj memory x, Obj memory y) internal pure returns (Obj memory z) { z = Obj(Lib1.funcC(x.data, y.data)); }
    ...
}
```
But this has two downsides:
1. Minor: code duplication
2. Major: higher gas cost

I believe that `uint256[]` and `struct Obj { uint256[] data; }` have the exact same memory-layout.
Moreover, I believe that they also have the exact same ABI-encoding.
If so, then there should be a way to achieve my goal without the two downsides mentioned above.

Ideally, the Solidity language could simply support something similar to `typedef uint256[] struct Obj` in the C language.
However, the `type` keyword does not seem to support this for non-primitive types.
Is there any other way (assembly, etc)?

Thank you.

The ABI type of ``strict Obj { uint256[] data; }`` is ``(uint256[])``, i.e. an unary tuple of ``uint256[]``. That's distinct from ``uint256[]`` and will have a different encoding: there will be an additional indirection in the encoding, i.e.
``0x20, 0x20, 1, 42`` is an ABI encoding of ``Obj`` with ``data`` of length 1 with one entry of value ``42``, while
a simple array of length 1 with one entry of value ``0x42`` is merely encoded as ``0x20, 1, 42``.

We only recently introduced "user-defined value types" using the ``type MyUint is uint256;`` syntax - it is well possible that we will extend this to support non-value types (e.g. structs and arrays) in the future, but since the support for user-defined value types is not even complete yet, it may take a while until we get there.

I'm not quite sure I understand the concrete reason for your encapsulation into a struct in your snippets - but that's the current state of the "typedef"'s I think you are requesting: it will probably happen eventually, but not in the immediate future.

@ekpyron: Thank you for the very quick response!

My concrete reason is for users of that library to be able to use `Obj` arguments instead of `uint256[]` arguments.

I've figured I could use `struct Obj { uint256[] data; }` without any runtime impact (including gas-cost).

But since the ABI-encodings are not identical, as you've just explained, I now understand that replacing `uint256[]` with a `Struct Obj { uint256[] data; }` would increase the gas-cost.

So going back to my original goal - passing `Obj` arguments instead of `uint256[]` arguments, **regardless of what `Obj` is** - I guess that the only way is by allowing `type Obj is uint256[]`.

Is that correct, or do I have any other way to achieve this goal?

To me it very much sounds like you need ``type Obj is uint256[];``, i.e. user-defined types that go beyond value-types, yes. Which is on our agenda, but I wouldn't expect it to be available in the immediate next releases.
But we're working on improving this and will get to more complete support for arbitrary user-defined types with custom operators, etc, eventually :-).

Isn't this a duplicate of #1100?

@cameel @chriseth : any word on this?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
