# [\#12529 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12529) `merged`: External test for Euler
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.

This adds an external test for [Euler](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts).

This one was fairly straightforward. No source patching needed. On 0.8.11 some presets exceed deployable code size so I only needed to add a helper for turning on `allowUnlimitedContractSize` in Hardhat.

Unfortunately it's one of the projects that cannot be compiled via IR at all (#12343).
