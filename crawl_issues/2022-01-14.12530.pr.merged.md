Part of #5956.

This adds an external test for [Yield Protocol Liquidator v2](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yield-liquidator-v2).

This one was also straightforward. It needed the `allowUnlimitedContractSize` setting too. This is why one commit is shared with #12529. I put it in both to make the PRs independent. It will disappear when one is merged and the other rebased on top of it.

 I could easily add a similar test for [Yield Protocol Vault V2](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2) but I'm not sure if we want it. The code will likely by pretty similar and it's actually a dependency of the liquidator. Let me know if you think I should add it.

FYI: (probably trivial) merge conflicts to be resolved after I merged the first one

Yeah, these ext test PRs unfortunately all have trivial conflicts with each other because they all add a new job at the end of CI config.

I could have created them on top of each other or put all of them in a single PR but I wasn't sure which ones will pass review quickly so I decided to do independent PRs instead :)

Now that they have all been accepted, I'll put them on top of each other for easier merge once they get reaccepted.
