**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.
**Depends on #12530. Don't merge until that PR is merged.**

This adds an external test for [Bleeps](https://github.com/wighawag/bleeps).

The project has an unusual structure compared to the others we have integrated so far (it's a monorepo with `pnpm` as the recommended package manager) so it was a bit tricky to get just the part we need to build and tests to run. The `main` branch also seems to be broken right now (https://github.com/wighawag/bleeps/issues/1). Fortunately there's a tag close to the top commit (`bleeps_migrations`) so I'm using that for now.

Note that the extra parameters my PR adds to `neutralize_package_json_hooks` are not used. I originally needed them for the `common-lib` library in the repo but in the and I was able to drop that. They may come in handy later though so I want to keep that change anyway.

FYI: (probably trivial) merge conflicts to be resolved after I merged the first one

Conflicts solved. As I said in, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12530#issuecomment-1013492792, I'm going to put this PR on top of #12530 now.

Wait, why does the commit of [#12350](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12530) still show up here after that's merged? Ah, I guess that's what happens, if you don't also switch the base branch on github? Anyways, the test run seems to fail, so I'll have another look next week.

Yeah, sorry looks like I did forget to switch the base branch :)

It's fails because the maintainer fixed https://github.com/wighawag/bleeps/issues/1 and I pushed a commit to switch it to `main`, hoping that it now passes tests. I think it would if not for the fact that the project now contains one 0.4.19 contract that won't compile with 0.8.11 :(

So back to the tag we go. I'll revert it to the previous version.

Fixed. It should pass tests now.
