**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Fixes #12422.

This is an experiment to see if it's the space in `-j 5` that prevents the option from taking effect on macOS.

EDIT: Looks like it works!

Well, it did take half of the time (from 22m to 11m), but you also increased the machine, so we can't know for sure it was the space.

It must have been. Take a look at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11670#issuecomment-954297346. When I was previously experimenting with it, increasing the machine size did nothing on its own. I was getting ~20 min both on `medium` and on `large`.

Thanks! Looks like this solves the issue for us.

Yeah :) The worst thing is not even the inconsistent parameter syntax but that it just ignores it instead of failing.

Oh, right, that's awesome then.
As for the  inconsistent parameter syntax, how about removing the space from all the other jobs?
The Mandalorian would say, "this is the way".

Since `-j` is not the only option that works like this, I suspect we have both variants scattered all over the codebase so I don't think it's that important. But if you want to submit a PR to change this just in the CI config, I don't mind either so feel free, it would be accepted :)
