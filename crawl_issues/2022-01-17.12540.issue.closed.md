Actually not sure how this can be implemented in a way that minimizes false positives. 

This can be an info message.

IIRC @leonardoalt put some work into having the smt checker prove reentrancy safety, but not sure how well that'll work in complex cases in practice :-).

I don't think we should rely on the smtchecker to give this type of warnings. I think what they mean is probably a syntactic check

Yeah, sure - but if we decide *against* a syntactic check, since it'd have too many false positives, we could nudge people into trying that, if they want automatic analysis (in case it works reasonably well in practice).

@leonardoalt Even for SMTChecker, one will have to manually add a reentrancy lock to a function and see if the SMTChecker can tell if the function is reentrant, right? It would be nicer if one doesn't have to add the lock.

Right that's true. For that feature you'd have to add some new query.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
