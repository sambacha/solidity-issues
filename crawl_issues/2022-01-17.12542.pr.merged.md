**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.

This adds an external test for [PRBMath](https://github.com/paulrberg/prb-math). We already have a copy of an older version of this contract in [`test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts/`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/externalContracts) but the external test will track upstream directly and will also be useful for benchmarking.

`ir-optimize-evm+yul` compiles but does not pass tests due to https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/issues/2115.

This one was pretty easy and did not need any special workarounds.
