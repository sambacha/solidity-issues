Adds event and error identifiers when calling `solc --hashes`

Output example:
```
======= D.sol:D =======
Function signatures:
c6b29b88: bigOops()
6b630cb2: smallOops()

Error signatures:
44c3d84d: BigError()
1e71f739: SmallError(uint256)

Event signatures:
57050ab73f6b9ebdd9f76b8d4997793f48cf956e965ee070551b9ca0bb71584e: Event()
510e730eb6600b4c67d51768c6996795863364461fee983d92d5e461f209c7cf: Event(uint256)
```

> Thanks for the PR. Looks very good!
> 
> Could you add a test similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests/abiencoderv2_no_warning or simply modify the contract to include an event and error?
> 
> The test output can be then interactively updated by running `./test/cmdlineTests.sh --no-smt` (assuming that you have built the `solc` binary at `build/solc/`).
> 
> Left two minor coding style suggestions.

Ended up adding to the existing one, along with the coding style changes.

@joshieDo We were wondering what made you write this PR? How are you using this information?

Initially, I was dealing with some test framework which was comparing error selectors and giving me a comparison log in the format of `0xXXXXXXXX != 0xYYYYYYYY`. I tried to find a straightforward way to get the error signatures like `--hashes` but couldn't.

In the past, I also had a similar experience, when subscribing to event topics, where I wanted a straightforward way like `--hashes`. (but totally forgot that it's 32 bytes when making this change)

Ended up forking and adding this change, and wondered if other people might be interested in it.

Please ensure that this does not only include the defined errors and events, but also the used ones, e.g. errors or events defined at file level.

@joshieDo Do you want to take care of this as well or should one of us take over for this last part?

I'm not sure where to start on that, and since I'm also tight on time nowadays, I'd really appreciate if you could take over the last part. Thank you!

Sure, no worries - thank you very much for the PR thus far, we'll take it from here!

file level events are not yet supported, but added a check for file level errors.
Rebased & merged into one commit

hmm not really sure why the externals are failing

I think this is actual breakage caused by the PR :) In Hardhat the function that fails is [`correctSelectors()`](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/src/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/compiler-to-model.ts#L603-L637) - I think the PR must have changed the `evm.methodIdentifiers` output in some way. In Trident I think that Hardhat just stopped recognizing the error that the test expects. Not sure about OpenZeppelin but it's also because it fails for a different reason so I think that Hardhat heuristics might have misdetected it as `invalid opcode`.

By the way, if our own tests passed this through, they're clearly too weak. Please try to add something that would fail in this case.
