Triggered by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12549.

We don't seem to have this documented very clearly.
To my surprise I didn't find a nice docs link to respond to that issue and @cameel also had a look and concluded in chat:

    The only thing I could find is this: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#data-location-and-assignment-behaviour:
    > Assignments from storage to a local storage variable also only assign a reference.
    I agree that we should have more on that. This is mostly glossed over.

So maybe we should think about where and how to improve the docs on this.

What about something like this example? https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/127954/using-memory-vs-storage-for-arrays-in-structs-in-solidity-qa

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
