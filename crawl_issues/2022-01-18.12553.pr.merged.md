It's a bit silly to split the function pointer into two slots only to then recombine them to a single one instead of just ``sload`` and ``sstore`` the same value...  but it's also an advantage to keep the code generic and simple, so it may even better to just keep it like this - I'm wondering how well this optimizes :-).

I'm also wondering if we should be more paranoid about testing this in various corner cases...
