# [\#12558 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12558) `closed`: ICE when copying storage structs to memory arrays via IR
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

## Description
Found while working on the external test for [Pool Together v4](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core). The contract does not compile via IR at all due to an Internal Compiler Error. With legacy codegen the compilation succeeds.

## Steps to Reproduce
Here's a distilled repro for the ICE:
```solidity
struct S {
    uint x;
}

contract C {
    S sStorage;

    function f() external {
        S[] memory sMemory;

        sMemory[0] = sStorage;
    }
}
```
```
Internal compiler error:
/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp(2962): Throw in function solidity::frontend::IRGeneratorForStatements::writeToLValue(const solidity::frontend::IRLValue&, const solidity::frontend::IRVariable&)::<lambda(const solidity::frontend::IRLValue::Memory&)>
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Solidity assertion failed
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Solidity assertion failed
```

It only happens when the target struct is a part of an array (does not matter whether dynamic or static). Does not happen when the target is just a single struct.

**EDIT**: When this is fixed, remember to re-enable the `ir-optimize-evm+yul` preset in the `pool-together` external test (which is now in `develop`): https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/93f7d5f8f0be28d84158a6ccde7fd7d2050598d6/test/externalTests/pool-together.sh#L48

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.11

This will happen for any reference type, e.g. the following will also trigger it:
```
contract C {
    uint[] sStorage;

    function f() external {
        uint[][] memory sMemory;
        sMemory[0] = sStorage;
    }
}
```

Co incidentally what I have been trying to get the fuzzer to generate :-)

Another one - apparently also doesn't have to be storage :-D...
```
contract C {
    function f(uint[] calldata a) external {
        uint[][] memory m;
        m[0] = a;
    }
}
```

For some reason we *only* took care of memory-to-memory there :-).

Actually, I think this is even the same issue as https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12220

Just a heads up - I just merged #12560 so when this if fixed, please remember to re-enable the preset that triggers this ICE:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/93f7d5f8f0be28d84158a6ccde7fd7d2050598d6/test/externalTests/pool-together.sh#L48

Hopefully it will pass. If not, disable it again and update the comment to state the new reason for disabling it.

Short update: Fuzzer reports this case (via different canonical type ~~but that does not matter~~) now which is somewhat reassuring :-)

```
contract C {
  function() external[1][] s0;
  constructor(function() external[1][] memory i0)
  {
    i0[0] = s0[1];
  }
}
```

Edit: Struck through comment regarding function types being uninteresting

External function pointers as base type are actually a nice special case to keep in mind (since it's a multi-slot type), so it's a good case to test specifically when fixing this :-).
