# [\#12560 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12560) `merged`: External test for PoolTogether v4
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.

This adds an external test for [PoolTogether V4](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core). The contract uncovered a bug in our IR pipeline (#12558) and the optimized viaIR preset can't be enabled until that's fixed.

Other than that it was pretty easy to add. Just required removal of artifacts for a few contracts that come via npm already compiled.
