**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.

This adds an external test for [Tracer Perpetual Pools](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts).
- Unfortunately it's one of the projects that cannot be compiled via IR at all (#12343).
- It needs `allowUnlimitedContractSize`. Otherwise many tests fail due to out-of-gas reverts.
- The project does not have config for the default `hardhat` network. I had to update the `force_hardhat_unlimited_contract_size` helper to be able to handle this.
- Interestingly, the project **requires** `yarn`. You get `Error: Please use yarn to install dependencies` if you use npm :)
- They have a `master` branch but `pools-v2` seems to be the default so I used that.
