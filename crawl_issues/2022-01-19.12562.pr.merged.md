**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Part of #5956.

This adds an external test for [Brink](https://github.com/brinktrade/brink-core).
- Needed manual installation of `chai` due to https://github.com/brinktrade/brink-core/issues/48
- Tests are very picky about the bytecode.
    - On 0.8.10 they pass only with the exact settings the project uses. I.e. runs of 800 and disabled metadata.
    - On 0.8.11 tests do not pass at all.
    - `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1` makes some of them pass but not all. There are some hard-coded values in [`constants.js`](https://github.com/brinktrade/brink-core/blob/master/constants.js) which probably need to be calculated specifically for the bytecode a given version of the compiler produces.

As is, this could be used to test compilation but tests won't pass. Alternatively, we could try to add something that recalculates constants specifically for our compiler binary. Not sure how complex that would be.

@cameel so looks like we won't use this for now?

Tests won't pass and (I'm not sure it's worth the effort to try to get them to) but it's still usable as compile-only test.

I'll change it to compile-only and make it reviewable.

Converted to compile-only and ready to review.
