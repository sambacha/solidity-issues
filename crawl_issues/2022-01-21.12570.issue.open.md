The fuzzer upstream reported this bug (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/55467c1ccaffd5fcf6ea988d5e091d468a08f533/test/tools/ossfuzz/strictasm_assembly_ossfuzz.cpp#L49)

I could not reproduce via solc CLI.

Oh, "nice"! That's likely a real proper bug in the stack shuffling then :-)

Can be reproduced by the following as ``test/libyul/evmCodeTransform/`` test:
```

  function f() -> o1, o2, o3, o4, o5, o6, o7, o8, o9, o10, o11, o12, o13, o14, o15, o16, o17, o18

Out of curiosity: did you change the fuzzing in some way or is it pure coincidence that this only comes up now? The stack shuffling hasn't changed for quite a while... May very well be that it only occurs in *very* specific cases and that's why it took a long time, but not sure...

Anyways, I actually find it reassuring that the fuzzer is able to come up with this - when we started fuzzing this, I was actually surprised that this error never came up, but this report now seems to indicate that fuzzing works :-).

Ah, ok, interesting...
This is also a "StackTooDeep" case...
The stack shuffling algorithms *wants* to do a too-deep-swap, but tries to avoid it, since it's too-deep - and then hits a swapping cycle because of that...

Actually not sure if I should try to fix this in the shuffling algorithm or instead just have shuffling abort early on stack issues (either way this will ultimately report a stack too deep error, it's currently just disguised)

Might actually be nice to keep this open despite https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12572...
While https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12572 "fixes" this to a regular stack-too-deep error, theoretically, it would be possible to generate code for this without a stack-too-deep, it'd just require some trickery that's beyond the current setup...

I would tend to think it is co-incidence but will take a closer look.

> Anyways, I actually find it reassuring that the fuzzer is able to come up with this - when we started fuzzing this, I was actually surprised that this error never came up, but this report now seems to indicate that fuzzing works :-).

It is possible that the fuzzer that actually detected this issue took a long time because it is not semantics-aware (simply mutates raw bytes treating yul input as a binary stream). On the other hand, the semantics-aware fuzzer does not probe the new code transform if old code gen contains a stack too deep error. We are doing this so we can compare blockchain state (which requires a baseline i.e., old codegen).

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/3f401ebd42acae24c9bd6d800fa7f7dd3433b9f2/test/tools/ossfuzz/StackReuseCodegenFuzzer.cpp#L91

Another possibility is that this was undetected because the semantics-aware fuzzer only tests Yul optimizer + New code transform but the non semantics-aware fuzzer that found this issue only tested the new code transform i.e., assembling without optimization.

Closing this, since the concrete issue should have been fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12572

This is a big test that triggers the underlying ICE. Sorry for the bad formatting, if there is a tool I could use to auto-format yul files, I would do it.

The compiler can do it. I wonder if it would be a good idea to expose it somehow.

Thanks for the hint! Here's a much better formatted program albeit heavily indented and less readable due to it

I wouldn't say it's less readable. It's still hard to read of course but I think the unindented version was much worse because you could not see the structure at all.

I created #13550 for the formatter. Should be trivial to implement, but it's a very tangential thing so I think we should discuss on the call whether we want to add things like this to the compiler.

Hey! 👋 What is the impact of this bug? (High, Medium, Low)

Same as https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13224 - it's just a different example case. (But we already established that they don't have exactly the same cause, just the same effect, so it's a separate issue.)
