While looking at tests I gathered some timing stats for compilation:
| Project         | ir-optimize-evm+yul | legacy-optimize-evm+yul |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| ens             |   52s               | 14s                     |
| euler           |   59s               | 15s                     |
| trident         |  101s               | 39s                     |
| perpetual-pools |  103s               | 28s                     |

The value is the `user` time as reported by `time` utility.

Yeah, I was actually wondering about that :-). Not sure if that's better or worse than I expected - it's not ideal in any case :-).

The interesting thing is that for example for ENS the whole compilation+test takes almost the same amount of time in both cases (only 6s difference). This probably means that faster execution compensates for longer compilation time.

In case of Trident IR it's different though - compilation+test takes ~1 min longer which is exactly the extra compilation overhead.

I almost can't imagine how this is possible - we may save a bit of gas, but so much as to that execution time compensates half a minute compile time? Maybe, but somehow seems a bit unlikely to me :-D.

Looks like you're right. It was probably just a fluctuation in npm package installation time or something. I checked times between two CI runs of #12441, for those jobs that work both on IR and legacy, and I while I did see similar pattern for yield-liquidator in [today's run](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21742/workflows/c87245cf-2188-44f0-93f4-7f6156601a18):

it was not present in an [earlier run from 2 days ago](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21719/workflows/d6667709-78e3-4a89-9301-ae399fcb97eb):

| yield-liquidator | 0:42             | 2:40                  | 0:18                 | 2:11                      |
| bleeps           | 2:18             | 8:27                  | 0:36                 | 4:39                      |

Overall, other factors seem to have much bigger effect on total running time.

Closing this for now, since it was only meant for checking what happens anyways.
