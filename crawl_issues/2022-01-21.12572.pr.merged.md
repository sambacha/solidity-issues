# [\#12572 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12572) `merged`: Improved stack shuffling in corner cases.

"Fixes" https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12570
Well, the concrete case in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12570 is still a stack-too-deep case, so I'm not adding it as test, but I added a specific stack shuffling test for the situation that triggered a swapping cycle in the shuffling algorithm.

Generally, this PR improves some corner cases, in which junk can be popped to reduce the stack size in what would otherwise be stack-too-deep cases.

I think this being possible is a prerequisite for triggering issues like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12570, but I'm not entirely sure. (I.e. I think the issue is only due to the target being arbitrary/junk and the best slot to move there being unreachable - popping the junk slot should both avoid the issue and ideally even make the ideal slot reachable) Would be nice to continue to have the fuzzer looking for such cases.
