# [\#12582 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12582) `merged`: Switch from `solcjs` to `solc.js` in external tests
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-01-25 12:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12582):

This PR fixes the breakage we got in external tests after https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/587 got merged yesterday. For example [Colony tests](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21783/workflows/aefcceb6-82c0-419f-a3d8-f66785920024/jobs/954433) are failing because the script is now called `solc.js` rather than `solcjs`.

There's https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/590 which adds back a symlink for backwards compatibility but the link is not likely to stay there long-term so we should just switch to the new name.

Note that after https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/566, which is likely to get merged very soon, the script to run will change again (to `dist/solc.js`) so another fix will be necessary (and probably an extra command to run TypeScript compilation first).
