# [\#12584 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12584) `merged`: Code generators needed fixing of the cleanup process during typecasting

Typecasting process for "bytes" and "integers" has problems in the Old and New Code Generators

1. In the New Code generator, for the bytes type, it was sending the "from" type for cleanup instead of the "to" type.
2. Errors in the old code generator are yet to be identified

Closes #12535

The idea was not to generally *always* call the conversion functions at *all* times, but selectively enforce the conversion when emitting events, i.e. in particular in IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp:L1038 only :-).

Actually, looking at IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp:L1038 a bit more closely - you can probably get away with asserting that ``paramTypes[i]`` has ``sizeOnStack() == 1`` and then use ``expressionAsType(arg, *paramTypes[i], true)`` instead of using ``convert(arg, *paramTypes[i])`` (and thus you can leave ``convert`` and ``declareAssign`` unchanged).
