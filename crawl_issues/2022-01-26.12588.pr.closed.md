added a caveat in the comment above `iterate_start` as a notice, since fixing the issue will require a reworking of the library

If we want to further improve this, we should turn the library into a set of file-level functions and change the iterator from `uint` to a user-defined value type.

@CryptoKiddies do you think you could apply this suggestion? Thanks!

Incidentally, I'd rename `<IndexValue.keyindex>` to `<IndexValue.keyIndexWithOffset>` to document the `+1` offset which makes this logic work

Don't think I can proceed with the solution in mind until operators for user-defined value types is implemented: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11969

True, you'd need a bunch of wrap/unwrap or a bunch of new internal functions right now.

Sorry, I went ahead and implemented it here using user-defined value types: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12721

Looking forward to user-defined value types support. I'll push that example refinement in then, if @chriseth doesn't beat me to it!
