  f()
  f()

```

fails https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/597426bd1c93e1d75940d5e9dacdb55123228a01/test/tools/ossfuzz/StackReuseCodegenFuzzer.cpp#L99-L102

To reproduce, one would have to assemble the Yul code targeted at tangerine whistle, deploy and issue a call and print status code of the call.

The question here is why does the assembler emit an invalid opcode for tangerine whistle. Is the `exp` opcode not supported for that EVM version?

Invalid instruction is generated for EVM versions `<= byzantium`

Invalid instruction is also generated for latest EVM version (london). For example:

```
{
  function g() -> o {
    sstore(0, exp(0x1fff,0xfff))
  }
  function f() {
    pop(g())
  }
  f()
  f()
}
```

The only thing I could think of is that the optimizer adds a shift opcode, but I currently cannot reproduce this.

Maybe @gumb0 has any insights into this?

Yes, shifts were added in Constantinople, so shift opcode in Byzantium would be invalid.

As for London no idea, nothing was deprecated for sure.
But that (london) code should generate stack underflow instead? (could be wrong error from evmone?)

Yeah, I don't think the shift opcode is the problem, I think it's rather either a problem in evmc or how we interface with evmc.
