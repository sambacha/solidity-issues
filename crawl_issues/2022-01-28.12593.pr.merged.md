Supposed to have two commits :
1. Change occurences of isByteArray() to isByteArrayOrString(). 
2. The idea is to, in a second commit, replace such occurences of isByteArrayOrString() which are required to return True only for Bytes type with a new isByteArray() function.

We don't have a test run on the first commit (at least I cannot see it). Can you split this into two PRs just to be extra safe?

Types.h:872 has a comment `/// String is interpreted as a subtype of Bytes.` - this is now incorrect, can you change it please?
