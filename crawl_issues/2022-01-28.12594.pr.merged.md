# [\#12594 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12594) `merged`: solc-js external test on a local checkout
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-01-28 20:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12594):

Currently the solc-js external test always clones the master branch of solc-js. This is generally what we want in the main repo but I'm now trying to add a run of that test to CI in solc-js and there we actually need to be able to run on the code from a PR.

This PR extends the `solc-js.sh` script to accept a third parameter, which is a path to a local checkout of solc-js. If the argument is provided, it copies the directory and uses that. Otherwise it clones the `master` branch like it used to.
