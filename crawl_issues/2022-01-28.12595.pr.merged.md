# [\#12595 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12595) `merged`: Update release checklist for new solc-js publish process
**Labels**: `has dependencies`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-01-28 20:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12595):

**Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/596. Don't merge before that PR is merged!**

We had to adjust the way solc-js is packaged after the TypeScript migration to keep imports working for existing libraries. This PR updates the release checklist to use the new `build:tarball` and `publish:tarball` commands.
