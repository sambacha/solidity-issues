# [\#12598 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12598) `merged`: Treat root path in normalizeCLIPathForVFS as case insensitive on Windows

`FileReader::normalizeCLIPathForVFS` strips root name if the path and working directory are on the same drive. Root comparison should perhaps be case insensitive on Windows.

@cameel Hi Kamil, I wanted to make you a reviewer but do not seem to have sufficient rights (at least there is no gear icon next to **Reviewers**).

I also replaced `solAssert` with `soltestAssert`.
