## Abstract

Found code: https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-linear/contracts/LinearPool.sol#L275-L282
```
        return
            (request.tokenOut == _mainToken ? LinearMath._calcMainOutPerBptIn : LinearMath._calcWrappedOutPerBptIn)(
                request.amount,
                balances[_mainIndex],
                balances[_wrappedIndex],
                _getApproximateVirtualSupply(balances[_bptIndex]),
                params
            );
```

But can't find any documentation for such function choosing. Can anyone link to docs how it work?

`LinearMath._calcMainOutPerBptIn()` and `LinearMath._calcWrappedOutPerBptIn()` are just internal functions defined in a library and if you refer to a function by name (without giving it parameters), you get a value of a [function type](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#function-types). This is a very common convention, used for examplein C, C++, Python or JavaScript. In Solidity you can use such values in some expressions and the ternary operator is one of them.

Is the documentation on function types enough or do you think it should be refined in some way?

@cameel thanks, docs is enough, just can't find it
