# [\#12608 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12608) `merged`: Patch ElementFi external test on for disallowed `delete` on `breaking`
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-01-31 19:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12608):

Fixes [breakage in the `t_native_test_ext_elementfi` job on `breaking`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21874/workflows/fcea4f31-03c0-4925-aa86-9a57cb062626/jobs/959272/parallel-runs/1?filterBy=FAILED).

```
TypeError: Unary operator delete cannot be applied to type struct TwoTokenPoolsBalance.TwoTokenPoolTokens storage ref: Contains a (possibly nested) mapping
   --> contracts/balancer-core-v2/vault/balances/TwoTokenPoolsBalance.sol:124:9:
    |
124 |         delete _twoTokenPoolTokens[poolId];
    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

This line works fine on `develop` but on breaking it's disallowed:
```
### 0.9.0 (unreleased)
Breaking changes:
...
 * Disallow ``delete`` on types that contain nested mappings.
```

Fortunately only a single line in a single file is affected by this so forking of the whole repo is not necessary.

Right. Looks like new stuff was merged into `breaking` after I fetched it today. Should be fine now.

It failed now but it seems to be just the flaky test that I reported https://github.com/element-fi/elf-contracts/issues/240. I'll rerun the tests.
