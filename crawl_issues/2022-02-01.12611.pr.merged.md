**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This is a bunch of tweaks meant to fix breakage we've seen today in [`t_native_test_ext_bleeps`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21906/workflows/8d01aa15-01ac-4924-8357-68627af6dd16/jobs/960791) and [`t_native_test_ext_perpetual_pools`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21906/workflows/8d01aa15-01ac-4924-8357-68627af6dd16/jobs/960787).
- Perpetual Pools repo seems to have disappeared from Github. I found a fork that looks up to date and created our own fork in https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/perpetual-pools-contracts.
- I don't know what exactly is wrong with Bleeps but I suspect that it broke due to some dependency. It's reproducible on their `main` branch so I reported the problem upstream: https://github.com/wighawag/bleeps/issues/2.
    - I don't have a workaround and using an earlier commit does not help (we're already using a tagged commit) so the only thing I can do for now is to disable the test until that gets sorted out.
    - While debugging this I also tried to switch to the `main` branch. This did not help for the problem but it's something I was planning to do anyway so I'm including that change here.
- I noticed that some external tests were missing the code to process the `SELECTED_PRESETS` argument. This must be because there was no conflict after that feature was merged and I did not notice that I had to update them. I'm adding that here too.
