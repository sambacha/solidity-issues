# [\#12616 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616) `merged`: Fix missing override errors when indirectly inheriting interfaces.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12615

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) commented at [2022-02-02 19:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#issuecomment-1028281897):

So the linearized order in the snippet from #12615 looks something like this:
```
Impl -> Ext -> Base -> IExt -> IBase
```
I'd expect the bug to be triggered by `IExt` jumping in front of `Base` in the linearized order but surprisingly in this snippet it's the opposite - the override error disappears only when `Base` is before `IExt` in C3 order.

Can you add an extra test case where there are multiple layers of interfaces and concrete contracts mixed in the linearizer order? For example something like this:
```solidity
interface IBase {
    function foo() external view;
}

contract Base1 is IBase { function foo() public virtual view {} }
contract Base2 is IBase { function foo() public virtual view {} }

interface IExt1a is IBase {}
interface IExt1b is IBase {}
interface IExt2a is IBase {}
interface IExt2b is IBase {}

contract Ext1 is IExt1a, IExt1b, Base1 {}
contract Ext2 is IExt2a, IExt2b, Base2 {}

contract Impl is Ext1, Ext2 {
    function foo() public view {}
}
```
The order here should look like this:
```
Impl -> Ext2 -> Base2 -> IExt2b -> IExt2a -> Ext1 -> Base1 -> IExt1b -> IExt1a -> IBase
```

I'd also add a test with abstract contract - that case is broken too. I think your fix should cover it but it would be better to have a test checking that.

So do we consider this a full fix for #12615? I see you did not include that in the description so the issue won't be automatically closed.

Yeah, I'd say this fixes #12615.

Are we 100% sure that the change won't have *any* unwanted side-effects :-)? I'd hope so, but I'd feel better if somebody confirmed explicitly once more that it's probably fine :-). Since #12615 slipped through in the first place, I don't entirely trust our test coverage on this, though... and the override checker logic is a tad intransparent :-). On the other hand zeppelin compiles with it and it probably contains an example of most inheritance permutations :-).

Well, I thought the fix looked reasonable but now you gave me some doubts :)

The change is that now `inheritedFunctions()` will list a function at most once for each direct base, and before it would list it as many times as it occurred in the whole inheritance tree of that direct base? It sounds like what it's supposed to be doing but honestly, I don't see a direct relation to how it makes the override error appear. If anything, I'd expect it to disappear in some cases instead. But the fact that it passes the new tests and external ones suggests that it can't be that bad. We might miss some corner cases but it at least shows that it does not break anything obvious.

I agree that we need more coverage for overrides. The question is - how much and how to be sure we have enough? It's not like we'll be able to generate all possible combinations. @bshastry is there any chance the fuzzer could help us here?

I don't think we can really fuzz this :-). There's no reference for correctness whatsoever.

The insidious part of the change is that ``functionsInBase`` is a set and ``result`` is a multiset...

So before the change, the inner loop over ``inheritedFunctions`` potentially ranged over multiple copies of functions, but only one would end up in ``functionsInBase``. 

So in the example:
```
interface IBase {
    function foo() external view;
}

contract Base is IBase {
    function foo() public virtual view {}
}

interface IExt is IBase {}

contract Ext is IExt, Base {}

contract Impl is Ext {
    function foo() public view {}
}
```

in ``Impl`` when looking at functions inherited from ``Ext``, it'd only consider one base function ``foo`` - and it happened to be the one in the interface. And since we don't require ``override`` for interface functions it didn't complain.

With the change I propagate *all* function with the signature from ``Ext`` to ``Impl``. Which means I need to override both in ``Impl`` - which is a bit weird, but I think that's how our spec works right now.

In a similar case:

```
interface IBase {
    function foo() external view;
}

contract Base is IBase {
    function foo() public virtual view {}
}

interface IExt is IBase {}

contract Ext is IExt, Base { function foo() public /* maybe some override */ {} }

contract Impl is Ext {
    function foo() public view {}
}
```

When again in ``Impl`` looking at functions inherited from ``Ext``, I *only* want to consider ``Ext.foo`` itself. Previously that was guaranteed by the ``functionsInBase`` set already containing ``foo``, so inserting the functions from ``IExt`` and ``Base`` did nothing. After the change, I do it explicitly by checking ``!functionsInBase.count(func)`` before adding to ``result``.

So I think this makes sense at least for these cases, but I get a headache if I try to convince myself that there is no other cases in which this does something weird :-D.

I would in general say that we should try and simplify the entire mechanism - especially if we decide to go for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635. If possible at least :-). I actually hope that the proposed refinement of the spec with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635 (that is each direct base can contribute at most one override requirement) will make all of this easier...

The annoying part is that it'll be a challenge to do the change https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635 in a non-breaking way :-). If we want to do that and the change to be non-breaking, then we need to allow to specify additional bases beyond the required ones in the override list - but we shouldn't allow arbitrary ones, but only ones that are bases of the ones required after the change I guess :-).

The fuzzer could synthesize arbitrary inheritance patterns but I don't see how it would have flagged the underlying issue as a bug. Afaiu, the user noticed the bug because one of the two inheritance patterns produced an error while the other didn't? I mean we could write a fuzzer that checks that `contract A is B, C` and `contract A is C, B` both produce errors or both produce no errors but I think that is not what we really want here.

I don't think it has to be that complicated. We just compute the contracts you must list the same way we do now. Then, when we compare with what you actually listed, we ignore missing contracts if they're interfaces.

@cameel I agree with what you want to do - that's basically https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635.
But the current behaviour is *not* a bug - the current behaviour is how we specified inheritance and overrides.
And changing it, unfortunately, is breaking. In fact the first commit of this PR does something along those lines (even though not properly), but breaks zeppelin.

So while I agree that that's what *should* be happening, I think we have to stick to the fix in this PR for now, since that's the specified behaviour that's actually in use...

The only way out of the "nicer" solution being breaking would be to allow additional bases in the override specifier to keep the change backwards compatible... we should consider that, but we should fix the underlying issue asap anyways, so I still think we should merge this as is.

As for the specification - we have the following in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/contracts.html#function-overriding:

> For multiple inheritance, the most derived base contracts that define the same function must be specified explicitly after the override keyword. In other words, you have to specify all base contracts that define the same function and have not yet been overridden by another base contract (on some path through the inheritance graph).

Actually, reading this again now, it does say ``define`` and not ``declare``... so in that sense, we could get away with calling this a (then even more serious) bug and implement https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635 right away... the problem is that it *does* break zeppelin, though :-).

Notes from call with @chriseth: we tend towards implementing the comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12616#discussion_r797985635, i.e. not require all bases in override lists, but only those that actually implement the function - but we want to keep things backwards-compatible, so we want to *allow* specifying additional bases (in case they are bases of the required contracts).

We also need to adjust the specification in the docs accordingly.

The failing test dos not look like it is caused by this change.

Probably some time this week, yes.
However, we left https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12665 open, so the result will not be that nice until we fix that one as well (i.e. in your example in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12615 you will now not only need an override, but ``override (IBase, Base)`` which is a bit silly, but which is how we spec'ed things so far unfortunately - so we plan to relax this, but this will be some more internal effort, so we won't manage for 0.8.12...)...
