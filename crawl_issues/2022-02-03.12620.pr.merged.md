# [\#12620 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12620) `merged`: Memory-safety annotation for inline assembly.

We can also properly make inline assembly ``StructurallyDocumented``, etc, but then we need to double-check that existing natspec-style comments don't cause any errors to keep this fully non-breaking.

Can you also define what exactly memory safety means?

Sure, this needs extensive documentation before I undraft it :-).
Mainly pushed it already to see if it works for the external test runs. For trident it does - but ENS still fails, I'm just trying to figure out whether that's because it pulls in dependencies with assembly that I didn't patch or because of something else.

Eventually we should also add better reports for all of this...
Ideally, I'd report an info message whenever any variables are moved to memory and if compilation fails due to stack too deep, but could not run stack-to-memory due to inline assembly, it should properly suggest adding those annotations... Ideally even with source locations :-).

But that's a bit of a hassle, since codegen so far is not meant to report stuff like that and we may need to store the source locations somewhere, etc., so I'd keep that separate for now...

I just added a first rough draft for documenting this.

I'm wondering how restrictive we should define this - technically it's valid for stack-to-memory to access any memory that is known to be past the initial value of the free memory pointer...
Also we need to decide whether we want to specifically add the requirement for memory accesses to be bounded, i.e. the assumption for the redundant store eliminator (either as only ever allocating bounded amounts of memory, if we stay with only accessing allocated memory, or more freely as not accessing memory from unbounded offsets).

Test failures are just pending https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12624 I think

#12624 is ready.

> Looks good! Would it be much work to run a scanner over the inline assembly to see if it contains any memory operations?

Memory operations themselves we can rather easily detect in the ``AsmAnalysis`` and store in an annotation during type checking...
I'm rather worried about cases like this:
```
function f() {
    bytes memory x;
    assembly {
        x := 64
    }
    x[0x20] = 42;
}
```
So it's not only memory operations, but also lvalue references to variables of reference type in memory... that we could probably also detect in ``AsmAnalysis``... and I guess that's everthing that can go wrong :-)?
This may actually also be worth a note in the docs...

Oh wow, this is true - haven't thought about that! What could be fine is: no memory operations and only access to value types.

Hm... I wonder if I should add a nicer way to test this than command line tests - they are quite verbose and to check for all combinations of memory opcodes and memory reference variable assignments, we'll need quite a few tests...

FYI: neither ENS nor trident are "implicitly memory-safe", so both still need the annotations.

Updated the warnings. We should probably be clear that we can also merge the other one, before merging this, though. Although it doesn't matter as long as we manage for the same release I guess.
