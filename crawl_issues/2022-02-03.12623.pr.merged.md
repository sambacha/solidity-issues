The docs state that a plain `address` cannot be sent Ether. But even though `send` and `transfer` members are not available for plain `address`, the `call` is. And to my knowledge, `call` can be invoked upon a plain `address` type to send Ether to the address.

For instance, the `someone` (`address` type) can be sent Ether by invoking `sendSomeone()` method in the following `Dummy` contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Dummy {
    address someone = 0xAb8...cb2;

    function balanceOf(address addr) public view returns (uint) {
        return addr.balance;
    }

    function sendToSomeone() public payable returns (bool) {
        (bool sent, ) = someone.call{value: msg.value}("");
        return sent;
    }
}
```

[The CI failures are an unrelated issue - it's probably easiest for @chriseth to just force-merge this on Monday]
