# [\#12629 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12629) `merged`: Re-enable Bleeps external test without the failing governor test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This PR adjusts the the workaround from #12611. The problem still has not been fixed upstream and I'm not sure when it will so I thought I'd make the workaround less heavy-handed. Instead of disabling the whole external project, let's disable just the one file where tests fail.

This way we'll still get some useful benchmark output from Bleeps in #12441.
