# [\#12630 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12630) `merged`: Enable full tests in PRBMath external test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

I just noticed that the `yarn test:contracts` command I used in PRBMath external test does not really run any tests:

See the output of [`t_native_test_ext_prb_math`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/21988/workflows/5e4223ec-363b-4d67-9d1b-0970d898cb52/jobs/964219/parallel-runs/1):
```
$ yarn mocha --config ./.mocharc.yaml ./test/contracts/**/*.test.ts
$ /tmp/ext-test-PRBMath-WPZPJ9/ext/node_modules/.bin/mocha --config ./.mocharc.yaml ./test/contracts/prbMathSd59x18/PRBMathSD59x18.test.ts ./test/contracts/prbMathUd60x18/PRBMathUD60x18.test.ts


  0 passing (1ms)
```

The full test suite executes 1422 tests when I run it locally and it seems to be testing operations from the contracts too so I think we should switch to that.

I wanted to report it as a bug upstream but looks like with yarn v3 it actually does run contract tests (`1124 passing (17s)`). Since I'm forcing yarn v1 due to issues with overriding the lockfile, I won't be reporting that after all.

Fortunately `yarn test` seems to run the same set of tests on both so the fix here is still good.

By the way, I see some CI jobs failing here but that's some intermittent network issue with github:
```
ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection timed out
```
restarting them should make it pass.
