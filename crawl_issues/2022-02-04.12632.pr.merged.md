Windows requires advanced privileges for symlink creation. Adjusted tests and documentation.

Can you rebase on latest `develop`? There are some CI failures here that I have already fixed or worked around in the last few days :)

Looks like we have more CI breakage :) It's unrelated to your PR though. Should go away if you rebase on #12633.

It was a timeout in one of the ext tests. I reran it and it passed now.
