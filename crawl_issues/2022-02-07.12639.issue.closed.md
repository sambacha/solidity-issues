# [\#12639 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12639) `closed`: Ideas for built-in SMT

- do the splitting earlier, so that the theory component can report a minimal set of infeasible clauses back to the boolean component
- the theory component can synthesize simple boolean implications using bounds on variables: If we have literals `A: x <= 7` and `B: x < 8`, it can infer `\neg A \lor B`.
- when the theory component finds a set of infeasible constraints, it might be good to run it again, removing each constraint to find a minimal set (because otherwise, we will likely run it again anyway)
- because of this, the cache could actually be built such that it suffices to find an infeasible subset of the input

CDCL very rough:
look at https://github.com/msoos/minisat-v1.14
add theory conflict analysis: return clause
if we only have positive constraint literals, we can ignore anything set to false, won't be wrong but inefifcient

Relates to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12002

May be worth thinking about a more involved incremental simplex implementation Ã  la https://yices.csl.sri.com/papers/cav06.pdf

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
