Today I spent some time on prototyping and was managed to achieve O(1)-complexity dispatcher. Check out few my messages here: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/issues/2386#issuecomment-1033117651

And find code prototype here: https://gist.github.com/k06a/737fd1f389bb6f2e66f0ef76ea73729b

## Abstract

I believe dispatcher implementation initially was O(N), but now it may be tree-like O(log(n)). I assume having an O(1) dispatcher when some contract has 5+ methods is a cool achievement.

## Motivation

Contracts with tens of methods could have really slow dispatcher for most of the methods. Computing keccak256 and 2 jumps is a relatively cheap way to dispatch.

## Specification

We just need to brute-force `magic` values at compile time to achieve all selectors being mapped into 0..N-1 values. The complexity of such brute force should be `N^N/N!`. If the number of selectors is really huge we could, for example, find the first function for splitting into a few groups by 8, and then use different magic for each group. Having 1 magic number you could split 32 selectors into 4 groups by 8 and then find magic for each group. Finding magic for a group of 8 would take `8^8/8! = 416` iterations in average. Seems possible to do this in compile-time.

Pseudocode:
```solidity
const index = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(selector + (magic << 32))) % selectors.length;
JUMP(READ(table_start + index));
```

## Backwards Compatibility

The resulting dispatcher code should be fully compatible for external calls with any other versions of the dispatcher.

I will write detailed specification, hope you like the idea and have desire to implement it. I assume dispatching can cost 100-150 gas for up to 512 methods and bytecode size could be smaller than now.

I actually spent some time months ago to do something similar.
I would say: Why not?
One problem is that we still need to do the final comparison in the end, but we already do that even in the binary search case.
Another problem might be if we want to get rid of dynamic jumps at some point. Oh and this won't be compatible with code generation via Yul unless...
we implement this for the yul to evm code generation for `switch` statements in general :)

Ah, maybe I misread your algorithm: Why do you need `keccak`? Shouldn't the following also work:

```
let n := mod(byte(0, mul(X, calldataload(0))), N)
codecopy(0, add(start, mul(n, 4)))
let d := shr(240, mload(0))
jump(d)
```

Here, `N` is the number of selectors and `X` is a number that needs to be brute-forced. instead of multiplying by `X` we could also use some other strategy or more complicated formulas.

If 2 selectors are multiples of N, mulmod with any salt X will lead to a collision.

Ok, then it looks like we need to throw some xor and add operations in to the mix :)

XOR could help in some cases. In general we don’t have any proof than solution will exist for some arbitrary form of hash function. I consider keccak as safe and reliable hash to use. But we should consider some other functions, maybe we can find something better.

Case in which XOR is not working:
> Imagine we have 16 selectors and 2 of them are 0xZZZZZZZ5 and 0xYYYYYYY5. Modulus of 16 is 5 for both. XORing both selectors with any salt will keep division remainder equal for them.

What about fallback? This looks like it would map any other function to one of those N. I think this would need an extra check before the jump to ensure that the input selector actually matches the destination selector. If not, we should jump to fallback instead.

O(1) would be interesting, but what would be the magnitude of the constant cost? Would it be less than the current costs? It would be nice to see some numbers.

I played around a bit with @k06a's script yesterday. For ~10 selectors it works well but any more than that the brute forcing can take a long time. I think most contracts have more than 10 selectors, so splitting into buckets and doing multiple dispatches would likely be necessary. Not sure if it needs to be done with multiple keccak like @k06a suggested, perhaps the cheapest approach is combination of binary search until reaching small enough buckets that we can generate and use an O(1) dispatch table.

@frangio, yes and formula is `n^n/n!` of bad salts per good salt. I think we can have this parameter adjustable, and use 6-7 by default. I will provide implementation for buckets soon, it’s almost the same - just need to count min and max selectors per bucket and check (max - min) <= 1

@frangio I think we can one step solution for 50 gas, 2-step for 100, etc. Current dispatcher gas is around 150 for 10-method contract and 350 for 80-method contract, AFAIR.

Whatever we do, we need at least one full equality comparison per function, even if the contract does not have a fallback function, because there are always "false positives".

Sure, it's just that keccak is relatively expensive and if there is a cheaper option, I would use the cheaper option.

@chriseth I agree keccak256 is expensive especially on the host side, is Solidity it is relatively cheap. I will try to produce another function. But we can start with keccak256.

The probability of several selectors having the same remainders by multiple primary numbers is much lower. Moreover, we can select these primary numbers for a specific selector set exclusively. Maybe the following formula will work:
```
((selector % p1) * (selector % p2) * (selector % p3) * SALT) % N
```

At that point I don't know if it will be cheaper than keccak.

Just played with this idea of multiple remainders - it has so many collisions, not possible to find such SALT in practice for 5-10 selectors. I afraid multiplication of remainders produces more possibilities to have the same remainder after MOD N.

We could try dividing by the largest power of N that's a factor in any selector. I'd expect ``((selector / powerOfN) * X) % N`` to usually work out for some random X (maybe checking random primes would even be enough). The division can of course collapse selectors in some cases, but we don't need to use the same schema for all cases, but can just fall back to something else if it doesn't work...

@k06a Great reference.

However, reading it made me realize that we're completely overthinking this. The function selector is already a random number. If we take `selector % N` we've got a pretty good hash function that splits in pretty small buckets. The cheapest dispatch function might be %N followed by linear if-else matches. It's not constant time, but it sounds like the difference would be up to a small constant with high probability.

@frangio we could bruteforce some simple formula to ensure distribution is good enough, for example, each bucket have max 2 selectors. I think this can be achieved pretty fast even for huge number of selectors.

@frangio splitting selectors onto N bucket by just using remainder works as following for some 78-selectors contract:

That's great! I wasn't considering that empty buckets are a problem. Using xor for salting makes a lot of sense.

Got advice from @snjax that `(selector XOR salt) % n` could match for any `salt` if `n` is some power of 2 like `2**k`.

It makes much more sense to use:
```
((selector XOR salt) % prime) % n
```

And I would not suggest to use MUL instead of XOR, because it could keep remainder the same in some cases.

My current thinking is that we should use the hash function `(selector ^ salt) % n` but `n` should not necessarily be the number of functions (call it `N`), and potentially several values of `n` should be tried. The result will not be a perfect hash function but one where "buckets" are small enough that searching within that bucket still is an optimization wrt status quo.

A remaining question for me is what range of `n` it makes sense to look at. In part this question relates to what we want to optimize for. For large `n` it will be faster to find a salt that results in less collisions (smaller buckets), but there will also be more "empty space" in the bytecode which may impact deployment cost.

I started [this document](https://observablehq.com/@frangio/constant-time-function-dispatch) to analyze the probabilty distribution of bucket sizes for combinations of `N` and `n` (sorry different variable names in the doc).

I found a relatively cheap way to build a perfect hash function but this function itself is not O(1):
- Find minimal M that every SELECTOR % M is disctinct.
- Find some S that (SELECTOR + S) % M have M2 < M giving different rests, repeat

So the function will look like the following:
```
x = addmod(selector, s1, m1)
x = addmod(x, s2, m2)
x = addmod(x, s3, m3)
...
```

It will come to Mx = N relatively fast even on a huge number of selectors. But the execution of such hash function in EVM could take 100-200 gas for 100 selectors. I don't like it, so still looking for a better solution.

The "JUMP(READ(table_start + index))" in the issue description is a bit too optimistic. I wrote some pseudo-assembly to see what the rest of the boilerplate code apart from computing a good hash value is. This assumes that this mechanism is applied to code generation for yul switch statements in general, and not just the external dispatch.

In the following, the stack grows to the right.

```
//   we assume the value of the switch statement is on top of the stack
// stack: value
//   by some method, we compute a better discriminator (perfect hash function or whatever)
//   main requirement: The value is bounded by a "small" number.
// stack: value discriminator
//   compute index for jump table
push <jump_table_offset_in_code> add
// stack: value jump_table_pointer
//   we need to access the code but should not destroy current
//   memory contents, so we store it on the stack
push 0 mload swap1
// stack: vaule mem_stored jump_table_pointer
push 32 swap1 push 0 codecopy push 0 mload
// stack: value mem_stored jump_target
swap1 push0 mstore
// stack: value jump_target
jump

// FOR EACH CASE:
//    There can be "false positives". If the value is wrong,
//    we need to jump back to the default case.
//    This can be extended to multiple values per discriminator as well.
<jump_target:>
push <case value> sub <default_tag> jumpi
// now follows the code of the case block

// jump over the other cases
after_switch_tag jump

default_tag:
// code of the default case (if it exists)

after_switch_tag:
// code following the switch statement
```

We could just use `keccak256(selector) % m` where `m > n` and requires no salt brute-forcing. It seems probability of the collision for n = 100 and m = 115 is around 6% and falling dramatically during increasing of m.

I think formula of the collision probability is the following:
```
m^n / (n! * m!/(n! * (m-n)!) * m^(m-n))
```

I suppose, number of all states for `keccak256(...)%m` and n picks is m^n, and number of states without collisions is m!/(m-n)!, so P:=m!/((m-n)!m^n), for m = 115 and n=100 P=1.9e-30

@snjax I agree that adding `m^(m-n)` was wrong and this leads to `m^n / (m! / (m-n)!)` and the result is much worse than I expected: n=100, m=500 requires brute-forcing 40k salts in `keccak256(selector + salt) % m`

I suspect the best solution we have right now for N selectors is the following:
1. Determine M > N for the result table dimension, for example M = N*3/2
2. Bruteforce SALT for `keccak256(concat(selector, SALT)) % M` until all buckets have <=3 elements
3. Use the result as an index in jump table to get into code checking up to 3 selectors in a row

I am trying to compute a number of cases that are suitable for the conditions to compute the probability and complexity of the bruteforcing task.

This conversation reminds me of the dispatcher in Objective-C, which has to solve some similar issues. In Objective-C methods are invoked dynamically by runtime lookup using "selectors" which are themselves essentially based on the function signature. Obviously method dispatch in a raw CPU context vs dispatch in the EVM is very different. However, the dispatcher has been worked on since the 90s and may contain relevant prior art.

Just in case it's of interest, here's where you can find the source code for the message dispatch function:

https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/objc4/tree/main/runtime/Messengers.subproj

Checked the following numbers:
- Number of selectors: **up to 1000**
- Table size: **1.5 * number of selectors**
- Max bucket size: **2**

Hash function:
```js
(selector XOR salt) MOD 65537 MOD m
```

After brute-forcing salts for 10k different sets of 1000 random generated selectors I have the following stats:
- 99th percentile of sets find salt after 11726 iterations
- 95th percentile of sets find salt after 7129 iterations
- 90th percentile of sets find salt after 5343 iterations
- 50th percentile of sets find salt after 1552 iterations

I believe we could use something like this:
```solidity
let ptr := mod(mod(xor(selector, SALT), PRIME), TABLE_SIZE)
codecopy(0, add(TABLE_OFFSET_IN_BYTECODE, mul(ptr, 2)), 2)
jump(shr(240, mload(0)))
```

and on destinations we can have 3 variations:
1. Check 0 combinations
    ```solidity
    mstore(0, UNKNOWN_SELECTOR_ERROR)
    revert(0, 4)
    ```
2. Check 1 combination
    ```solidity
    if eq(selector, SELECTOR_X) {
        jmp(SELECTOR_X_OFFSET_IN_BYTECODE)
    }
    mstore(0, UNKNOWN_SELECTOR_ERROR)
    revert(0, 4)
    ```
3. Check 2 combination
    ```solidity
    if eq(selector, SELECTOR_Y) {
        jmp(SELECTOR_Y_OFFSET_IN_BYTECODE)
    }
    if eq(selector, SELECTOR_Z) {
        jmp(SELECTOR_Z_OFFSET_IN_BYTECODE)
    }
    mstore(0, UNKNOWN_SELECTOR_ERROR)
    revert(0, 4)
    ```

Or we could use the first table to point on 1-2 selectors in the second table. And use 1 code to check these selectors.

Maybe you could introduce the `dispatcher()` function in Solidity in the addition to `receive()` and `fallback()` methods family? Which will be called before and instead of external methods, where Solidity engineers could put their own heavily optimized version of the dispatcher and perform internal calls?

This should be a separate issue for discussion, and I think there are a bunch of overlapping once already.

One (small) downside I see is that in that case a contract could not have any function marked `external` or `public`, as that would indicate those are reachable from the outside, and a result make visual inspection of contracts hard.

This discussion IMHO motivates a set of instructions that expect inputs assumed to come from a certain value distribution (hash based keccak prefix for now) plus well-formed data structures, and emit results ... in this case a computationally efficient lookup. I've been working on non EVM projects for a while now and don't recall, but I don't think the EVM has a "BIOS" and if not, maybe it should have. I.e., "long jumps" into functions that are actually implemented "outside" the EVM in a CPU and gas efficient manner as part of the EVM itself.

Clearly the keccak computation instructions are examples "in that direction"; but there's probably a family of functions that shouldn't require new instruction-set but can be implemented efficiently outside the EVM in a physical CPU efficient manner based on a calling ABI. I.e., an stdlib.

It doesn't make much sense to me that, structurally speaking, either miners or EVM users would want expensive functions like this to run in the most inefficient context possible. I.e. *inside* EVM. I imagine keccak is not run there for precisely the same reasons.

@aathan "precompiled contracts" are effectively accomplishing what you are saying. They were opcodes initially, but moved out to reduce the surface area of the EVM, and keccak256 remained as an opcode because it is "supposed to be used more widely". There is a struggle around these, and I personally am against making the EVM more complicated and more CISC-like, as opposed to introducing useful primitives.

It seems current dispatcher have O(log) execution complexity, but O(n) code size. I think it's possible to have table of function pointers in the code and have O(1) code size for this dispatcher. I discovered that 27 methods dispatcher size is 4Kb, which is pretty huge. WDYT @chriseth @cameel?

Thx for discussing this topic. Please, consider the aspect that not all functions need to be that gas efficient. 

I would rather have a dispatcher with ability to prioritize - e.g. ERC20.transfer() to be jumped with lowest gas overhead, while supportsInterface can have higher gas overhead.

In other words - if a prioritization would help for mentioned bucketing I could foresee the priority flag aside of the public / external function definition.

e.g.:
```
function transfer(address to, uint256 value) external gasPriority(1) returns (bool);

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view gasPriority(5) returns (bool);
```
