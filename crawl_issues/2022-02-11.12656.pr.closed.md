Part of #13718.
~Depends on #14066.~ Merged.
~Depends on #14087.~ Merged.
~Depends on #14104.~ Merged.

## Design
[Literal suffixes - design decisions](https://notes.ethereum.org/62ZGU8OHQw-KimH7inZ-4w)

## TODO
Here's a summary of what's left to do here. Overall not much concrete stuff. Just tons of small things.

### Concrete things to do
- [x] Fix failing command line tests.
- [x] Fix failing external tests.
- [x] Require functions to be declared as a suffix to be recognized as one. Syntax:
    ```solidity
    function km(uint meters) pure suffix returns (uint) {}
    ```
    `suffix` becomes a built-in modifier, usable only on file-level functions but we do not make it a keyword.
- [x] Disallow suffixes with zero or more than one return value.
- [x] Disallow suffixes with storage and calldata return values.
- [x] Disallow signed exponent for decimal suffixes.
- [x] Disallow non-pure functions as suffixes.
    - ~Or fix: `ViewPureChecker` does not complain about mutable/`view` suffixes used inside `view`/`pure` functions.~
- [x] Disallow suffix definitions with parameter types that no literal can be implicitly converted to.
- [x] Suffixed literals should be marked as function calls in the AST.
    - Use a `FunctionCall` node with `isSuffixCall` annotation for suffixed literals (but not for denominations!).
    - ~Replace `isSuffixCall` with a new `CallKind`.~ *It does not look like a good idea after all. We won't be doing it.*
- [x] Include the suffix and new annotation in the AST exporter and importer.
- [x] Allow suffix overloading.
    - [x] Disallow suffix overloading.
        - Done as a follow-up PR #14105.
- [x] Fix: ICE when an integer or decimal with zero fractional part is decomposed into mantissa and exponent.
- [x] String literal handling in the IR codegen.
- [x] Fix: Suffixed values are not disallowed as array sizes even though they're not constants.
- [x] Fix: Suffixes not detected as function calls by control flow graph (no "unreachable code" warning).
- [x] More detailed error message for exponent/mantissa out of range.
- (Optional) ~When no suffix definition found, check if there are any non-suffix definitions and list them in error message.~
- [x] Include suffix definition as a secondary location in errors.
- [x] Warning against missing suffix support in SMTChecker (if needed).
- [x] Grammar update.
- [x] Documentation.
- [x] Changelog.

### Things to check and maybe fix/implement
There are some things that might be already partially or fully working:
- [x] Research syntax variants for marking function declaration usable as a suffix.
- [x] Make sure types other than `uint` in suffixes for rational literals are allowed (both single arg and with mantissa/exponent).
- [x] Make sure our analysis (in particular the function call graph and control flow graph) follows suffixes like other function calls. Where possible, add test coverage.
- [x] Make sure that the `MemberAccess` case is always handled, add test coverage (i.e. suffixes with dots)
- [x] There are a lot of TODOs in the code that need to be reviewed

### Extra test cases
- Syntax tests
    - [x] Suffixing negative values.
    - [x] Suffix overloading.
    - [x] Range of mantissa and exponent, especially with suffixes accepting integer types other than `uint`.
    - [x] Correct parsing of suffixes in ternary operator expressions without parentheses.
    - Invalid cases
        - [x] Suffixed literals are not constants (should not be usable in constant definitions, array declarations, etc.).
        - [x] Suffixing array literals, tuple literals, structs, enums.
        - [x] Suffixing errors and events.
        - [x] Suffix returning a struct containing a mapping.
    - Overloading and shadowing
        - [x] Overloading between `suffix` and non-`suffix` functions.
        - [x] Functions shadowing suffixes and vice-versa.
- Semantic tests
    - [x] Correct return values for all kinds of literals (integers, booleans, decimals, addresses, strings, bytes).
    - [x] Type of literal different from the return type.
    - [x] Suffix use in various places (different types of calls, `new`, indexing, initialization, modifiers, `abi.encode`, etc.)
    - [x] Decomposition into mantissa and exponent.
    - [x] Checked/unchecked suffixes
    - [x] Suffix shadowing a built-in
    - [x] Suffixes making pure/view external calls
    - [x] Suffix return parameter cleanup
    - [x] Recursive suffix application
    - [x] Overloaded suffixes.
    - [x] Values at the edges of supported ranges.
    - [x] Suffixes called `szabo` and `finney` (deprecated denominations).
    - [x] Arbitrary return types.
    - [x] Calling a function pointer returned by a suffix.
- [x] SMTChecker tests

One thing to note about the `1 f` notation (i.e. without `_` between the literal and the suffix) is that we'd have to either add `finney` and `szabo` back to the parser or they'd be now allowed as custom literal suffixes. Someone could define them though not with the same exact semantics (i.e. no arbitrary-precision arithmetic).

I wrote some example code without `_` and it looked really weird, so I would say we should require the `_` both for defining the function and for using it.

@chriseth Actually we need to talk about syntax again because there is a problem with `_`. We use it as a number separator and this makes `_` suffixes ambiguous with hexadecimals. For example:
```solidity
    0x1_000_fff
```
Is this the number `0x1000fff` or `0x1000` with a suffix called `fff`?

user-defined “post-fix operators” vs. user-defined literal suffixes:

I really like using `using` to tie functions to literal suffixes. In my opinion, the following problems still need to be ironed out:

1. the literal suffixes have to be usable for fractional literals. Those do not have a type. We added a mechanism to call the function with to arguments. A potential solution could be to either only use the using statement to declare a function being a literal suffix without specifying the type (`usign f as suffix;`) or have some special words to denote the different kind of literals (`using f as string suffix; using f as int suffix; using f as fractional suffix;`)
2. Suffixes usually have short names and thus easily clash with other identifiers. Because of that (and also to avoid confusion), it might be useful to disallow referencing (and thus calling) such a function in a regular context, i.e. disallow `m(1)`, but only allow `1 m`. In this example, just writing `m` would result in an "identifier not found" error. The added complication here is that if the effect of `using f as int suffix;` is that `f` is not available as stand-alone identifier, how does the reference to `f` work inside the `using` statement? Maybe we can make an exception to that rule for `using` statements....

I like the variant with `fractional suffix`.

Maybe we can make an exception to that rule for `using` statements....

So you would like to support functions and literal suffixes with the same name? e.g. `m(1)` is allowed, if there was a function e.g. `m(uint256)` defined. Where suffixes are only allowed to be used as suffixes `1 m`? `m(1)` will be always forbidden, if only defined as user-defined suffix (no matching function e.g. `m(uint256)`).

However, not sure  what `using` restrictions actually apply here. I don't fully understand the restriction with `f` is not available as stand-alone identifier. I think that this should at least work, when `f` was defined as a file-level function, right?

We always have to think about this as being used across files. One file defined the suffix, another file uses it. The using file should explicitly import it. If we just say `import m from "x.sol";`, then we should be able to reference `m` by just writing `m`. But if we allow that, it blocks any other identifier called `m` - this is what we want to avoid.

For future reference, if needed:
I have been trying to isolate the problematic code in the external tests. 
I chose `ens` because it is the faster to fail. First, I tried to check if our shell script could print the name of files being compiled, but that is not possible directly. I am not sure if hardhat can do that and then instead I just tried erasing the whole `contracts` folder (created in a temp location, like `/tmp/ext-test-ENS-.../`, by our script) and starting with a minimal set of files that could compile without errors. Next, I started adding folders until I got to two interdependent ones which generate a compiler exception: `wrapper` and `ethregistrar`. These have around 30 files, to which I was going to apply the same methodology in the hopes of finding which is the problematic one and then finally be able to isolate the offending block of code. These files reference other projects, so I am not sure if the problem is really here.
Maybe there's a better, easier way to do this, but atm that's what I can do straightforwardly without having to detour and dive deeper into the tools like `hardhat`.

@matheusaaguiar Surprisingly, removing the codegen refactor did not make the assert failure in external tests go away (unless it's just a different assert failing now). So we still need to get to the bottom of it after all.

Also, a faster way to isolate it might be to try passing individual top-level files to `solc`. As long as you use the `--include-path` option to point at the dependencies, files should generally compile and you should be able to isolate the one that is failing. Then find the spot by cutting out imports.

I managed to identify what file and what code causes an assertion to fail, in the `ens` external test.
The file is `contracts/wrapper/NameWrapper.sol` and the problem seems to be with function `_canTransfer` at line `607` which overrides a `virtual` function from another contract.
The file is inside the `tmp` folder generated by our test script. Running the following command from the `contracts` folder, reproduces the problem:
`solc --base-path . --include-path ../node_modules/ ./wrapper/NameWrapper.sol --optimize --via-ir`

It makes this assertion fail: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c6cc2e4d8198b7b1c0d8a35824eb34c4aefb56bf/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp#L1073

@matheusaaguiar Thanks, that was enough to track it down!

Turns out that the problem is caused by a virtual function that gets overridden with another function that's not exactly identical (`view` rather than mutable). I've got a repro:

```solidity
abstract contract A {
    function f() internal {
        v();
    }

    function v() internal virtual;
}

contract C is A {
    function test() public {
        f();
    }

    function v() internal view override {}
}
```

My assumption was that the types must be identical and this proves it wrong. I'll need to adjust it.

But also good that now we have a test for it. Apparently external tests do that a lot and we did not have even one test case covering it.

@ekpyron This is now ready for review.

Current status:
- I extracted small bits into separate PRs. Only the second one is a dependency here.
    - #14103
    - #14104
- There are a few smal leftovers from the checklist above that I decided to do in separate PRs:
    - The PR allows overloading. I still think we should not disallow it, but I prepared a follow-up PR that would do it: #14105.
    - @matheusaaguiar is working on the SMTChecker part (just a warning and tests, not full support).
    - Documentation.
    - Refactor to add a new `CallKind` instead of `isSuffixCall` annotation.

I updated #14105 to use the method suggested by @chriseth and it does work, though IMO error messages are very suboptimal. I think we'd still be better off handling that case specially and issuing a better message (which requires the `m_currentFunctionCall` hack).

It works so I added the changes from that PR here. Overloading is now disallowed.

Never pay for minorly improved error messages by majorly increased code complexity, it's not worth it - the error messages here will be perfectly fine.

I dealt with all the comments and also added some minor tweaks (mostly tests, but also things like mentioning location in error message for reference types).

Also note that the docs are ready for review in #14121.

EDIT: SMTChecker support is done in #14118 and also can be merged into this PR when approved.

Also is one of the refactors from the parent issue is in #14124, but note that it's independent of suffixes and the suffix PR can be merged without it.

In general, you can safely focus only on [suffix PRs with the `roadmap` label](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aroadmap+suffix).
