## Abstract

The methods `send` and `transfer` were introduced only for `address payable` with the intention to explicitly differentiate the addresses that can be sent Ether. But these two methods are now being [discouraged](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/) in the Solidity community, in favor of `call`.

But, currently, the `call` can be invoked successfully on both non-payable `address` and payable `address payable` types with some value set. For example, it is perfectly valid to send `someone` (`address` type) some Ether by invoking `sendSomeone()` method in the following `Dummy` contract:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Dummy {
    address someone = 0xAb8...cb2;

    function balanceOf(address addr) public view returns (uint) {
        return addr.balance;
    }

    function sendToSomeone() public payable returns (bool) {
        (bool sent, ) = someone.call{value: msg.value}("");
        return sent;
    }
}
```

## Motivation

Apart from defeating the original intention of differentiating `address` and `address payable`, the current behavior of `call` might introduce potential bugs or even security flaws by mistaken invocation of `call` on an address that wasn't even supposed to be payable. Changing the behavior of `call` in different contexts will further enforce the security in the contract.

## Specification

A possible solution is the different behavior of `call` for `address` and `address payable` types.

For `address payable` it should work as it works now. No changes.

But for a plain `address` type it should not compile if it is invoked with `value` param set. So, if `call` is invoked on `someAddr` of `address` type it won't compile:
```solidity
someAddr.call{value: 10000000}("");  // Error: Invalid!
```

However, it should be good if there is no value param:
```solidity
someAddr.call{gas: 1000000}("");  // This is fine!
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This change will not be fully backward compatible as currently `call` is allowed with `value` set and the proposed solution asks to prohibit it.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
