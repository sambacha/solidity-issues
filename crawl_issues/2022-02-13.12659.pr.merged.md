### What's in this PR
Closes #12442

This PR adds test cases for a `Base64` implementation inspired by [OpenZepplin's implementation.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2884/files)

It adds two test cases, `base64_inline_asm` and `base64_no_inline_asm` to assist in optimizer improvement.

I added assertions to replicate the test vectors specified in the [RFC4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-10) to ensure both implementations are to specification.

### What's left?

#### Organization
This is my first time contributing, so I don't have strong feelings towards the way I've organized the code. Perhaps it makes more sense to fold both implementations into the one base file as opposed to introduce a different one for each implementation. Happy to defer to someone with expertise.

@paarthmadan thanks for the PR!
Some of the CI tests are failing with "Compiling contract failed". Can you please check the errors by clicking on `Details` on the failing CI tests at the end of this page?

Parts of the CI failures are missing gas expectations - you can run ``isoltest --optimize`` to have the required gas expecations generated automatically (note that they will only be added if the gas usage is beyond ``100000`` gas, so if you want gas expectations for the runtime calls, you may need to use larger strings).

If we want to get proper runtime numbers, I think we need to encode more data. This does not have to be given explicitly, it can also  be generated e.g. in a loop in the solidity code.
What do you think, @cameel ?

@chriseth I've added two functions which perform encode N number of times (arbitrarily chosen to be 100). This provides proper runtime numbers for each of the approaches, and accentuates the advantage of using the inline assembly optimization in the current state of the optimizer (which was the original intent of this change).

I've made some minor adjustments to ensure CI is green.
