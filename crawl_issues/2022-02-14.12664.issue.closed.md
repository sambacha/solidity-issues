In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12662 I disabled running smt tests in ubsan nightly test runs. They were already disabled in asan runs.

The reason is that we get memory leaks in Z3/spacer.

We should still investigate these leaks eventually, respectively instead of adding ``--no-smt`` to the test runs, selectively disable reports from spacer-allocated memory.

I'm also not sure if linking against the gcc-compiled static z3 library in these clang-based test runs is sane, so we can also see what happens if we use a clang-based static z3 build instead.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
