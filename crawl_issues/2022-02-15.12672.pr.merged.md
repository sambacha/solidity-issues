In combination with #12206 it does address the issue, but it might also need some more careful tuning of the inlining parameters to make this always work.

Maybe it would be good if you could check the test coverage? :)

Yeah, my plan was to look into that some more tomorrow in any case.

Because I was curious: That's an external test benchmark diff between develop and this (although this PR may not be rebased precisely, so the comparison may be slightly off): https://gist.github.com/ekpyron/2af0bea5b23282caffa2d2da43b88d75
Which seems to indicate that without more aggressive inlining and/or dropping the restriction to constants only, this doesn't work extremely well in practice - but regardless it's a good first step.

The fuzzer complains that the `mstore` in the following test is optimized out and hence the `sstore` only stores zero at the said location.

```
{
  mstore(2, 0x10000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
  pop(
    call(
      0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      0x10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,
      0,
      0x10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    )
  )
  sstore(0x100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, mload(2))
}

Oh, wow... that's right :-)!

The PR assumes that the ``call`` overrides the full output area, but we cannot assume that! Basically we have to assume that it may also just write nothing at all.

Kudos to the fuzzer, this would have been a pretty harsh bug!

~Another~ failing test case(s) reported by the fuzzer


##### staticcall

```
{
  mstore(0x9f, 0xa0)
  return(staticcall(0xa1, 0xff, 0x100, 0x101, 0x10, 0x100), 0x1000)
}
```

The `mstore` is incorrectly optimized because staticcall may not actually overwrite `0x9f`.

##### calldatacopy

```
{
  function foo_m_0() -> x_1, x_2
  {
    sstore(0, mload(2))
  }
  mstore(0, 42)
  calldatacopy(0, 0x3fff, 1)
  let x_7, x_8 := foo_m_0()
}
```

`calldatacopy` is optimized out.

Why is it incorrect to optimize out calldatacopy?
After inlining we get
```
{
  mstore(0, 42)
  calldatacopy(0, 0x3fff, 1)
  sstore(0, mload(2))
}
```
the calldatacopy copies a single byte to location `0`, but the `mload` only reads starting from `2`, so I don't think the calldatacopy is needed.

Yup, this is a false positive due to the way the Yul interpreter silently ignores certain writes to memory (which consequently affects loads from memory)

The fuzzer reported the following trace divergence (mstore optimized out and hence the keccak256 call returns a different value)

```
{
  mstore(add("z",iszero(0x9f)), 0xa0)
  sstore(0xa1, 0xff)
  sstore(0x100, 0x101)
  sstore(keccak256("z",0x10), 0x100)
}
```

@bshastry Actually, the ``keccak256`` seems to be evaluated even before this PR... so this resolves to
```
{
            mstore("z", 0xa0)
            sstore(0xa1, 0xff)
            let _1 := 0x100
            sstore(_1, 0x101)
            sstore(110620294328144418057589324861608220015688365608948720310623173341503153578932, _1)
}
```
after which the ``mstore`` is really redundant and *can* be removed...

and it's actually correct - we know the value stored in memory at ``"z"`` is ``0x00...00a0``, so the first ``0x10`` bytes are all zero and the big constant should be the keccak256 hash of 16 zeroes...

So it may be a false positive, but I'm not sure where it's coming from... maybe the interpreter (that's what you use as reference, right?) calculates the keccak hash incorrectly?

Ah, the yul interpreter doesn't interpret reads and writes from high memory addresses, does it?
``EVMInstructionInterpreter::accessMemory`` looks like it only allows access up to ``numeric_limits<size_t>::max() - 0xffff``...

And because of that ``EVMInstructionInterpreter::eval`` returns the bogus ``return u256("0x1234cafe1234cafe1234cafe") + arg[0];`` in L185 - and won't get the keccak value right... I think that's it...

Not sure if there's good reason to restrict the interpreter to only low memory accesses... maybe it should be a setting...
