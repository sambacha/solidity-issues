# [\#12673 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12673) `merged`: Bypass an expiration check in ElementFi until it's fixed upstream
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-02-15 11:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12673):

A workaround for https://github.com/element-fi/elf-contracts/issues/243.

ElementFi test suite uses forked mainnet (so `block.timestamp` is 2021-08-15) and then uses an expiration time of half a year in one of the tests. This is too short as of yesterday and started failing: [`t_native_test_ext_elementfi`](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/975855). Until this is fixed, I'm disabling the check.
