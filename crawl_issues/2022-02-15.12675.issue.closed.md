## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html

## Abstract

There is nothing that references the immutable variable style guides. 

Should it follow the syntax of `CONSTANTS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` or `camelCase`?

Thank you. Added to project board at https://github.com/users/fulldecent/projects/2/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Repository%22%5D

And will follow back here.

This is prioritized as "new opinions" which is below "broken things".

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
