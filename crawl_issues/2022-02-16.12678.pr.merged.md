# [\#12678 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12678) `merged`: Fix: remove lower_case_with_underscores and Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`, `style guide`

The style guide specifically calls for the use of `mixedCase` (aka camelCase) when naming functions, function arguments, local and state variables, and modifiers.

We acknowledge that the style guide does not specifically forbid the use of lower_case_with_underscores and Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores, the style guide is based on PEP-8 (and Python does use snake_case) and further more that many users enjoy using snake_case.

However, if for no other reason than consistency, we should avoid using those style in the code examples throughout the documentation, and for the most part we do.

This pr removes the use of lower_case_with_underscores and Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores in all .rst files and references to those cases in the style guide.

Documenting that the motivation for this PR are existing rules that we agree are sound:

Please rename issue to:

> Fix: remove lower_case_with_underscores and Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores

Because this PR does NOT remove SNAKE_CASE, which is still being kept for constants.

I still see these which are not fixed yet:

- assembly.rst

If that is fixed, I see that this PR comprehensively fixes the issue across the repo.

I performed my review using:

```perl
m/\b[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*_[a-zA-Z0-9]/
```

@devtooligan thanks for the contribution!
It looks like some of the changed code doesn't compile. One of the CI tests will try to compile all the documentation examples as part of the command line tests, and that's currently failing.
You can click on `Details` next to a failing test at the end of this page to see what exactly is failing.
To reproduce it locally you can run from the repo root: `./test/cmdlineTests.sh`

@leonardoalt Thanks for pointing that out. I fixed a typo that fixed all the tests except for one, but I'm not sure how that one is related to my .rst file changes.

bthe remaining failing test is an external contract test calling a yield contract.

If the o means output, please just change to "output" and proceed with camel case. 

Single letter variables are dangerous. Especially O, as we have already documented.

@devtooligan It's unrelated to your PR. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12685. This has already been fixed and the job will pass if you rebase on latest `develop`.

This is a part of our external tests - a CI setup where we build a set of selected Solidity projects with the compiler binary compiled with changes from the PR. Recently I added a few new projects to these tests, including Yield Liquidator (#12530).

What fails here is our sanity check that ensures that all build artifacts inside project directory were actually built using the compiler versions we're testing. If there are any from other versions, the test script is supposed to remove them so that they're forced to be rebuilt. In this case the check found some new ones in `@uniswap-v3` and the script needed to be adjusted. I think that Yield either must have added a dependency on Uniswap periphery only a few days ago or Uniswap did not have these artifacts before and started including them now.

> If the o means output, please just change to "output" and proceed with camel case. 

I think it's just our C++ coding style leaking into the Solidity examples. For us in C++ `o_` means "output parameter", `io_` means "input/ouptut parameter", `m_` means "class member". Ordinary function parameters are prefixed with `_`. To be honest, the `o_` and `io_` prefixes did not catch up in the C++ codebase anyway so you'll rarely see them there. These Solidity examples must be pretty old :)

Not sure if replacing `o_` with `output` is necessary. You'll probably want to remove these prefixes altogether. I'm just saying that they come from a different rule. Most of these variables actually follow camel case and only the prefix has an underscore.

@cameel Thanks for that great explanation about the failing test.  And yes, I believe we did recently change some dependecies around univ3-periphery.

@cameel @fulldecent Is your preference that I `git rebase` and `git push -f` as opposed to merging the latest `develop` branch into mine?

As far as the `o_` variable naming issue, it sounds like @fulldecent would like to remove the `o_` in order to be consistent and avoid confusion.  @cameel agrees and is suggesting a slightly different fix of removing the prefix altogether.  I'm going to just remove the prefixes unless @fulldecent has a strong opinion to the contrary

We use rebase workflow so please, no merge commits in feature branches :) `git rebase -i develop` and then `git push --force-with-lease`.

@devtooligan Once you're done, please squash your commits. It does not have to be a single commit but each one should be a single logical change, without going back and forth. We usually fixup any changes requested in a PR into the original commits. This gives more readable history.
