A maximum line length of 79 characters is antiquated.  Github allows 140 character widths and etherscan shows 233 characters when displaying verified contracts.  

We should suggest a maximum of 120 and we can still reference the PEP8's maximum allowed 99 characters.

This is a good suggestion. But I recommend that we please table this discussion until all less controversial work is completed.

Please mark PR as "DRAFT" in GitHub.

@fulldecent any update on the pre-conditions for this PR?

@Marenz Yes. The precondition is satisfied. All the lesser "slam dunk" issues are handled. Now is a good time to consider this.

Here is some review from high quality projects in the wild.

- OpenZeppelin currently prefers 120 characters: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/.prettierrc
- Solmate prefers 120: https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/main/.prettierrc
- Seaport prefers 80 https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/main/.prettierrc.js

---

Based on this review I support this PR's intention.

The PEP reference can probably be removed.

@devtooligan would you like to please unmark this as draft?

# Follow on work

After this is merged maybe we can also add a note at bottom of style guide showing linter configurations to support our style guide. It's not complete. But it it is at least correct for its limited scope, and we can improve it more later.

.solhint.json

```
{
  "rules": {
    "max-line-length": ["error",120]
  }
}
```

prettier.json

```
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "*.sol",
      "options": {
        "printWidth": 120
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

.editorconfig

```
[*.sol]
max_line_length = 120
```

I think this needs one rebase to fix the external test

statistical  analysis has determined 100 to be the one true value covering 80% of contracts

Let's stick to 120. 

I do NOT support changing the value to 100, despite personally using it.

I don't want to break the conventions of the most used Solidity codebases.

Of course if you do statistical analysis, the mean is 100.

I suppose statistically relevant would be not the mean but the median in this context?
