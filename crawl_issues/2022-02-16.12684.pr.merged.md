I think this can still be simplified. I'll take another look on Monday!

Would be nice if you could take a look here @cameel  - this adds a slight gas increase for the regular case (due to the `returnSize := min(returnSize, returndatasize())` but protects against some special case of "gas abuse" by called contracts. Can you confirm this is actually worth it? :)

@chriseth Sure, I'll check the benchmarks and let you know.

I wonder where the differences in legacy come from. It's possible that the test suites are just not deterministic.

For example some input values might be randomly generated on the fly by the test suite. Getting a smaller value (with fewer zeros) for an external call can decrease the call cost since zero bytes in calldata are cheaper.

Well, in the few cases where we can get runtime gas usage for optimized IR in external projects, the difference is minimal or zero so in that regard it seems worth it.

On the other hand, bytecode size increases as much as 1.3% for some projects so not great if they're already struggling to stay under bytecode size limit.

I think we should still add this.

I'd have added a changelog entry for this one...

I assumed it does not need one because it's IR. But you're right, I think we decided recently to start adding them. @nishant-sachdeva can you add it in a new PR?

What version was this released in? It still isn't in the changelog.

It was released in 0.8.13. Looks like we did not add it to the changelog in the end.

@chriseth Should we actually add it now? We don't usually modify old changelogs but maybe it would make sense to do it here?

#13307 adds the changelog entry.
