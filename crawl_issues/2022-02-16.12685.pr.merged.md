# [\#12685 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12685) `merged`: Neutralize packaged Uniswap contracts in yield-liquidator external test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-02-16 12:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12685):

[`t_native_test_ext_yield_liquidator` job](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/22275/workflows/853f6bee-755e-45c4-a089-a5ee256c5a9f/jobs/977631) is failing:

```
Verify that the correct version (0.8.12/0.8.12-ci.2022.2.16+commit.f00d7308.Linux.g++) of the compiler was used to compile the contracts...
Wrong compiler version detected in ./node_modules/@uniswap/v3-periphery/artifacts/build-info/058253c6bdb3c3ee13532b82174ce36d.json.
```

The issue is that the project now apparently pulls in `@uniswap/v3-periphery`, which comes with prebuilt Hardhat artifacts. We want to be 100% everything is build from scratch using the latest compiler so have a check that detects them and fails. Deleting them resolves the problem.
