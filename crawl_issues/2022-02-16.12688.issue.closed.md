The binary search for the function dispatch seems to be only implemented in the legacy codegen.

Context:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/da50176b1ffec4444996cb4551e6a78f99bd2990/libsolidity/codegen/ContractCompiler.cpp#L325

Implement the same for the IR based codegen.

I would prefer binary search (or constant-time search) to be implemented for all switch statements instead of writing custom code for the external dispatch. This has the advantage that it 1) can use jumps because it will be in the evm code gen and 2) it automatically applies to the external and the internal dispatch.

I'm not sure this is possible for constant-time search without a special case for external dispatch. The last developments in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12650 make use of the fact that selectors are already random, so re-hashing is not needed. This will not be true of an arbitrary `switch` statement.

While that is true, we can still try. Since the case values are compile-time constants, we will know if it failed or not.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
