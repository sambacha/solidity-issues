fixes #12621

ASTJson test variants are generated based on JSON file availability. Then they are validated against "failAfter" marker in a solidity source file. If the "failAfter" marker is not here all generated test variants are accepted. Otherwise, compiler state in test variant  is compared against "failAfter" marker. If it is later in compilation steps order, the test is interrupted with exception.

I squashed commits and rebased them on the top of the develop branch. 
@Marenz @cameel @chriseth do you see anything that needs to be addressed before we merge?

What will happen, if I add ``failAfter: Parsed`` to a test, but it still has the old expectation file?
Or conversely, what will happen if ``failAfter: Parsed`` is present, but no ``_parseOnly`` file is present?
It might in general help if the PR description explained the intended new logic.

To me it would seem that, ideally, the solidity source file fully determines what variants are expected with its settings and a run of ``isoltest`` will verify that the appropriate expectation files are there and *only* those - and error out specifically if the set of expectation files doesn't match... but from a quick glance, it looks like the PR runs variants based on which files are present?

But I may have missed some discussion on this.

@ekpyron Yes, the idea was to run variants based on which files are present. I am not sure if we can depend on *.sol file only. In fail_after_parsing test we expect a compilation fail after parsing. But even so, in the second test variant, a result AST is enriched by "exportedSymbols". Do you think the second variant makes not sense?

I don't think there is any way to make the compiler output an AST on the ``fail_after_parsing`` test without specifying ``--stop-after parsing`` (which will lead to the ``_parseOnly`` AST). So the second variant does not really make sense - it just tests some partial intermediate result that will never actually occur anywhere.

Thank you for the quick response! It is all clear now. I will update code to validate the test variants based on the "failAfter" marker.

@ekpyron I updated PR with JSONs/variants validation. Please let me know if this is what you expected to see.
