Related to #10329.

This is a bunch of tweaks to make wasm rebuild scripts work again. This is only the minimal change I need to build v0.5.17. It uses the original emscripten image used in the rebuilds ([`trzeci/emscripten:sdk-tag-1.39.3-64bit`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/trzeci/emscripten/sdk-tag-1.39.3-64bit/images/sha256-e21b86e327cae16f3428916e09368fc29e78b4cdc22de340670479712477b6f9)), which is a bit outdated by now.

I tried to switch to the buildpack image we're using now but this turned out to be non-trivial. I managed to solve some of the issues but the blocker is that each compiler release has options for emscripten hard-coded in [`EthCompilerSettings.cmake`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake). We kept updating them as we were switching to newer emscripten versions but older releases still have the old options. So getting it to work requires patching the source, possibly in a different way for different releases. An additional problem is that some of the changed options might also be associated with some changes in compiler sources and those would also need to be pulled in from later releases. This then comes with the risk of breaking things in a way that will not be apparent until someone tries to use it in some specific environment, like a browser.

Overall this is definitely solvable but more work than I want to spend on it right now. So in the end I went with building it with older emscripten. The biggest downside is that the binary won't be compressed as in #12265 and will not be affected by any emscripten config tweaks we might have introduced after 0.5.17. I pushed what I managed to do to the [`modernize-wasm-rebuild`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/modernize-wasm-rebuild) branch and left it at that.

One thing I still want to salvage is to make wasm rebuild use the newer bytecode compare setup I have prepared for solc-bin PR check. This will be a separate PR though.
