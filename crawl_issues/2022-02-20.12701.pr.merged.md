# [\#12701 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12701) `merged`: Fix running path-related tests from any Windows drive
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Currently a couple of tests expect the temp directory and the current working directory to be located on the same drive.

As a result, in a popular Windows setup when the system is installed on `C:` (so the default temp directory is on `C:`) and projects are on `D:`, these tests fail.

This PR adjusts the test expectations.

(I'm not fully satisfied though. In an ideal case we would need to run tests from different drives. But I am not even sure if our Windows CI has `D:`, and if that corner case worth the troubles.)

LGTM, but better get a second reviewer

Yeah, thoroughly testing stuff that relies on real system-specific locations (Windows drives and UNC in particular) is really problematic. I don't have a good solution and, to be honest, even what we have is a bit heavy for how little actual code it's testing. I.e. most of the corner cases really come from Boost and the FS and not our code and what we're really testing are our assumptions about these things.

I think CI does have more than one drive actually and it's also possible to create new drives with `subst` command. Even so, assuming that we have enough permissions to write there or that we can safely create temp files there without overwriting anything is a bit risky. This stuff is too invasive so I'd prefer not to go that route. I think that adjustments from this PR are good enough.

If this is just a refactoring for production code, then please merge. Otherwise, change the title of the pull request and add a changelog entry.

Yes, just a refactor. Actual logic changes only in tests.
