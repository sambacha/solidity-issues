If Ninja is used a CMake generator, it is not possible to build Solidity due to an error `bad $-escape (literal $ must be written as $$)`.

For now I just set this PR as draft until we solved the underlying problem correctly: somehow cmake seem not to evaluate the generator expression correctly, if ninja is used - ninja should never see these `$`.

I changed this PR with the fix suggested by @chfast.

BTW, I recommend using Ninja on CI. It is much more pedantic than Makefiles.

I was actually thinking the same! I will bring that up in a next meeting. Thx @chfast!

Using ninja sounds fine to me. The change should be pretty transparent, I don't think we rely on Makefiles in any major way (other than in this expression by accident). We should keep some jobs on makefiles though just to make sure it still works.

IMHO the "proper" solution for this would be to not use ``add_compile_option`` ever at all, but to use explicit ``INTERFACE`` targets, equip them with the compiler options using ``target_compile_options`` and explicitly link them to our other targets (except evmc, which we can handle separately, resp. with a shared set of C-compatible options in another interface target - I think evmc has the only C files we compile).
The idea of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12515 was, among others, to do just that...

What's the conclusion here?
