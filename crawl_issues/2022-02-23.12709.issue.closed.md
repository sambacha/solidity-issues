Hello everyone, my smart contract runs normally on ganache and the public test network, but in the private chain built by myself, it always prompts gas required exceeds allowance (8000000)

This does not look like a problem in the compiler to me. Your contract probably just exceeds the gas limit you specified yourself in the transaction (i.e. 8000000 gas). What specifically makes you think it's a compiler bug?

By the way, please don't post code and errors as screenshots. This forces anyone who'd like to help you to retype all that code to reproduce your problem.

Closing this as "not related to the compiler". If you think otherwise, please reopen.
