# [\#12714 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12714) `merged`: Remove outdated release scripts

I think these scripts have not been touched since they were added back in #770, apart from small syntax tweaks and cleanup. They no longer match our release process - we're releasing static binaries on all platforms as single files - and I doubt anyone is using them.

Reposting answers from the chat so that this info is discoverable later:

@cameel 
> Nothing, really. I think these scripts were needed just to package the executable and all the required shared libs into a single zip.
> For most platforms that happened long ago, before I even joined the project. Only Windows was a bit late to the party, which is why [in solc-bin we have zips for windows up to 0.7.1](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/windows-amd64).
> At some point we have switched to building completely static binaries and that's already a single file per platform.
> So just like the [checklist says](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReleaseChecklist.md#download-binaries), you grab a binary from CircleCI artifact page and that's it. No need for additional packaging.
