# [\#12715 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12715) `merged`: Put source tarball creation instructions back on the release checklist

This bit was removed in #10000, apparently because Travis was uploading the source package automatically. Since then we have retired Travis and in #11282 we have removed a reference to it from the checklist but without adding an alternative.

We're still publishing the source packages (thought hopefully not for long - #9720) so I'm assuming @chriseth went back to building and publishing them manually. If that is the case, these steps should be put back on the list.
