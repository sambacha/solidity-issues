# [\#12716 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12716) `merged`: Don't set locale used by C++ stdlib to the value from `LC_ALL` env variable even if it's valid

fixes #12350

From the description in #674 it looks to me like the reporter had the locale variables in his system set to a locale that was not enabled (i.e. not present or commented-out in `/etc/locale.gen`). The thing I'm not 100% sure about is why it affected solc at all. `setlocale()` docs say that the stdlib does `setlocale(LC_ALL, "C")` at startup, which means that it should completely ignore the locale env vars - so why would invalid locale name in these vars do anything?

The only way I can explain this is that something else down the line tries to use these env variables and fails. Could be Boost or maybe we're spawning a Bash process at some point to run a shell command? If that's the case, it would explain why `setenv()` added by #975 helped - this way we reset the locale variable inherited by the solc process to "C" if its value is invalid. This means that whatever tries to use that variable, now never has to deal with an invalid value.

I hate to be guessing here and given that this locale problem was lurking for several years, I think we should verify that the solution is correct. We need a test that would detect **both** #12350 and #674. This might not be the easiest task if you're not familiar with our CI and scripts so I just tried to create one myself. Here's my [`locale-test`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/locale-test) branch. It adds a test script and a CI job that runs it. I'm not submitting it as a PR because it of course fails on `develop` - it detects the problem with the Turkish locale. Please cherry-pick commits from it into your branch and then:
1) Make sure that after your fix it passes.
2) Try removing the `setenv()` line to verify that the test is effective against #674 - if it does not fail after that, the test needs to be improved. If you can't make it fail, it might indicate that we don't really need the `setenv()`.

Just for reference, here's [a failing run of my new `t_ubu_locale` job](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/22448/workflows/709f21c2-45cd-4c27-bca6-daab095e62d9/jobs/985548), which shows that it at least detects the problem from #12350 on `develop.`

Oh, one more thing. This fixes a user-visible bug so you should add a new entry in the [changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md) under "Bugfixes".

@cameel  Thank you for your tests! They cover all scenarios I carried out in my local environment. Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce #674 and neither your tests are. "setenv" removal does not change anything in this matter (seems we can remove it).

Regardless of the above, your guessing sounds reasonable to me. I think, the problem might be related to the dependency we no longer use (e.g. particular version of boost or other library). This could explain why we cannot reproduce it.

I would actually be happier if we could find a way to somehow set an "illegal" locale so that we get an error whenever we perform a locale-dependent operation (and of course remove all locale-dependent operations).

Yeah. would be nice if we could detect locale-dependent code. I think that there might be a lot of such code though (pretty much everything related to capitalization for example) so I'd treat it as a separate issue.

Also, does it really fix the issue? It only fixes it in one binary...
I think we really need to find all those locale-dependent functions. I don't think there are too many, by the way.

@chriseth We only use `setlocale()` in this one binary. I saw in history that we used to have it in LLL binary too and also in some other binaries from related repos from before the move to `ethereum/solidity` but that's it. We don't set locale in `yul-phaser` and `solidity-upgrade` for example.

> I think we really need to find all those locale-dependent functions. I don't think there are too many, by the way.

I just checked and you're right in a way, we have only a handful of calls to `tolower()`, `toupper()` and `isprint()` so that part is simple, but I think there are quite a few more things that depend on locale. Doesn't even `std::string` depend on that for some operations? And what about Boost? For me it's more about uncertainty so I'd prefer to see this PR wrapped up, and a new one opened with a clean state where we can deal with it as a separate problem.

I would prefer both be implemented :)
string is not locale-aware, I think it's really mostly the upper/lower functions and maybe case-insensitive regular expressions, but I doubt we us ethem.

Ah, I was thinking about `std::locale` but I see that's independent of `std::setlocale()` (and not global).

By the way, the docs for `setlocale()` have a nice list of functions affected by the global state it manages: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12720#issuecomment-1054485424. That's over 40 different functions. ~20 if you don't count the ones meant for wide chars.

@wechman Can you switch it to non-draft and squash the fixup commit?

> The script should be adjusted not to create temp files in the working dir. Other than that the PR is fine.

Ok, script updated. I already squashed all commits and rebased on the newest develop.
