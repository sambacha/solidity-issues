Approach looks good. We need to change all the code that reads those files and query the information from git if the contents contain placeholders.

Maybe we can even execute a git command to do the replacement (of course not modify the files)?

Not sure if job failures are even related to the PR. There were some CircleCI problems yesterday to I reran it to make sure. It looks like CircleCI had some problems executing the bash code in the config. If it's reproducible, could also be that they changed something in their API/config format but that seems unlikely to me.

@nishant-sachdeva Does this replace the placeholders only when you explicitly run `git archive` or every time the code is checked out (would be nice to actually have a comment explaining that in the code)? If it's the former, you'll need to look through everything that reads these two files and manually tell either git to generate them before hand or just treat it as if the files did not exist.

It'll only replace the placeholders on ``git archive``, so yes: we will need to change the logic when reading those files, in particular ``cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake``.

If the files do not contain placeholders, we can assume that it's a release tarball and use the commit hash from the file.

The tricky part will be the case, in which the files do contain placeholders: we will probably need to check if there is a release tag at the current commit to be able to tell, if we should build as prerelease or as release. EDIT: ah right - or we can inspect the top of the changelog instead as suggested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9720.

Using ``$Format:%d$`` is probably too error-prone.
I think we may need to replace the ``prerelease.txt`` mechanism entirely and instead have something like a ``date.txt`` file plus checking the changelog for ``unreleased`` (unless someone comes up with something better).

Is there are way for git to create the files during `git archive`? There would be fewer changes needed if they did not exist by default. Or they could exist but under a different name, like `prerelease.txt.template` or something.

Would that really help that much? In any case, I think the only thing you can do is to *exclude* files from ``git archive``, which is not much help for our case.

The only complicated part I really see for this is to determine whether we're at a release tag on a git checkout.

Or put differently: for the commit hash this is straightforward, but the prerelease/release logic we will basically have to rewrite for this no matter what.

I think it would. As I see it, the issue is all about source archives created by github. If these files were created only on `git archive`, we'd have proper source archives and keep everything working as it used to in other cases. We'd not have to worry that the files may exist but still contain the template. So we'd be done here already.

The file `commit_hash.txt` is still mentioned in the cmake file further down. Please do full search for "commit_hash" of the whole repository.

As for build errors, please look carefully through the log. The error is there, just not at the very bottom (probably because of the parallel compilation):

```
CMake Error at cmake/scripts/buildinfo.cmake:24 (message):
  The usage of the file prerelease.txt is no longer supported.  Please use
  SOL_FORCE_RELEASE option if you want to build a release executable or
  SOL_PRERELEASE_STRING if you want to adjust the pre-release part of the
  version string.
```

So it looks like we still have `prerelease.txt` there. Please check what is creating it and why. I think it's probably the `build.sh` script that was not correctly updated and does not use the new cmake options yet.

I think it's easier to redo this properly at some point rather than keeping this PR alive, so I'm closing for now.
