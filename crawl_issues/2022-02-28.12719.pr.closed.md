Hi,

This adds:
- Proof logging using FRAT, see https://github.com/digama0/frat
- All clauses are at least 2-long
- tristate value of variables is now an enum, with a vector, rather than a map, for fast lookup -- O(1) lookup instead of O(log(n))
- Binary that can parse a DIMACS input and generate the solution + proof

Example:
```
$ cat a.cnf 
p cnf 2 4
1 2 0
-1 -2 0
1 -2 0
-1 2 0
$ ./satsolver a.cnf proof.frat 
====
(x0, x1)
(~x0, ~x1)
(x0, ~x1)
(~x0, x1)
====
Propagating.
[...]
 - Propagate resulted in conflict because x1 is also false.
Unsatisfiable
s UNSATISFIABLE
$ ./frat-rs fratchk proof.frat 
4 orig + 6 added - 4 deleted - 6 finalized = 0
6 missing proofs (100.0%)
type 0: 6
matesoos@tiresias:tools$ echo $?
0
```

Hence, `frat-rs` verified our proof. Notice that the lines starting with `o` in `proof.frat` MUST match the input CNF, which they do (except for 1st element, which is simply an arbitrary clause ID):
```
$ grep "^o" proof.frat | cut -d " " -f 3-
1 2 0
-1 -2 0
1 -2 0
-1 2 0
```

matching the input CNF 1-to-1. Hence, `frat-rs` verified that the proof steps were correct.

Closing so I can create a nicer one
