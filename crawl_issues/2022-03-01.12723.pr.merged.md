- Slightly rephrased the passage about language influences
- Deleted links to very outdated and unmaintained tanslations (I checked all of them and they were both multiple years outdated and not even completely translated, hence of little use for somebody who starts learning Solidity now)
- Added links to actively work-in-progress or complete translations
