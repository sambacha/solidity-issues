refs #12601

This is a draft and only the first step:

This implements a rough version of parsing file tags/markers and using them in the pre-existing test framework.
Main goal was functionality, not readability or performance.

Next steps are to make it more "file based" so that the expectations are also in the files..

Who'll port this to ``isoltest`` as well ;-P?

Well, I was given freedom on how exactly to do this. The plan is certainly to have an interface _like_ isoltest. 
Do you think it's worth the time & resources to port it to isoltest?

@christianparpart  maybe you can elaborate a bit why you chose python to do this :)

Sorry, my comment was probably a bit misleading - I'm not saying this stuff should be ported into isoltest (as a matter of fact I'm not sure if we hadn't been better off to write isoltest as a set of scripts) - I meant that this way of reporting locations is nice and it'd be worth a thought to change the isoltest syntax tests to report source locations just like this (IIRC we may even have an issue about that).
But yeah, for this PR, you can basically disregard my comment.

Should be ready to review & merge (only the first steps! more PRs will come)

Mind you, I am no python expert, so suggestions welcome

@Marenz I have two remarks that are not in code lines you changed, but makes the test results with markers harder to read:
- `print(e)` in `except ExpectationFailed as e:` is redundant due to data it provides is printed also in the very next line of the code (`print(traceback.format_exc())`)
- Because python dictionaries are unordered, in case of a test failure, we end up with a confusing massage like this: 
  `Expected {'start': {'line': 7, 'character': 7}, 'end': {'line': 7, 'character': 20}}`
  `but got {'end': {'character': 21, 'line': 7}, 'start': {'character': 8, 'line': 7}}.`
 
  The simplest fix I can imagine is to `json.dump(dict, sort_keys=True)` before `super().__init__` in `class ExpectationFailed(Exception)`.

Other than that I see only minor issues like code formatting that does not adhere to PEP8 rules:
- variable and function names should be lowercase
- two spaces are expected before inline comment
- two blank lines are expected between class definitions

I fixed some of the PEP8 things you mentioned, though probably not all. I want to focus more on my additions in this PR.
Also enhanced the exception reporting as per your suggestion

sorry for the late response. I didn't find this PR at first. will review that ASAP @Marenz (pls request review next time :) )

The first implementation was in C++ but I rewrote it in Python because we initially thought it's helpful to use an **existing** LSP client library. So after having switched to Python utilizing an existing LSP client library, we realized that I had to maintain a fork of that library to actually be useful. So We decided to drop that dependency and simply do the JSON-RPC I/O explicitly, which was a good choice.

I'd have favored C++ probably also for this refactor, now, since we know that the transport layer is so thin that it's not really complicated at all. And the the goal of this refactor is also to keep the tests in the .sol files only, so when the isoltest-like tool is being refactored/rewritten into something else/C++, then no tests would be needed to be touched. On the other hand, the motivation is that Python (nor C++) should be needed to be touched just to add a new LSP test.

Rebased.
