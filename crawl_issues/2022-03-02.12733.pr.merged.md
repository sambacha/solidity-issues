# [\#12733 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12733) `merged`: Workaround for a race condition in Perpetual Pools ext test due to parallel compilation on Hardhat 2.9.0
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-03-02 15:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12733):

Hardhat 2.9.0 released a few days ago introduced parallel compilation of Solidity files. `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` breaks due to this because during compilation it stores info in a file and then reads back from it. The file gets corrupted if multiple instances of its compilation hook try to do this.

The workaround is to use Hardhat 2.8.4 until https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades/issues/528 is fixed.
