In the following code, the mstore8 can be removed because if the addition wraps, the mstore will revert. If it does not wrap, it is covered.
```
mstore8(add(free_mem_ptr, 31), 200)
mstore(free_mem_ptr, 300)
```
The same is true about the extcodecopy in this example:
```
extcodecopy(value, add(memPtr, 32), 0, length)
sstore(0, mload(memPtr))
return(0, 0)
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
