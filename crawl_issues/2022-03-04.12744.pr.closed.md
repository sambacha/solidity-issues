Attempt to fix https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12738
Should also fix https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11118

Not ready yet:
- [ ] needs Changelog entry
- [ ] needs unit tests
- [ ] needs a decision on whether we want a better way to determine whether a yul object is creation code than checking for the ``_deployed`` suffix.
- [ ] needs to check if the change in legacy code gen in ``libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp`` is needed - and should either get a test for it or have the change reverted (if it affects legacy codegen, we also have to consider if it's an "important bug")

[rebased to ``develop`` again - will now look into moving the flag into ``Assembly``]

Closing this in favour of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12748 (will reopen if we end up preferring the solution here instead).
