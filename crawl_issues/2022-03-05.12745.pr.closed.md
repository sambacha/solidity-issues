Thank you for your pull request! Did you try to compile it? It seems that `SetOnce` now needs to be qualified.

How would SetOnce be qualified?

I would assume using `util::SetOnce`

Looks like we got a similar PR just merged: #12746.

This one was first but the other one addresses the problem fully, passes tests and is already merged so I'm going to close this one.
