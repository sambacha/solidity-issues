Can you also add the functions in ``EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`` in ``cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake``?
``EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`` has been deprecated for a while - I've been meaning to move them to ``EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS`` for a while, but never got around to.

EDIT: Actually wait... the warning is
```
em++: warning: EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS is deprecated, please use EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS instead [-Wdeprecated]
```

so those should actually end up in ``EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS`` not in ``EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS``....
So we can do it separately, i.e. nevermind for this PR.

Since we require cmake 3.13 anyways, you can also simply use https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/list.html#join on a list, can't you?

@ekpyron It's not just joining but alsp prefixing the symbols with `_`. This is done to make it easier on the caller side, to allow word-based auto-completion and avoid accidental mistypings of the symbol names.
