# [\#12750 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12750) `merged`: typeCheckAbiEncodeCallFunction should type check the arguments on functionPointerType->asExternallyCallableFunction instead of the plain function type

@ekpyron I'm seeing that ExpressionCompiler.cpp just calls `abiEncode` without a target type. Is this actually safe?

We should at least change it, but let me think if I can come up with an example that breaks.

``IRGeneratorForStatements.cpp`` also doesn't use the parameter types of the function type, but the encoding types of the argument tuple...

I just tested the `b_ubu_static` artifact from this PR with the cases I listed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12718#issuecomment-1064322093 and looks like the PR does fix them. I.e. it fixes the first one and the other two are actually expected to error out due to types that are not implicitly convertible.

Ah, wait. The case with function pointers is actually valid. This is the same exact function type and it's rejected simply because the function type has a `calldata` argument. For `memory` it does not happen. The PR does not fix that problem.

That's a separate issue, though, isn't it? That also doesn't work for directly calling a function...
<details>
<pre>
interface I {
      function f(function (string calldata) external) external;
  }
  
  contract C {
      function g(string calldata) external {}
  
      function main() external view {
          I x;
          x.f(this.g);
          abi.encodeCall(I.f, (this.g));
      }
  }
</pre>
fails with both
<pre>
Error: Invalid type for argument in function call. Invalid implicit conversion from function (string memory) external to function (string calldata) external requested.
  --> test.sol:10:6:
   |
10 |    x.f(this.g);
   |        ^^^^^^

Error: Cannot implicitly convert component at position 0 from "function" to "function".
  --> test.sol:11:29:
   |
11 |         abi.encodeCall(I.f, (this.g));
   |                             ^^^^^^^^
</pre>
after this PR

</details>

So that should be fixed in ``asExternallyCallableFunction`` (or whatever it's coming from) instead.

True. Looks like it's not a problem with `abi.encodeCall()` but a more general one. I'll report a separate issue so that we can focus only on `encodeCall()` here.

Reported in #12778.

there is a coding style problem

Also, still needs more test cases in my opinion.
