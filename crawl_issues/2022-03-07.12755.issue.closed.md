**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

```
{
    let _1 := memoryguard(0x80)
    mstore(64, _1)
    let _2 := 0
    switch shr(224, calldataload(_2))
    case 0x06661abd {
        mstore(_1, sload(_2))
        return(_1, 32)
    }
    case 0xc2985578 {
        return(mload(64), _2)
    }
}

// step: fullSuite

// {
//     {
//         let _1 := memoryguard(0x80)
//         mstore(64, _1)
//         switch shr(224, calldataload(0))
//         case 0x06661abd {
//             mstore(_1, sload(0))
//             return(_1, 32)
//         }
//         case 0xc2985578 { return(mload(64), 0) }
//     }
// }
```

The mload at the end should be replaced by `_1`, but somehow it is not. The `mstore` in the first swich case seems to destroy it.

Similar example:
```
let x := 1
if calldataload(0) {
  x := 8
  revert(0, 0)
}
mstore(0, x)
```
The DataFlowAnalyzer will not be aware of the value of x in the last statement. It should take into account if a branching control-flow terminates or not before it clears knowledge of local variables and storage / memory.

There is a comment with ``// This is a little too destructive, we could retain the old values.`` in the switch case of the ``DataFlowAnalyzer``... that's probably it... ``clearKnowledgeIfInvalidated(_case.body)`` will clear all knowledge about memory, if the first case has any memory side effects...

This is really interesting, I was not aware that it is so limited. For direct mstore / sstore operations, it takes into account if the location is overlapping or not - have to think this through again...

For reference: The [improvedDataFlow](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/improvedDataFlow) branch stemming from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12769 contained some preliminary work towards this.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
