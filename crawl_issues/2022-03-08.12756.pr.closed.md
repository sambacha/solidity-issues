Two more things:
- Please add `Fixes #10308` to your description so that github will automatically close the issue when we merge this.
- I'd recommend not submitting PRs from the `develop` branch of your fork. Keeping it up to date with `develop` in the upstream repo is always a bit awkward. In my experience it's much more convenient to use a feature branch.

@cameel Thanks for the review, I have made another commit addressing your initial issues so hopefully this fixes any issues!

I added the recommended changes and I've added in some unit tests to cover this functionality too.

By the way, please don't get discouraged by the comments, I think this is overall going in the right direction :) Especially I like that we now will have this covered with some tests!

@cameel Are you happy for me to merge this one now? It's been open for a while just wanted to see if you wanted any more changes.

@bmoo0 Hello, sorry for not going back to this one sooner but there's just been too much happening. We still have a huge heap of PRs to get through and on top of that right now most of the team (including me) is still at Devconnect.

So for now, just a few short comments. I discussed this with @chriseth earlier and the problem is really that this refactor complicates the mechanism more than we expected it would. There were two major conclusions from that discussion:
- Currently there are very few restrictions on how the `.bin` object would look like. Now with this PR we have to detect the bytecode so I had to push for move validations and this unfortunately makes things complicated. We also have to support old format for placeholders.

    One idea to make things simpler is basically to make it a breaking change scheduled for 0.9.0. This way we could drop all the legacy stuff and inconvenient restrictions. To do that you would have to change the base branch of the PR to a branch called `breaking`.
- A very valuable part of the PR as it is currently are the tests. If you extracted them into a separate PR we'd gladly accept them - or at least the part that would still work on top of `develop` branch.

What do you think? If you agree with these changes I could try to go over the PR again and give some hints on what specifically should be carried over and what would not be necessary when we make the change breaking.

Sounds good to me. I can actually break it out into two PRs if that's better. One containing the tests branched from the develop branch and the other adding the breaking change which can stem from the breaking branch, if that makes things simpler.

Great! Tests should go into `develop` since they do not have to wait for a breaking release.

It seems the PR needs a rebase to resolve the current conflicts.
I see the plan was to split out the tests and make this one breaking.. any updates on that? Can we help or should we take over parts possible?

Since this PR seems stale is going to be split up anyway, I'm closing for now. The code is still available in the branch.

Hey sorry I was away for awhile count' work on this. I think the tests can still be merged if you think they're useful I just accidentally pulled too many changes into my branch and need to look up how to only merge my new tests.
