Did I miss anything?
Somebody should probably really do https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12668 before we merge this...

Do we have a test that shows that the old flag still works?

No, but I can add one back. [EDIT: done - changed the command line test script to compare against both flags; EDIT2: removed that again now and added a small test for the command line parser instead]

- `layout-in-storage.rst`, `optimizer.rst` and `ir-breaking-changes.rst` refer to the IR mode as experimental and sometimes mention the `--experimental-via-ir` flag. [@ekpyron: done I think]
- Some comments still call it experimental in `CompilerStack.h` [@ekpyron: done I think]
- We still have this warning in `StandardCompiler.cpp` and `CommandLineInterface.cpp`:
    ```
    Yul is still experimental. Please use the output with care.
    ```
    - There are also a few different places in tests that cut out this message from test output. We should remove that too.

That's compilation of pure Yul, not solidity code generation via-IR, though, so its not exactly the same thing. Marking solidity compilation via IR as non-experimental covers only a subset of all possible Yul programs... that being said it'd be a bit weird to keep referring to yul as experimental... I'll remove this in a separate commit.

Actually, did we still consider Yul experimental until now or is it just leftover?

Is Yul really stable :-)? Especially the object format and stuff like the "optimizer hint builtins" I can still see changing... that doesn't affect the stability of compiling *via Yul*, but it does affect stuff written in the language Yul itself...

Interesting. I always considered Yul itself less experimental than the codegen :) We even had normal changelog for it and not for the codegen.

I would say it's just a leftover. We have been using yul in production in the abi encoder for years now.
