Extracted from #12736:

> The PR also disables one particularly flaky test file in ElementFi. It has one case that fails often and has been reported upstream (https://github.com/element-fi/elf-contracts/issues/240) but also many tests in the file seem to depend on an external service, which has resulted in a mass failure due to network timeout at least once when the service was down.
