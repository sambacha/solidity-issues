# [\#12768 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12768) `merged`: Euler timeout fix: switch to TEST_TIMEOUT variable
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Followup to #12765. The failure in [22877](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/22877/workflows/224204c3-78fc-457c-ae2a-b0a980550af6/jobs/1004400) shows that the fix suggested in https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/issues/97 does not work. The `mocha.timeout` setting is ignored. After some experimenting I determined that it's because Euler [overrides that timeout in `eTestLib.js`](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/blob/master/test/lib/eTestLib.js#L1007-L1017) so the setting is ignored.

Fortunately you can set a custom timeout via `TEST_TIMEOUT` env variable and this is what I'm doing in this PR.

I verified that setting `TEST_TIMEOUT` to a very low value makes all tests time out so I think this time it's going to work as expected.

I'm leaving in the helper I added in #12765. It's not used by any test now but it might still come in handy in the future.
