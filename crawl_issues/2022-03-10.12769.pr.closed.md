Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12755

This probably needs some more tests.

I spent some time looking at the ``call_options_overload`` test that properly fails in CI...
I think it's a homestead run (I can only reproduce it for that locally)...

But still I neither saw what's wrong in Yul nor in the generated asm even...

Until I finally noticed: it's an actual ``out-of-gas``... changing it to ``3000`` gas makes it pass... :-).

Hahaha - I think now I see what really happened :-).

The homestead test failure is due to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12668 !

Unoptimized it's a stack-too-deep case. I haven't verified, but I think before this PR, it needed the full optimizer to recover from that, hence gas cost for the function call was low in practice.
After this PR, I think the minimal optimizations are enough to fix the stack-too-deep error - but the function is not sufficiently optimized for the call to go through with 1000 gas. So only ``--evm-version homestead --optimize`` passes, but ``--evm-version homestead`` fails.

So yeah, we can just bump the gas value there :-).

Minor update from the fuzzer: There are no divergences between unoptimized and optimized programs found due to this PR after several days of fuzzing.

Needs some update I guess, based on comments.

Hm... should have proceeded with this sooner... now the conflicts list looks like this will make for an uncomfortable rebase...

Damn yea true. We could try and see how much effort that'd be. Most conflicts are in tests which can just be ignored and rerun.

Nope, I meant the actual conflicts in basically everything that was changed here - just had a peek, it's definitely non-trivial to rebase, although probably feasible.

After a quick chat with @chriseth we decided to close this for now, since the data flow analyzer is up for a refactor anyways and it may be easier to recreate this afterwards.
