## Abstract

The value returned by address.balance is slightly different for msg.sender. In that case it is reduced by the transaction's gas limit multiplied by the tx.gasprice.

Code that attempts to compare balances and make decisions should be aware of this.

I have proposed a tweak to the documentation for address.balance. Please review and edit as appropriate.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
