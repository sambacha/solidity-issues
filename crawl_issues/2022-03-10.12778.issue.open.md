## Description
The compiler seems to treat pointers to functions taking `calldata` arguments as if they had `memory` arguments instead. You cannot assign them, pass into a function of use in `abi.encodeCall()` even when the target type exactly matches the type of the function pointer.

## Steps to Reproduce
### `calldata` is not accepted
```solidity
contract C {
    function f(function (string calldata) external) external {}
    function g(string calldata) external {}

    function main() external {
        function (string calldata) external ptr = this.g;
        abi.encodeCall(this.f, (this.g));
        this.f(this.g);
    }
}
```
```
Error: Type function (string memory) external is not implicitly convertible to expected type function (string calldata) external.
 --> test.sol:6:9:
  |
6 |         function (string calldata) external ptr = this.g;
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Error: Cannot implicitly convert component at position 0 from "function" to "function".
 --> test.sol:7:32:
  |
7 |         abi.encodeCall(this.f, (this.g));
  |                                ^^^^^^^^

Error: Invalid type for argument in function call. Invalid implicit conversion from function (string memory) external to function (string calldata) external requested.
 --> test.sol:8:16:
  |
8 |         this.f(this.g);
  |                ^^^^^^
```

### `memory` is accepted instead
On the other hand this compiles without errors:
```solidity
contract C {
    function g(bytes calldata b) external returns (bytes calldata) {
        return b[2:5];
    }

    function main() external returns (bytes memory) {
        function (bytes memory) external returns (bytes memory) ptr = this.g;
        bytes memory b = "123456789";
        return ptr(b);
    }
}
```

I checked in Remix and it even properly slices the `memory` string argument even though we only support slicing `calldata`.

This should probably be disallowed given that you can't normally pass in `memory` arguments to functions taking `calldata`. Also, when the functions are `internal`, the compiler does produce an error:
```
Error: Type function (bytes calldata) returns (bytes calldata) is not implicitly convertible to expected type function (bytes memory) returns (bytes memory).
 --> test.sol:7:9:
  |
7 |         function (bytes memory) internal returns (bytes memory) ptr = g;
  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

## Environment
- Compiler version: 0.8.12

@cameel thanks for creating this issue, faced it today. Any expectations when this could be fixed?

But I managed to make it work with `public/internal` method instead of `external` and by using `g` instead of `this.g`:
```solidity
function (string calldata) external ptr = this.g;
```
=>
```solidity
function (string calldata) internal ptr = g;
```

This should be pretty simple to fix and we'd like people to use function pointers more so I think we could bump the priority here.

@nishant-sachdeva You were looking for a new task recently, maybe you'd like to work on this?

@cameel  Sure! I'd like to take this up

This is almost surely again related to the function type being changed by calling `FunctionType::asExternallyCallableFunction` when it shouldn't be called.

I'm actually not sure this is a bug after all. `function (string calldata) external` is a type that is not really useful and maybe we should disallow it. I think it is not useful because for external function pointers, you are only interested in the calling side and not in the called side. For the caller, it does not make sense to even distinguish `function (string calldata) external` and `function (string memory) external`. The type of `this.g` takes a `memory` argument, even if the function signature uses `calldata`.

Ok, I see why it might make sense to make such a pointer compatible with `memory` rather than `calldata`. But then I think this behavior is surprising to users (it was to me) and at the very least, we should document this and the error message should have a hint suggesting to use the `memory` version instead.

Or maybe we could adjust syntax to make it less puzzling? I see two possibilities:
- Make the `calldata` and `memory` variant interchangeable. Allow assignment both ways.
- Drop the location from external function pointer syntax altogether since it's meaningless.

What do you think?

@nishant-sachdeva So this needs more discussion but I think there are a few uncontroversial things we could do right away:
- Document this case.
- Improve the error message.
- Add semantic and syntax tests covering all possible location combinations here.

Since we had a discussion on this, in which @cameel and @hrkrshnn argued against just disallowing ``calldata`` types: looking at and thinking through this again, I still agree with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12778#issuecomment-1169917941.

Whether the external function ``f`` has been declared with ``memory`` or ``calldata`` arguments has zero influence on the semantics of ``this.f``, so it should not be reflected in its type. Even more so, assuming we *were* to keep allowing both ``memory`` and ``calldata`` arguments in external function types, they would need to be implicitly convertible in both directions, which is conceptually bad (implicit conversions have to define a proper partial order) and counterintuitive. The only way around that would be to not consider them separate types, but merely alias syntax for the *same* type, which is even weirder.

So I'm still strongly in favour of disallowing ``calldata`` arguments in external function pointers.

@ekpyron , @cameel 
> it's likely that we will want to disallow such pointers after all. Or do something else that will make this warning irrelevant.

Won't be adding a warning to the PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13227 . Will keep that for a future PR once a final call is taken on this.

But we kinda have the same situation with functions in interfaces. Should we disallow `calldata` there too?

Decision from the last call:
- We'll make specifying location in external function pointers optional.
- In a breaking release we will disallow function pointers with calldata arguments.
- We'll discuss doing the same for interfaces separately.
