This is a rough draft that is already usable. Not all goto tests where converted yet.

I plan to make the code a lot nicer and convert all goto tests and others that are feasable.

I was wondering how this script is actually called. So I was using grep and found this one 
`"$REPO_ROOT/scripts/test_solidity_lsp.py" "${SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR}/solc/solc"` in `scripts/tests.sh`. But this script seem not exist.

`./test/lsp.py ./build/solc/solc` - given that your local solc is at `./build/solc/solc` as it is the binary to be spawned for each test case and assuming you are in project root.

That still leaves the question what 
`"$REPO_ROOT/scripts/test_solidity_lsp.py" "${SOLIDITY_BUILD_DIR}/solc/solc"` in `scripts/tests.sh.` actually is and does :D

the script got renamed to `lsp.py` but where this script got referenced, apparently not. :)
