**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

~~**Depends on #12868.**~~

This is the initial version of my script for comparing benchmarks.

I still have a few small features to add (displaying absolute values in the table, filtering presets, etc.) but I'll be doing these in separate PRs. Adding it to CI so that diffs are generated automatically as artifacts will also be a separate PR.

This is now ready to review.

To test the script:
1) Get the `summarized-benchmarks.json` artifact from the PR you want to benchmark and from its base branch (usually `develop`). For example:
    - [artifacts of job 1015877 on `develop`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23130/workflows/5277bdf0-b66d-462c-83f4-2a54fafa9c9f/jobs/1015877/artifacts)
    - [artifacts of job 1016397 on `benchmark-differ`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23142/workflows/3437be7d-02fc-4325-a9dc-62cddbd66d76/jobs/1016397/artifacts)
2) See `scripts/externalTests/benchmark_diff.py --help` for usage instructions.
3) Try plain JSON diff in place:
    ```bash
    scripts/externalTests/benchmark_diff.py inplace \
        summarized-benchmarks-develop.json \
        summarized-benchmarks-branch.json
    ```
    The output is the same exact JSON structure as input but with differences in place of the original values.
    By default the output contains absolute values but you can also request relative differences (`--style relative`). With `--style humanized` you can get them rendered in a nicer way, in particular the fractions are replaced with percentages. By default values are rounded to 4 decimal places (2 if they're percentages) but you can change that with `--precision` option.

    The nice thing about this mode is that it makes very few assumptions about the JSON structure. Basically - just that the `version` field represents version. You can use it to diff arbitrary JSON output with numeric values, even deeply nested. For example this will work just fine on the `all-benchmarks.json` artifact, which contains detailed gas breakdown for each contract function and each deployed contract.

4) Try a diff table:
    ```bash
    scripts/externalTests/benchmark_diff.py table \
        summarized-benchmarks-develop.json \
        summarized-benchmarks-branch.json
    ```
    By default it uses the `console` format, i.e. makes the table readable on the console. You can also use `--output-format json` to get raw JSON of that table. Or `--output-format markdown` to get markdown output that you can paste directly into a github comment. Note that with `markdown` output the `humanized` values are also slightly enhanced in a way that would not look good on the console, e.g. there's an emoji that should render green/red in a browser to make positive and negative changes easier to spot. This style also makes non-zero values boid.

    This mode is designed to work specifically with the `summarized-benchmarks.json` artifact. It assumes that the input files have 3 nesting levels, corresponding to: project, preset, attribute.

## Sample output

Here's the rendered markdown table for the benchmark results I linked above:

`!V` = version mismatch
`!B` = no value in the "before" version
`!A` = no value in the "after" version
`!T` = one or both values were not numeric and could not be compared
`-0` = very small negative value rounded to zero
`+0` = very small positive value rounded to zero

I used the script to generate a report to compare [develop](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23130/workflows/5277bdf0-b66d-462c-83f4-2a54fafa9c9f/jobs/1015877/artifacts) and [feature branch](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23166/workflows/b7a1572d-7dc6-4fbe-9232-e23b367035c3/jobs/1017389/artifacts). My impression after the first use is that the "!A" and "!B" markers are a bit abused. I noticed that JSON keys for some group of tests are created with an absolute path to files in the /tmp directory. For instance: "/tmp/ext-test-ColonyNetworks-meX84J/ext/contracts/colony/ColonyExpenditure.sol:ColonyExpenditure:" . It seems "ext-test-ColonyNetworks-meX84J" keeps changing in consecutive builds. Maybe you could ignore this discrepancy in generated diff?

Colony is a bit of an odd one here. I had problems trying to update it to the latest upstream code last time I tried so we're using an old revision from our fork and that pulls in an old Truffle version. It's also the only one using Truffle since the other projects all switched to Hardhat - so it might be hitting some less tested code paths.

I could add some filtering for these paths but I'm not sure it's worth the effort (and special-casing the script for a specific test). The absolute paths you see are no longer a problem with newer Truffle and this will go away when I finally manage to update the test to use latest code.

So I'd ignore this particular test for now. At least as long as it's the only one exhibiting such problems.

Colony is just an example, but the problem seems to be wider. For summarized report I get "!V" also for elementfi, euler and prb-math. 
Another thing that could be helpful for a manual use is a possibility to filter out entries with an absolute result equal 0. Can we have such option? If this is too much for this issue we can create a follow-up.

Yeah, I've been thinking about adding this. I'm planning to do it in a separate PR though. I created an issue to track this feature: #12869.

> Colony is just an example, but the problem seems to be wider. For summarized report I get "!V" also for elementfi, euler and prb-math.

`!V` means that there were new commits in the upstream repo so benchmarks are very likely no longer comparable. That's expected if there was some time between the two benchmarks ran. I'm not sure how much of a problem it will be in practice. If it keeps happening too often, the right solution will be to switch to hard-coded commits in external tests instead of tracking the main branch. But for this we'll need a bit more infrastructure (i.e. at least a script for automatically updating these commit hashes over our 13+ ext tests) so I'm putting it off until we know that we really do need/want it.

I could also add an option for ignoring version. Also added to #12869.

Let me know about any other specific problems you see. The ones with Colony and `!V` are known limitations but there could also be some things I just missed.
