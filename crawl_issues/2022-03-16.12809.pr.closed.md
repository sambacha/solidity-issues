Replaces part of #12704.
Moved to #12834.

- replaces `scripts/ASTImportTest.sh` with `scripts/ImportExportTest.sh`
- `scripts/ImportExportTest.sh` is already prepared to test asm-json import/export, but right now these tests are just not triggered.

Oh!! Sorry for that! I think there is no need to move the comments.. I will try to integrate your feedback from here on the other PR.. I hope it will not create too much confusion

Well, you did say on the meeting that you'll be moving this to a bigger PR where tests actually test something so it's my fault. But no worries. Just copying them fortunately was not that bad. They're all in #12834 now (except 1 or 2 that were basically just responses to other comments).
