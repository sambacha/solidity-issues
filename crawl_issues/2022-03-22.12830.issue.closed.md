```solidity
// Bad interface
interface IERC20 {
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint value) external;
}
library SafeTransfer {
    function safeTransferFrom(IERC20 token, address from, address to, uint value) internal {
        // do nothing
    }
}
// This type checks, but would produce an error when used
// Error: Member "safeTransferFrom" not unique after argument-dependent lookup in contract IERC20.
using SafeTransfer for IERC20;

contract C {
    // using SafeTransfer for IERC20;
    IERC20 constant token = IERC20(address(0));
    function stake(uint value) external {
        // uncomment to see the error
        // token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);
    }
}
```

We retained the same mechanism that was in place already for "using" inside a contract.

The main issue now is that you can ship a file with a global using statement  and only realize at callsite that the statement cannot be used. I think we need to introduce more checks at the using statement definition.

Unfortunately, this would be a breaking change ðŸ˜¢

The decision was to break `using X for I` where `I` is interface or contract type. Will write a blog post regarding this.

`using SafeTransfer for IERC20 global` turned out to be an unintended feature, i.e. a bug.

Whether or not we should disallow `using X for I` for interfaces and contracts should probably be discussed with more user feedback, but I personally tend to disallowing it.

Essentially: If there is a different way to define member functions for types, the other way should be used.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
