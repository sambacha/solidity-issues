Patch for Gnosis Safe: https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/pull/394 (also only one contract affected)

And Bleeps is only affected through the `Governor` contract from OpenZeppelin.

I just pushed a commit with a workaround for this issue in Gnosis, Zeppelin and Bleeps. It's a simple replacement of the affected lines. We can just drop it from the PR if they fix the problem quickly or merge it if they don't.

Tests are failing. Is it just rebase or are there problems in the PR?

`chk_errorcodes` probably just needs a small tweak. I haven't reviewed the PR yet though so I don't know how complete it is.

As for external tests, they are failing because this change is technically not backwards-compatible (we're treating it as a bugfix). @chriseth took care of submitting fixes to OZ and ENS (https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/pull/65), I did Gnosis. Bleeps breakage turned out to be coming from the OZ dependency.

The only reason why Gnosis, OZ and Bleeps passed here was that I added a quick and dirty workaround in case this does not get fixed upstream quickly. I did not do ENS because I did not investigate that one.

Anyway, looks like OZ and ENS merged our PRs. The only remaining one is Gnosis (zero reaction so far). So I guess I'll remove the workarounds for everything except Gnosis and ext tests should pass. Other than that, this still needs the fix for `chk_errorcode` and a review.

I just reverted workarounds for OZ and Bleeps. Looks like my PR will be merged in Gnosis soon and then we'll be able to remove that one too.

Looks like for ENS we'll actually have to switch to the `master` branch. We're currently at a tag but they don't have too many tags and the fix is only in `master`.

And for Bleeps we'll have to wait for an OZ release (or hard-code it to use a pre-release). [A new OZ release is currently in an open review period, which will end around April 22nd](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/release-candidate-for-contracts-4-6-open-review-period/27075).

Current status regarding external tests:
- **ENS**: there's a fix upstream but we're using an earlier, tagged version. Because of this there was an extra commit here to switch ENS from that tag to `master` branch. It won't pass otherwise. This commit has to be restored (I still have it locally).
- **Bleeps**: Turns out it's actually [hard-coded for OZ 4.3.2](https://github.com/wighawag/bleeps/blob/bb90cd033f91c56e3148f0609ebc128a55c9381f/contracts/package.json#L30) so it does not pick up the latest 4.6.0 despite the fact that we're removing `package.lock`. So we need to force the newer one in `bleeps.sh`:
    ```bash
    npm install @openzeppelin/contracts@>=4.6.0
    ```
    - The problem is that on 4.6.0 there's an unrelated error:
        ```
        DeclarationError: Identifier not found or not unique.
          --> src/bleepsdao/BleepsDAOGovernor.sol:31:9:
           |
        31 |         ERC20Votes _token,
           |         ^^^^^^^^^^
        ```
        Maybe `ERC20Votes` was moved to a different location in one of the newer versions of OZ. Or it used to be imported by some transitive dependency and now no longer is. Unfortunately I think we'll have to patch that ourselves.
- **Brink**: this is a new test and we have not reported the problem there. Probably best to patch it on our side now.
- **Gnosis**: [My upstream PR](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/pull/394) has not been merged yet so patching on our side this is still needed.

The ext tests should all be passing now. I restored the ENS and Gnosis workarounds and added a new one for Brink (also submitted a PR upstream: https://github.com/brinktrade/brink-core/pull/52).

For Bleeps it turns out that updating to OZ 4.6.0 and patching the single compilation error that appears after that makes a ton of other compilation errors pop up. So I gave up, kept it at OZ 4.3.2 and just copied the patch command we had here for OZ formerly.

ENS is now failing. My commit updates it to the latest version and in that version apparently they have some low-level functions for doing reverts ([`LowLevelCallUtils.propagateRevert()`](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/43b483db7ae3b13b985b3600779aa4e65ca22964/contracts/utils/LowLevelCallUtils.sol#L45-L53)) or just accessing the returndata ([`LowLevelCallUtils.readReturnData()`](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/43b483db7ae3b13b985b3600779aa4e65ca22964/contracts/utils/LowLevelCallUtils.sol#L33-L43)).

[`UniversalResolver.callWithOffchainLookupPropagation()`](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/43b483db7ae3b13b985b3600779aa4e65ca22964/contracts/utils/UniversalResolver.sol#L67-L73) uses them like this:
```solidity
        bool result = LowLevelCallUtils.functionStaticCall(target, data);
        uint256 size = LowLevelCallUtils.returnDataSize();

        if(result) {
            return LowLevelCallUtils.readReturnData(0, size);
        }
```

So apparently #12860 does break some things (though in their case fix is trivial, just make these functions `view`).

Just to be clear, this is not caused directly by this PR, merging #12860 broke it. It only shows up here due to the ENS update (which we do to get an upstream fix for the override issue and avoid having to do even more patching in external tests).

Since we plan to revert https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12860 that should fix the ens test breakage.

You can rebase this on #13027 if you want to be sure all external tests pass.

Rebased, so please don't merge before #13027
