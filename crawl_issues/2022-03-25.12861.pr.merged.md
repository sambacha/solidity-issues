# [\#12861 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12861) `merged`: Disallow RETURNDATACOPY and RETURNDATASIZE in inline assembly in pure functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-03-25 19:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12861):

Fixes #12860.

The PR also adds comprehensive test cases for opcodes allowed/disallowed at each visibility level.

Notes from the call: allow this. Might need to think about memory operations in the future.

Also, `returndatasize` may be used by gas optimizers instead of `push1 0`. In that sense, this can break some contracts.

Allow what? Allow RETURNDATACOPY in pure functions or allow this PR to be merged?

I think @hrkrshnn meant allow the disallow ;)

I meant to say that allow this change ;)

Just do add one more comment. These opcodes `returndatasize` and `returndatacopy` are indeed used in high level calls. For example:

```solidity
contract C {
    function f() pure external returns (uint) {}
}

contract Test {
    function test() pure external returns (uint ret) {
        ret = C(address(123)).f();
    }
}
```

@cameel Maybe we should rename this PR (and commit messages) to communicate that this is only disallowing this in inline assembly? 
@hrkrshnn I guess we don't want to allow this for high-level calls, right? Shouldn't be all calls disallowed in pure?

@aarlt About high level calls: I'd argue, yes. In particular, we should make pure to be as close to compile time evaluation as possible. Changing the behaviour for high level calls would definitely be a breaking change. Technically, this one as well, but we're trying to argue that we haven't mentioned the assembly part in the documentation.

Good point. Done.

Personally I think it would be better to treat it as breaking because it's more of an omission than a real bug. But on the other hand we were called out on this which means that people already expect it to work that way...

I'd consider it a proper bug - if these are called before any external call in the pure function itself, then it's definitely contrary to the intended meaning of ``pure`` (under *every* of the different views on what ``pure`` means ;-)) - you can construct pure functions that read state like that after all... (respectively pure functions with different behaviour based on some state that affected the previous external call).
We could of course take drastic measures and do control flow analysis and only flag this in paths, in which there is no pure external call up front - but that's significant effort and in 0.9 we may disallow external calls in pure functions anyways (undecided though)... and it also wouldn't be perfect and would also have false positives... so whatever we do, it's not perfectly nice and maybe disallowing as non-breaking bug-fix is indeed the least harmful way to deal with it.

Is returndata really a part of state though? I see it more like some random piece of memory, which is why it seems like a grey area and is just easier to lump together with state than treat as a thing of its own.

Yeah, I was a bit torn on this when writing that comment myself :-)... I mean - in a lot of cases the returndata of the previous call will literally be lying around somewhere in memory and thereby be accessible via ``mload``... so is ``mload`` also impure :-)?

We need to maintain a map of polluted memory slots :P

Anyway, I think the change is good, just not 100% convinced that the case is clear enough that it should be a bugfix.

Another argument for considering this breaking after all is
https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/LowLevelCallUtils.sol

I guess those helper functions were specifically marked ``pure`` because before this change the compiler actively *suggested* to *make* them pure... after which making this an error in a non-breaking release is probably a bit mean...

Yeah, let's make it breaking.
