# [\#12868 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12868) `merged`: Workarounds for ext test breakage (ethers.js downgrade, disabled polygon test in zeppelin, switch to compiler-only in elementfi)
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This is a bunch of workarounds for recent breakage in external tests. The PR was originally addressing just the ethers.js one but breakage keeps piling up. I decided to just add new fixes here so that it can be merged without special provileges. Otherwise the ethers.js fix on its own would not pass tests and would require a force merge. 
1) Workaround for breakage caused by https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2849.
2) Removal of the workaround added in #12733 since that seems to have been fixed upstream.
3) OpenZeppelin has a new test related to polygon that hits https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2115 and had to be disabled
4) ElementFi now completely stopped working without alchemy.io key. All I could do was to switch all presets to compile-only mode. We won't be able to run the test suite but at least we can still run compilation via IR and we'll get bytecode size in benchmarks.
    - I originally thought that only some of their tests ran with alchemy. Apparently that's pretty much all of them. They had alchemy.io key hard-coded in the config file and the current breakage is caused by it finally being removed. This explains why this ext test was so flaky.

Closing since it got accidentally merged along with #12874.

Looks like I was wrong about it being merged. I.e. it got merged but not into develop. Reopening.

I just pushed commits adding fixes for the new breakage in zeppelin and elementfi. See updated PR description for details.
