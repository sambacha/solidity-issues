The prior text left questions open about what this might look like, and how it might be used.

Sounds good. Please be explicit if any of what you said -- e.g. rebasing -- is my responsibility. I guess I would pull the patch out of my repo, do a git rebase, and push??

Yeah. We're using a rebase workflow which means that normally you'd create a branch on top of `develop` and keep it on top of it. I.e. when some PR gets merged into `develop`, you'd pull changes into your local working copy of the repo and do `git rebase` so that your branch is again on top.

You might get conflicts when rebasing, which means that the changes in `develop` touched the same parts you touched in your branch. In that case you need to resolve them. To do you select version from one of the branches or rewrite it to incorporate changes from both sides. Afterwards your branch looks as if you did your edits on top of the new version from `develop`. How you resolve them depends on the git tool your using.

We also usually want the commits in the branch to make it easy to understand what happened. I.e. if you changed something, then changed it back, then changed it again in a different way, we want just one commit going straight from the initial version to the final one. This is really more important with more complex code changes. For documentation changes this basically means that in most cases you should have just a single commit in your branch. If you have more, you can "squash" them into a single commit while rebasing. This also makes rebasing easier since the more commits, the more conflicts can there be. E.g. if you add something in one commit and remove it in another, you won't see it in the final diff - as if it was not touched at all - but individual commits can still conflict with other changes at that spot made in another PR merged in the meantime into `develop`.

Also, regarding this:

> Removed trailing whitespace (`chk_coding_style` CI job was failing because of that)

Random whitespace changes are just unnecessary noise in PR diffs and make reviewing harder. The typical way to avoid them is to have the editor automatically remove any trailing whitespace. Pretty much all programming editors have a setting for that.

One of the checks in the CI job that enforces coding style conventions is a check for trailing whitespace to make sure people have their editor configured like that. This check failed for you so I guess github's editor is not removing such whitespace?

> Added more index keywords.

As for index, I find it pretty handy when searching for stuff: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/genindex.html
Unfortunately not everyone remembers about updating these keywords. This time I noticed that after your changes some could be added so I went ahead and did it. This is not required but just nice to have. If you notice missing keywords in the section you're editing, please add them.

You can refer to [Index-generating markup](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#index-generating-markup) if you want to know the syntax but the gist that will get you through 99% of cases is that you put an index directive before a section and list topics, separated with commas:
```
.. index:: inheritance list, ! base;constructor, contract;abstract, abstract contract, ! snakes
```

keywords can contain spaces. `!` means that it's the "main" entry for this topic (otherwise it's just something on a different subject that happens to mention it). With a semicolon you create subentries for a broader topic - they'll show up as a small indented list under that keyword in the index.

Thx. I read up on rst syntax.

Looks like you closed the PR by accident.

It's because you renamed your branch `patch-16` to `clarify-try-catch-success-block`. Can you rename it back so that we can reopen it and merge? Unfortunately github does not let you rename branches that are already used in PRs. It just closes the PR if the original branch disappears.

Will do that now.

Hmm... looks like I still can't reopen this. If the "Reopen and comment" button is enabled for you, please use it. If not, maybe just create a new PR with the same branch.

New PR inbound.
