Adds the other case where a contract must be abstract. I've noted the Solidity docs do not use certain words in a "strict" way. For example, the word "define" vs "declare" vs "implemented."  I would propose in future versions of the documentation, the word "define" should never be used if the word "declare" can be used instead. I think for most people coming from other compiled languages, the word "definition" is closer to the word "implementation" ... i.e., a definition of a thing includes all of what's necessary to instantiate the thing.

By the way, don't worry about the failing `test_ext` jobs. #12868 fixes that. They'll pass when that PR is merged into `develop` and you rebase on top of it.

True. I noticed the same and I think we should try to be stricter about it.

chriseth had asked me to break up my PRs into smaller chunks. FYI, I haven't pulled down the whole repo yet (thinking I was just going to make a few spot adjustments) and have been using the github editing tools to create the patches and PRs directly on github. I'll figure out how to rename the patches here or, start editing in a local repo.

Sure, breaking it down is good. It means we will be able to discuss and merge them piecemeal instead of being stuck for a long time in a huge thread with a mix of everything.

I think it would be best to be editing locally, especially since these PRs often need a rebase (e.g. you'll need to rebase on `develop` to get rid of the CI failures because the fix has been merged there) but if you prefer doing it on github, that's fine too. We can help you squash/rebase/rename the commit before merging the PR. It would be nice to at least rename the PR though since you can do this via github's UI, just click "edit" near the title at the top of the page here.

Oh ok, I thought you meant you wanted me to change the name of the branch itself (patch-18 e.g.) as github creates it when I click "Suggest Changes" after doing an edit. I posted a new issue to the github community discussion about that--I feel that button should give you the ability to instantly change the patch name. Unless I missed it it's otherwise many clicks to get to the spot where you can do so!

I can't seem to figure out a way to make a change to my PR that is in addition to or different from clicking "Commit Suggestion" on one of your suggestions. Thanks in advance for the usage tips :)

I mean, I did, but I didn't know you were creating the PRs via github UI. In that case there's probably not much you can do. I'd say, just keep PR titles distinct and it's good enough for us.

Just FYI, you can actually change the patch name. You just have to navigate to it awkwardly (back through your repos, click branches -- which only shows up if your window is wide enough -- in the repo view, then rename the branch/patch there, and create the pull request from there).

Rebased on `develop`, which now has a fix for the failing CI jobs.
