I'm not 100% sure my proposed clarification is in fact correct. Maybe the non-memory-safe nature of the first code snippet is due to some other reason. However, the immediately preceeding documentation says that accessing memory at location 0 *is* memory safe, and the example non-memory-safe snippet accesses memory at location 0!

Therefore, why is it unsafe? This is the reason I came up with. If it's wrong, lets state what the actual reason is.

I now commited my suggested simplification. Would you say this is still enough of a clarification?

I made a small addition. Looks good.
