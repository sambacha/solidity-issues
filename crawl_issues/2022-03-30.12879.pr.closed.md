# [\#12879 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12879) `closed`: Clarify leading relative path segments in import paths
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`

Note: The "Preview" tab on github did *NOT* show the .. code:: block around line ~290 even before my changes. Not sure what's up with that. The rst seems correct, and it displays properly  at ``https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/path-resolution.html#import-callback``

Also, I inferred the rule for ``.`` in the leading part of the import path based on the description that the import path itself is first normalized. My edit may therefore be incorrect if ``..`` segments in the leading part of the import path behave the same way as they do in the instant rule (e.g. if ``././../foo.bar`` in the import path means ``./foo.bar``). Doubtful.

Also note, the "normalization" of the import path is not exactly the normalization referred to in the CLI path normalization, since it remains relative. Probably ok not to mention explicitly.

@cameel wanna take a quick look on the added `note`?

It's not the CLI normalization. The normalization is explicitly defined later in the same section:
>> The normalization rules are the same as for UNIX paths, namely:
>> - All the internal ``.`` segments are removed.
>> - Every internal ``..`` segment backtracks one level up in the hierarchy.
>> - Multiple slashes are squashed into a single one.

Doubtful.

Yes, the rule for `.` is implied by the fact that the import path is normalized. It's just that normalization can still leave leading `..` segments in the path. E.g. `.././../a//b/..//c/./d.sol` would be normalized to `../../a/c/d.sol` according to the rules stated in that section.

I think this whole confusion comes from the fact that the description does not explicitly say to remove these leading `..` segments from the import path before joining it with the prefix. I guess we can consider that a documentation bug.

Still, I don't think this PR is the best way to reword it. I have submitted my own, which fixes that and simplifies the whole description: #13572.
