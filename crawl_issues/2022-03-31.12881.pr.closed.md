# [\#12881 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12881) `closed`: Clarify what msize is in layout_in_memory.rst
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24279435?v=4" width="50">[aathan](https://github.com/aathan) opened issue at [2022-03-31 06:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12881):

The definition of msize() in the Yul documentation states  "size of memory, i.e. largest accessed memory index".

This could be interpreted to mean that the EVM keeps track of the largest pointer ever used to access memory. I think the word "accessed" there should probably be "allocated".

Since msize() is not introduced anywhere in the documentation of this PR, I went to find out what it was (guessing it was a low level Yul thing). Finding the "accessed" definition there left me wondering.

So, this PR introduces what msize() is (although, notably, without the `()` ... what's the desirable convention? Yul or opcode style names?) ... and also clarifies the problems that could happen.
