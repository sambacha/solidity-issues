fixes #11879 
fixes #13085

This is an early version of the changes needed to support literals conversion to dynamic arrays. Definitely it is not ready to review yet.

Things we should not forget to test:
 - assigning to storage
 - `x = [x[1], x[0]]`, where `x` is a multi-dimensional storage array

Interestingly, at a quick glance, the optimizer seems to be handling this rather well even for larger-than-16-elements-arrays (without having to use stack-to-memory).

Random idea for a syntax test on this:
```
function f(uint256[] memory x) {}
function f(uint256[3] memory x) {}
function g() {
  f([1]); // should work
  f([1,2,3]); // should fail (no unique function)
  f([1,2,3,4]); // should work
}
```
This should work already, but good to have a test for it.

Please note that I think it makes sense to re-unify this with tuple type again. For now, it helps to find places where it is used as an inline array, but in the end, they types are very similar, especially when we keep just putting things on the stack.

We should also have test cases for the following:
```
contract C {
        function f() public pure {
                uint8[3][] memory x = new uint8[3][](1);
                x[0] = [1,2,3];
        }
}
```
and
```
contract C {
        function f() public pure {
                uint8[][] memory x = new uint8[][](1);
                x[0] = [1,2,3];
        }
}
```
The former used to work before this PR, but I think the IR codegen LValue code still needs to be adjusted for this to work again.

Good point! Test cases added and code updated.

Summary of the optimizer problems: There should be an issue about it but I currently cannot find it.
The problem is the memory tracking inside DataFlowAnalyzer. For every memory write, it has to check if the memory write would overwrite any other memory state it has stored inside `m_state.memory`. If the memory mapping stays large, this can be quite expensive.
Two ways to overcome this come to my mind right now:
 - only make use of the memory mapping if the optimizer step deriving from DataFlowAnalyzer actually uses it
 - limit the size of the memory mapping
