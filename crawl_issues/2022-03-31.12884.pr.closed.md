I am about to submit a second PR that changes solidity/docs/assembly.rst and which references changes made in this PR. The two PRs should be accepted or rejected together. I am not confident enough in github PR management to merge them.

@cameel did you take over this PR?

No, I only did one review pass. I need to take another look after changes.

This needs a rebase and also there are some issues found by CI jobs:

```
Warning, treated as error:
/root/project/docs/internals/layout_in_memory.rst:51:undefined label: layout of arrays in memory

I read the rst spec and thought I saw that all section headings etc became labels automatically the :ref: is intended to point that section title a little lower down in the same doc. Not sure what I did wrong. Also, as a reminder, I have a second documentation PR that should be accepted at the same time as this one. #12888

I've incorporated all suggestions except changing "slot" to "word" because the original docs used "slot" and making that change would require changing it in many other places -- and I want to respect your time reviewing doc changes. So, minimizing the change surface.

@aathan I still have quite a few change suggestions so to avoid dragging out the review I just went ahead and reworded it the way I see it. I added subsections, (in particular I separated the descriptions of active memory and allocated memory), removed unnecessary repetition, replaced explicit addresses with corresponding names. I also fixed syntax issues with references and headings.

I squashed your commits but added my changes in new commits on top. This way you can still refer to your original text by looking at the first commit. Please check if you're fine with text after my modifications. If so, I'll squash it all into a single commit and merge. If not, you can add further changes on top and we'll continue with the review.

One thing that I think should be addressed is the use of the zero slot (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12884#discussion_r845241945). I'm not very familiar with code that manages it so I might be wrong but I thought that we were still using it?

Integrated changes from everyone's comments -- reduced the intro verbeage and removed "extremely brief"

Two small suggestions. If these are resolved, it looks mostly good from my end. Please also squash the commits so we can merge it afterwards @aathan

@hrkshnn I am not sure if this PR, which seems approved conceptually but not indicted in github as approved, needs any more work. If you'd please just quickly outline the (command line) steps required for me to "squash the commits so [you] can merge it" I'll do it.

(I think I know what to do, but I'd rather follow your cookbook and be sure therefore that it's done exactly right).

Thanks for teaching me to fish.

I just rebased this PR.
@cameel @hrkrshnn are there any more changes required?

We discussed this on the chat an we do not have consensus on merging it - there's a lot of redundancy and conflicting statements so the PR still needs more work. Unfortunately we're really flooded with PRs right now and we can't spend more time on improving this part of the docs. We have other priorities right now so I'm just going to close it. We might revisit this in the future.
