**Labels**: `medium effort`, `smt`

Currently the BMC engine completely disregards loops. It runs it once which doesn't do much. We could have a model checker option which allows users to give loop bounds that are applied to BMC (potentially to CHC too?). This is very common for Bounded Model Checkers like CBMC.
