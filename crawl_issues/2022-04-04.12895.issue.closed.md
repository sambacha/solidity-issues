**Labels**: `wasm`

Since Eth2 decided against ewasm, I think there's little reason for us to keep maintaining and developing the ewasm backend.
If people really want that, they can fork the compiler and maintain that in the fork.
If we need it again in the future, we can just revert the commits.

Thoughts?

+1 as well, ewasm doesn't make sense to continue development on if it's not being planned on being used, and keeping it in the Solidity compiler only adds more legacy code to manage

Haha, this one here I'm reopening, though :-). This here is the justification for closing all the others - but we haven't actually removed the backend just yet :-).
