Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12851.
``test/cmdlineTests.sh`` has grown more and more complicated over time - I'd say it's time to consider making it a python script and rewriting it nicely.
This would for example allow to easily filter by its sub-test-suites and individual tests, etc.

On the other hand it shares logic with other script, so whether this is a good idea may depend on whether we want to transition them as well.

I think it's a good idea and here's the plan for doing it I came up with with @Marenz last year:
1) Add support for a new kind of CLI test - one that has a Python or Bash script inside.
2) Split the [Bash tests that are currently tacked on at the end of `cmdlineTests.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/test/cmdlineTests.sh#L291-L674) into such smaller tests.
    - When naming dirs for these tests use a prefix to makes them sort at the end to much the current behavior (they currently run after all the other tests and I think we want to keep it that way since they can be long). `~` is a good candidate for such a prefix.
3) Rewrite the smaller scripts in Python.
4) Rewrite `cmdlineTests.sh` in Python.

I actually have an old branch where I did (1) and started (2). I'm going to assign myself here for now since I'd like to finish that when I have time. Then (3) and (4) could be done piece by piece.

@cameel you self-assigned this, but we already have soo many PRs (you've 10 open ones). Let's try to close them first? :-)

I assigned this because I already started working on this last year. There just was no issue for this back then but I have a branch with (1) and (2) almost done. I had to switch to more important tasks but if we're doing this then I want to update that branch and submit it as a PR when we're done with PR squashing.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
