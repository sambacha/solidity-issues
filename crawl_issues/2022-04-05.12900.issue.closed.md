Depends on #9720.
Depends on #12707.

The source archives be post on github release page should be tested. Here's what we agreed on so far:
- Currently [our CI config forces a release build with `FORCE_RELEASE: ON`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.13/.circleci/config.yml#L782-L786). This should be changed so that release jobs create a source archive using `git archive` and build a release from that.
- We want to eventually have a ninja build job (#12707). This would also be a good way to test the other mechanism for building a release - based on tags.
- We should have a job for testing the PPA builds as well (from a source archive).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
