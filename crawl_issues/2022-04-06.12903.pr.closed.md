Meant to confirm https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12902 in a CI run [although unfortunately at the time of writing there is a major CircleCI outage...]

~~Ok - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23558/workflows/947d5e09-6e83-474a-a3f0-5fd9e5310b50/jobs/1034581 just passed, so an MSVC debug build *with* https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12902 passes (taking 13 minutes, i.e. - surpisingly - no runtime overhead for the debug build apparently - might actually be that I need to change the cmake settings instead or in addition)~~ [The initial run was still a release build.]

I'll now remove https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12902 to see that this indeed triggers the expected crash.

https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23565/workflows/a529bd2d-59e9-4163-ab1d-df60e598fbf1/jobs/1034885 confirms the issue on develop.

Since the earlier run was still a release build, I'm now actually confirming https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12902 in https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23567/workflows/41a0c740-63bc-41a8-b22e-493b360c391c/jobs/1034962. It looks like it will pass, but now, as expected, the runtime increases significantly - from the current looks it'll probably take ~1h...

Yeah, ok https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23567/workflows/41a0c740-63bc-41a8-b22e-493b360c391c/jobs/1034962 was too slow eventually timed out, but it had one full successful ``soltest`` pass before, so I'd consider it good enough evidence :-).
