Our translation repositories in [solidity-docs ](https://github.com/solidity-docs) only preserve the `docs/` directory from the main repository. The problem is that the script we use to build the documentation is currently under [`scripts/docs.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/docs.sh) so it cannot be easily used by translators to render the docs locally. It would be better to have this script in `docs/`.

- [ ] Move the script.
- [ ] Adjust CI and paths for the new location.
