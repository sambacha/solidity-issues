Added OS specific local files .DS_Store (macOS) and Thumbs.db (Windows) that often sneak their way in when not explicitly included in the .gitignore file

Ah, wait. There are some weird merge commits in your branch. Can you rebase on `develop` and squash them?

A more concrete commit description would also be nice - i.e. in what specifically got changed about `.gitignore`. Only saying that it updates `.gitignore` is a bit useless because that's obvious from the file list.
