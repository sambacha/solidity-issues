Fixes #12152 

- Added macro [DEFINE_METHOD_CHECK](https://github.com/justunkn/solidity/blob/issue_12152/Generalized_FlagSet_class/libsolutil/pch.h#L26) to generate meta functions to check existance of method in a given class
- Added [FlagSet](https://github.com/justunkn/solidity/blob/issue_12152/Generalized_FlagSet_class/libsolutil/FlagSet.h#L54) generalized class implementation
- All of listed classes except [OptimiserSettings](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.10/libsolidity/interface/OptimiserSettings.h) are refactored by inheriting class

@cameel btw, do you have any suggestions why the ci checking of the PR is still not completed?

@justunkn if you want to resume working on it later, feel free to reopen. For the time being I'm closing this since we're flooded with PRs and this not a critical roadmap feature (it's just a "nice to have") so it does not make much sense for us to take over and finish it ourselves.
