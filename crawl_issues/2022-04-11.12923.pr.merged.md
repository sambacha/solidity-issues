The `b_ubu` job seems to be failing due to resource constraints. CircleCI runs it on your account with less memory than it needs and the process gets killed.

This seems to be because CircleCI runs it on your account rather than our org account. This seems to often happen with external PRs. Maybe you can try to log into CircleCI with your github account and unfollow your fork? See also [Why aren't pull requests triggering jobs on my organization?](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008097173-Why-aren-t-pull-requests-triggering-jobs-on-my-organization-). If that does not help, in the end we can always retrigger CI manually, but it would be more convenient if just worked for you.

Thanks @cameel for your valuable comment, I have updated the pull request and unfollow my fork, how can we trigger the build again?

oh well... I triggered the build by making a branch in on the same commit in the main repo. All checks should complete now.

@super1ha1 Are you still interested in working on this?

@cameel do you think this can be merged soon? Otherwise I'd close it

@nishant-sachdeva Can you take it over? It only requires squashing commits and then we can merge.

`Fix spelling mistakes and CI spellcheck job`? :) Something went wrong here...

BTW, when squashing please make sure to preserve the author of the original commit for later attribution in the release notes. I see that you got @Marenz for some reason even though I think he had nothing to do with this PR :)
