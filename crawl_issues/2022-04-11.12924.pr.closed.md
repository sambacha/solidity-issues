# [\#12924 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12924) `closed`: Invalidate dependency cache on macOS in CI
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Restoring cache in macOS jobs takes ~17 minutes. See for example [recent `b_osx` run on `develop`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23649/workflows/01a8fe85-debd-4892-874c-2745e02c10cc/jobs/1038415). There are lots of errors about symlinks being skipped, which might have something to do with it:
```
...
Skipping writing "usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/env.rb: permission denied
Skipping writing "usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb" - open /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler/environment_preserver.rb: permission denied
Skipping writing "usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.8/lib/ruby/2.6.0/bundler
...
```

I think that the Homebrew in CircleCI's image must have been updated and the errors might be because we're restoring our cached, older version. If that's the case, cache invalidation should help.

How can you tell ;-)? The cache hasn't actually been used yet in CI!

I always self-assign PRs I'm working on because then I can easily filter the PR list. It's pretty useful when I want to see the list of my active PRs or when I want to check what's there to review. The author field is not always reliable for that because we sometimes take over PRs.

Looks like the issue persists... so maybe we should just remove the cache for now...

Yeah, It's already taking 4+ minutes in [1039262](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23665/workflows/001ee0f9-1bad-4319-8865-7239d66c0dcf/jobs/1039262).

Interestingly, this time cache restore took ~12 min. Not sure if it just fluctuates or if the PR actually helped but it's still much more than installing it from scratch unfortunately.

Closing this in favor of #12926.
