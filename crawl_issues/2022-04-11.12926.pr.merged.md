Replaces #12924.

Looks like invalidating the cache does not fix the problem so I added an issue to figure it out later (#12925) and here I'm disabling the cache for now as a temporary workaround.

It seemed that disabling caching revealed some breakage:
```
./.circleci/soltest.sh: line 39: realpath: command not found
```

but after looking into it, it's just that the `t_osx` jobs assumed that `b_osx` will always create cache that can be restored. Now that it's gone, they don't use cache but don't install these dependencies either.

To fix that I made all osx jobs consistently use `steps_install_dependencies_osx`. This also makes disabling easier - it needs to be done just in one place.
