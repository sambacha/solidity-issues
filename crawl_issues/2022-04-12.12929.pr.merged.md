Replaces #12181.
Closes #9933.

This is a simplified version of #12181 (as discussed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12181#pullrequestreview-882043322). Turns out it's possible to do it via workspace after all.

It's not complete automation of the publishing process as stated in #9933 but it at least takes care of the most tedious and error prone part of the process so I think it's good enough.

The PR adds a CI job that gathers release binaries from other jobs and attaches them as artifacts, under two naming conventions - for github release page and for solc-bin.

Looks like it works. Removing the debug commit.

For reference, here's a successful run: [1040499](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/23697/workflows/dc5b77e3-ee4b-4c78-8f76-4469ff514767/jobs/1040499/artifacts)

I switched to creating a tarball so that the executable flag is preserved. Here are the artifacts from a successful run: [1058937/artifacts](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24104/workflows/cf0ba70a-6930-40d5-9e2e-c83224fe241b/jobs/1058937/artifacts). Now I'm removing the debug commit that enables this job outside of releases.
