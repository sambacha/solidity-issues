# [\#12938 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12938) `merged`: Script for keeping main branches of external test repos in sync with upstream
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Some time ago when the upstream of the [perpetual-pools-contracts](https://github.com/solidity-external-tests/perpetual-pools-contracts) repo became unavailable I created forks of all our external tests, even those where we use upstream directly. This way we'll be able to switch to the fork when this happens again. Keeping these forks up to date is a hassle though. Today I created a new fork for the recently merged #12562 so I though I'd also create a script to automated updating it.

It would probably be a good idea to have this run automatically in the nightly CI run. In this PR I'm only including the script thought since that would require setting up tokens in CI to be able to push to `solidity-external-docs` org.
