This fixes [#12856](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12856).

~I've made a small change to ObjectParser as part of this to set the `.subId` fields as they didn't seem to be set anywhere.~

This is my first contribution to this project so be aware of that when reviewing the changes.

This looks good in general, but I think we are getting some complications due to the feature that we can select a single sub-object to run on. Is this actually needed? Also I didn't take a look at the output yet, but could you check that if the object is only a single object with only code, that it prints the code without the object?

Thanks for the review! I've addressed your comments and made sure that the output for a code block is still a code block. I can't comment on the utility of the `<object>` flag myself. The author of the issue might be able to. At this point the implementation for that feature is a pretty neat chunk of code that doesn't call anything weird.

This is still waiting for reviews. Any team member that sees this message is welcome to review it.

@dflupu heya, do you plan on continuing work on this? We're actively working on reducing the number of open PRs, and I'd like to know where we stand with this, so we can decide whether to have someone from the team to take it over, or to close it.

I'll address the comments by the end of the week.

I think I've covered everything. Feel free to review again.

Heya @dflupu, thanks for picking this up again :)
A couple of pointers for future reference - when someone leaves a comment, and the fix is trivial and doesn't require a discussion (e.g. rename of a variable name), please don't leave a comment in the thread (i.e. done, fixed, etc.) as it this will send a ton of notifications and is generally annoying; in such cases, feel free to just click on resolve conversation.
Second - I've not taken a detailed look, but you've got a couple of strange failures, which will most likely be resolved if you rebase against the fresh upstream develop (e.g. the `b_archlinux` is failing due to a Z3 dependency version which was bumped some time ago).

@nikola-matic Okay! I've rebased it.

> I think it is good, just need to squash commits and rebase.

I've squashed the two fixup commits and rebase against develop. I'll give another review as well, and @matheusaaguiar, in the meantime, you can slap another approve if you're still OK with this, since the force push dismissed it.

Also, as far as squashing everything into one commit - I guess we can just use the `squash and merge` option.

@cameel I noticed that you were reviewing this work in another branch: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commits/yulopti-object-support and decided to apply the suggestions there that still make sense in the current state of the PR! Thanks a lot ;)

~The only one that I didn't apply was the change suggested in this commit: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/f34171f8063d1939fd73b525ac5d76267f28b2ed because I use some `std::string` methods like `find_last_of` and `substr` to determine the name of the target subobject, so if we change the function to receive a `YulString` instead of `std::string` we would need to make conversions between them inside `subObjectAt` anyway. But it would be consistent with the other methods...so yeah, maybe we should change it indeed.~. I decided to apply it as well ;)

@cameel there's still a CR from your side on this PR (from Nov 9th).

I'll give it a final look tomorrow.
