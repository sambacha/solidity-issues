# [\#12948 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12948) `closed`: Get rid of MSVC message "The contents of <span> are available only with C++20 or later."
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2022-04-20 05:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12948):

MSVC `<span>` header contains
```
#if !_HAS_CXX20
#pragma message("The contents of <span> are available only with C++20 or later.")
. . . .
```
and shows the message if the header gets compiled with earlier version of C++.

`range-v3` includes `<span>` if it is available (e.g. in `range/v3/range/concepts.h`):
```
#ifdef __has_include
#if __has_include(<span>)
#include <span>
#endif
```

That leads to 204 messages during MSVC compilation.

`range-v3` [has a fix](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/commit/2a3f9cb999), but it is not in the release. This PR applies corresponding patch.

I'm not very happy introducing a new `patches` directory, and not fully convinced it worth troubles. But a repeating compilation message is also annoying.

Looks like there was a release just before the fix went into `master` (August 2020) and then releases stopped. It's about time for a new one and there's even an issue asking for that: https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/issues/1694.

The patch is not that big though so I actually would not mind it that much as long as we'd be able to remove it soon.

@cameel @christianparpart I rebased. Note however that there is recent activity in the linked task. We should keep monitoring it.

@cameel @christianparpart 
New version of `range-v3` is released. Perhaps we should update and if the message `"The contents of <span> are available only with C++20 or later."` does not appear any longer, close this PR.

Yeah, we definitely should update it! Created an issue: #13242.

Ranges-v3 updated (#13242) so I'm closing this. Let me know if it turns out that this did not really fix the problem but hopefully that was all we needed.
