Currently, in the Voting example on the Solidity documentation, anonymous accounts who don't have voting rights may call the `delegate` function of the `Ballot` contract.

To fix the issue, the statement
```solidity
require(sender.weight != 0, "You have no right to vote");
```
at the beginning of the `delegate` function is necessary.

Rebased to get CI checks to pass. I need some docs change for the translation bot. Looks like `b_archlinux` is required so I won't be able to merge this though.
