The list of downloadable formats in [0.8.13 docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) (and also older versions, down to 0.8.9) seems broken:

For older releases and for `latest` the links are there:

It might be somehow related to changes we did in #12238, though I'm not certain about that. The biggest change was the move of the downloads section above the versions list and in 0.8.9 that change was still not present:

I can't seem to see this bug. I already tried all the versions mentioned.

@cameel Indeed, the download sections are not empty in the docs' versions mentioned here. I don't see the bug either.

Great! We can close it then. I guess it must have been something on RTD side.
