# [\#12966 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12966) `merged`: Fix ICE caused by an immutable struct with mapping

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60588784?v=4" width="50">[a3d4](https://github.com/a3d4) opened issue at [2022-04-28 02:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12966):

Fixes #12953.

The ICE was introduced as a side effect of 7c0a121e456b966826afe575929bad225aa0cb15, see 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/7c0a121e456b966826afe575929bad225aa0cb15#diff-0e0e69b13aacc21916c6074c34a2ee68a0118b5914767495870c13b383061a94R135.

It makes `DocStringAnalizer` dependent on `TypeProvider`, which requires `TypeChecker`.

Moving `DocStringAnalyser` after `TypeCherker` fixes the ICE. Is it somewhat OK or too invasive?

@Marenz The ICE seems to be related to your commit. Could you have a look at the PR please?

I would prefer a way that we only conditionally query the type, but I couldn't find any good conditions.. In that light, I think your approach is fine. You probably need to rebase for the CI though.

LGTM but needs rebasing again and CI fixes

Rebasing alone should do it - that should also fix CI (the failures are just CI running out-of-memory and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12907 upped the CI resources for those runs)

@ekpyron, @Marenz I have rebased changes. You can continue a review.
