Yea will rebase it now that the tests were merged

I have just pushed a slightly different workaround for the issue. I moved the git config change to `docker_upgrade.sh` since that's the script that is aware where the repo comes from and who owns it. The build scripts should not be concerned with that. Other than that, it still does the same thing, i.e. marks the dir as safe.

I also found the answer for why this is needed: https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/
The new option was added very recently due to a security issue. This explains why it's only failing now.

Yeah, but that's after we merge this right?

BTW, I just rebased it on develop to make the failing archlinux soltest job pass. So we'll get new hashes in a moment.

Shouldn't it be the same hashes as the last ones posted?

The docker images are already published anyway, whether we merge this or not. So we'd usually create another PR using the hashes here, and when everything works there, we merge both of them.

Would be nice if they were but the build process is not that deterministic unfortunately.

OK, we can do it that way too. I guess this way we'll know for sure that CI passes with these images.

@leo Wait, I just noticed that the hashes that are in `develop` are already for the bumped versions we have here. So what really happened? I thought this PR was on top of what is already in `develop` but looks like it must have been done first, hashes updated and then merged without merging this first?

I'm not sure if I should now just update the hashes without updating versions or bump the versions and rebuild again?

The other PR, the one that uses the hashes from here, is usually merged first. It was merged assuming this one was fine

Unfortunately looks like I can't bump versions because `upgrade_docker.sh` has a check that enforces increase by one. Well, let's just merge them with the current versions: #13012.
