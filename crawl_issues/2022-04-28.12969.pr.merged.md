Currently Eldarica can only be used via solc-js's callback, which is not great. This PR adds support to call Eldarica via its binary if installed in the system.

Should this still be a draft? Many tests seem to be failing.

Thanks for the review @cameel . I haven't had time to look at the first one yet, but will try to look at the whole thing this week.

Sure, no hurry, I'm at a hackathon now so I won't be able to go back to it before Monday anyway :) At least I finally managed to digest it all.

Overall I didn't find many serious problems - mostly the bug that CI was crashing on, rest are small things so we should be able to get this merged quckly once I'm back.

@cameel @ekpyron can we decide in a sync way what to do with the tests here? I don't wanna try different things that might be rejected, just wanna make a decision before.

Ok it's now fixed with the SMT command callback and the Universal callback as class members.
@cameel lmk if fine then I'll squash.
