# [\#12970 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12970) `closed`: Solidity summit 2022 (Amsterdam) slide feature non-value immutables.

Not exactly documentation, but [slide #5 of @chriseth's presentation at the Solidity summit](https://chriseth.github.io/notes/talks/summit_2022/#/5) includes 

```
string public immutable name = "MyToken";
```

Unlike the immutable array, this is not marked as "not available yet" ... but it doesn't appear to work with 0.8.13.

Maybe it would be nice to update the slide to clarify that point.

Ah, thanks a lot! Should be fixed now.
