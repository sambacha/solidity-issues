This fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10688

I'm not sure about the placement of these rules, it just seemed like they should be somewhere above the following rule: `Replace MOD X, <power-of-two> with AND X, <power-of-two> - 1`

Let me rebase this to see if the tests pass.

I have rebased changes to make clear what still needs to be fixed.

The assertion hit by the tests is ``libevmasm/CommonSubexpressionEliminator.cpp:L386`` - I'd actually say that it's not worth the effort to actually implement that part for legacy code generation - so the easiest solution to this would be to only add these simplification rules for via-IR code generation (which would require passing that down as a flag to the rule list generation).

Thanks for clarifying! The output wasn't really telling me much.

I could make that change. Do you have a name in mind for the flag? And do you recommend passing that flag down to each `simplificationRuleListPart` or just adding another "Part" that is wrapped in an if statement?

I notice that there's a few rules, `evmRuleList` to be specific, that are added if the `_evmVersion` is set (it is only set from libyul).  I figure that there is the option of making use of that. The only issue is that those rules are added at the end.

Ah, right! I didn't realize myself that we don't set the evm version for legacy code generation. In that case, it makes sense to just reuse that. You can add a flag only to the rule list ``Part`` in which you add the new rules only and set it based on ``_evmVersion.has_value()``. As for a name, maybe something like ``_forYulOptimizer``.

I'd also add a comment before conditionally adding the new rules stating something like:
```
// The libevmasm optimizer does not support rules resulting in opcodes with more than two arguments.
```

@ekpyron Looks like that solved it! Tests are passing now ðŸ™Œ

We'll still need a changelog entry for this - apart from that I think we can merge.

I've added changelog entries as well. Feel free to edit if necessary.
