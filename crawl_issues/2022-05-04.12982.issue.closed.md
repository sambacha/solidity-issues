<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).

## Abstract

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

When a function doesn't exist in a contract, the contract simply reverts. It's quite frequent that devs jumble up contract addresses while interacting with the contracts (on the client-side), and they just see a `execution reverted` error which might not be helpful for someone in this situation for the first time.

## Motivation

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

But if some data is included (like a 4 bytes selector), it'd help libraries like ethers to show a better error. (related discussion https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2958). I understand this would not help with existing deployed contracts but in the long term this might be helpful.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

Solidity may revert with something like this, instead of no revert data.

```solidity
error FunctionNotFound();
```

## Backwards Compatibility

There should be no issues.

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I faced this exact problem two days ago at a hackathon, my selector was wrong and I was trying to debug somewhere else. I think it would be great if this feature could be supported in Solidity, maybe some error code through `Panic`. I propose to reopen this issue if you also think it can add some value.

@zemse It's actually already a feature. If you pass `--revert-strings debug` to the compiler, the compiler will always include a message in the reverts it generates. If you call a function that does not exist, you should get:
```
Contract does not have fallback nor receive functions
```

You can see all the messages applicable to your code if you request the `--ir` output and look at the `revert_error_...()` functions.

The selector is not included, but that's a part of the input, so when you know the reason behind he revert, you should be able to easily get it from the tool, without having to embed that info in the contract. We also have `--revert-strings verboseDebug` variant, where we could include that info, but looks like it was never actually implemented. I think there just wasn't much demand for that.

This was added before custom errors were a thing so it uses free-form strings, but I'd say that we should definitely switch to custom errors with well defined codes. That's #11664, which I think should be reopened.

It is great that there's a debug option. But is it possible to include a Panic or Error code even in optimised runtime code (similar to overflow errors)?

Yeah, that's what #11664 was about. @ekpyron can we reopen it?

Yeah https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11664 should have stayed open... we can we close this as falling under https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11664 then, though, right?
