I guess it needs a rebase for the smt tests?

Also, do we not have tests for this?!

Technically, it's an ICE and we don't test for ICEs, since we usually fix them instead :-D...
Although we might want to think about dragging a proper error reporter to codegen for this... then we could also start emitting info messages about stack limit evasion and such...

Damn, I thought I merged this before the release... merging it now anyways - we can still do more cosmetics afterwards, but we should definitely have this suggestion in general...
