# [\#12994 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12994) `merged`: LSP to resolve custom include paths (e.g. Hardhat)
**Labels**: `language server`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2022-05-09 14:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12994):

This PR is WIP, but it will fix #12833 later on.

Big question is, how do we want to tell `solc --lsp` where to look for include paths. I remember there was some project file format that does include that information, but what was that? @cameel, do you remember?

### Checklist:

- [x] factor our file path resolving in FileRepository: `tryResolvePath(.)`
- [x] fix `sourceUnitNameToUri()` by making use of new path resolver.
- [x] custom include paths via JSON settings object
- [x] always add `{projectRoot}/node_modules` to include paths (vscode-solidity is doing that too and users are used to it)

Do you mean the dappfile ([EIP 82](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/82))? Or one of the config files actually used by frameworks?

ah right thanks! Dappfile is what I remembered, but this time, I in fact meant a framework that introduced a file that is now also supported by another one. I am talking vaguely because I forgot the names. ;-(

I might look into Dappfile though.

@cameel if we can't come up with something immediately, what do you think about adding a CLI option, such as `--lsp-search-paths PATH,...`. NB: We once agreed in explicitly not messing with standard-json or related CLI args, as these are in fact two different topics, IIRC.

Oh, you meant `remappings.txt` (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12603). But it's not really for include paths. It's for remappings (though in practice they get used to get the same effect).

Why not just support `--include-paths` instead of adding a new arg?

I can do that. thanks. But I am still hoping for some kind of auto-configuration, where users do not need to do too much.

Suppose you are working in more than one project, and they all do not necessarily share the same include paths.

I think we could auto-detect at least the well known frameworks and adjust the include paths accordingly (on top of manually added ones, if added). What do you think, @cameel ?

I'm not really convinced that this should be baked into the compiler. It will lead to weird behavior in corner cases, when you're not on the "happy path" with a well supported framework and old compiler binaries will be less usable with new frameworks. I think we should instead give frameworks a way to provide this info to the compiler. I think that some non-framework-specific config file that the LSP expects to find under the base path might be a better idea.

`t_win_soltest` is failing. And I just noticed that it runs LSP tests, which I didn't expect. I think this was originally a separate step and it made more sense that way. Then you can tell just from the job name what failed - I wouldn't even bother looking inside if I saw it's a failing LSP test in a LSP-related PR. And with this running after soltest, you have to first wait 20+ minutes for the Windows binary, and then 15+ minutes for soltest to finish. You'd get feedback much faster if this ran independently.

Hi, just had this problem on nvim with newly installed version of `solc` using `brew`. 
```Version: 0.8.15+commit.e14f2714.Darwin.appleclang```

Wanted to check if this is released already or not.

Edit: Checked and the commit with hash `e14f2714` thus the `v0.8.15` was released on Jun 15th which is before this merge. Is this going to be included in `0.8.16`?

Yes, this will go into 0.8.16, which we are releasing tomorrow.
