# [\#12995 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12995) `closed`: Feature: `print(...)`
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

## Abstract

A variadic function `print(...)` that would emit a `log*` with `abi` encoded data of its arguments.

## Motivation
It's typical for testing frameworks / debugging setups to have some way to print the value of variables.

For Hardhat, this is [`console.log`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-core/console.sol). For dapptools and foundry, this is [`log_uint` etc](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-test/blob/master/src/test.sol#L22-L36).


## Specification

The (dapptools / foundry) implementation is fairly simple. `print(a, b, c)` is equivalent to emitting the following `bytes`: `abi.encode(a, b, c)`. However, testing tools would want to know how to decode this. Therefore, the first (or perhaps the second?) topic should be a marker for the types. This can probably be emitted in the JSON output for ABI. The tool can then lookup the hash to understand the types and do a `abi.decode` to get back the data.


For hardhat implementation, it seems to do a `staticcall` to a magic address. This is an alternative to consider for implementation.

We should also consider introducing a `--debug` flag. Where compiler would warn about `print` if `--debug` flag is not set.

For comparison, there is `print` in Vyper: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/2818 modelled after `console.log` in hardhat.

Logs are problematic because they are erased on revert, the optimizer might even remove `print`s before a `revert`.
If we want to do this, we need a special debugging EVM / a special opcode whose effects are not erased by revert.

I don't think this is an issue. Just need to change this in the VM. I believe these tools are already doing it.

Good point. Maybe a good use for a `--debug` flag.

Conclusion from the meeting: the team wants this to be solved using generics rather than having inbuilt functions.

Regarding a `--debug` flag (or something alike), this could still be useful for solving issues in testing. For example, the optimizer assuming that the value of `block.timestamp` is the same throughout a transaction.

Will close.

Tiny addition: This is a good contender for the standard library, so I think it should be "built in" at least in some sense.

@chriseth Are we sure generics can really solve this?

This is an example of what I'm doing:

```solidity
        emit log_named_uint("returndatasize: ", rds);
        emit log_named_uint("offset: ", a);
        emit log_named_uint("length: ", b);
        emit log_named_bytes32("data: ", c);
```

I suspect we'll need to have variadic arguments (with generic args) to solve this (let's say I want to do `print("first", a, "second", b)`)   I'm not too keen on seeing variadic args in solidity.

Also more importantly, being able to print a struct (a json serialization of the struct) would be perfect.

It can be solved in rust, so it should also be doable in solidity.
Why would you like to have variadic args for print, but not for user defined functions?
