We need to support this for z3 4.8.16.

We should have this before the release.

Should this get a changelog entry?

Not sure this one needs a changelog entry though. It's not user facing.

Isn't it? I haven't read through the trigger for this yet, but won't this break the counterexamples if you use e.g. solc 0.8.13 with dynamically loaded recent z3?

solc 0.8.13 actually crashes if you dynamically load Z3 4.8.16. We discussed this earlier on the chat and I think we should treat it as ABI incompatibility. Basically, older solc versions support only Z3 <= 4.8.14. I think Z3 should have released this as 4.9.

Yea ok. Will add changelog entry and write something in the docs.

So I think it's ok to merge when you add the changelog entry/docs.

Since newer solc versions will (if I understood things correctly) still keep working with Z3 < 4.8.16, a changelog entry alone should be fine... not much we can do about older solc versions breaking with newer Z3, but yeah, that's z3's fault for doing something like this without bumping the so version...

yea but doesn't hurt adding it to the docs, people might be confused/annoyed if it happens
