This looks very good already!

About the tests: I think you fixed it so that both abi encoders (v1 and v2) behave in the same way. In this case, you can move the test file somewhere else and remove the "pragma abicoder", because then the test framework will automatically run both encoders on it.

You need a rebase on develop also, cus we updated the z3 version and CI build is failing

The previous version also avoided the mstore, but it's probably better to optimize for the case where the length is not zero. The current version is cheaper in that case, is it?

The previous version used `if( gt( length, 0) )` which would be 10 (`if`) + 3 (`gt`) = 13 gas addition to avoid the mstore for length zero. It would also add an assignment (`ret := pos`) before the `if`.
Current version adds 5 (`mul`) + 6(`iszero` x 2) = 11 gas.
So I think the current version is cheaper for the case when length is **not**  zero. When the length is indeed zero, it will do the mstore anyway, but It should cost only 1 gas more than doing the `if(gt(...)` operation: 3 (`mstore`) + 5 (`mul`) + 6(`iszero` x 2) = 14. Right?

Also, after reading https://github.com/wolflo/evm-opcodes/blob/main/gas.md#a0-1-memory-expansion I guess that the mstore operation for length zero could cost 0 gas, right?
Edit: Actually, after reading it again, I see that it does not mean that...

The constants also cost and the assignment is probably also not free - without thinking through it completely, I'm pretty sure the non-branching version is better :-).
