https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13006 was a quick hack to restore compilation against gcc 12.

Once a newer boost version with proper gcc 12 compatibility (without warnings) is released, we can revisit this (and either make the workaround conditional depending on the boost version or bump the minimum required version of boost, at least in the presence of gcc 12).

On the other hand, it'll be a bit of a mess no matter what. We could also try to figure out why gcc does not consider boost system headers and ignores warnings in them by default.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I don't think we should be just closing all technical debt issues like this one.
