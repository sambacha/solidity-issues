# [\#13010 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13010) `merged`: Re-enable the optimized IR preset in all external tests
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Closes #12343.

The new feature for moving variables to memory released in 0.8.13 should have fixed this. This PR re-enables the last few tests where the optimized preset used to be disabled due to "Stack too deep" errors.

We mainly wanted to know if they compile without stack-too-deeps now - and they do. What's failing is just the tests, which is most probably just due to hardhat's heuristics (and/or similar stuff) and (hopefully) just involves disabling some tests.

So this is a good thing already ;-).

Ah nice!

Yeah, I'm going to patch these tests after the release and we'll be able to merge this.

I have disabled the failing tests. As expected it looks like https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2115 and https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2453 are the cause.

Note that we now have a new, unrelated failure on `develop` that @matheusaaguiar is investigating: [1068599](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24304/workflows/9f72146d-e6dd-4dac-84e6-02deb1c95791/jobs/1068599). That one will still fail here.
