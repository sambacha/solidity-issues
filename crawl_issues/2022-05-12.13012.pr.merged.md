# [\#13012 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13012) `merged`: Switch to newly built buildpack-deps images with Z3 4.8.16 in CI

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-05-12 12:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13012):

This PR updates the CI config to use the images built by #12967.

Note that it reuses the same version numbers. This is because #12967 was supposed to go in together with the last hash update. It did not (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12967#issuecomment-1123767724) and now it has extra changes so the images are different. We decided to bump the versions once more just in case but unfortunately I can't do that because [`docker_upgrade.sh` will only accept increasing version by one](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/0c0ff4fce6ad80e78a5b995248f1b9b469f99d5d/scripts/ci/docker_upgrade.sh#L41-L43).
