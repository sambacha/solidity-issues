To add some context to this PR: we're reverting #12861 because it turned out that there are projects that actually use `RETURNDATACOPY` in pure functions. We're going to merge that feature into `breaking` instead.

> Looks good. But please squash the corrections into the original commit. Our general practice is for each commit to be a single logical change, without changing things back and forth. This keeps history easier to understand.

(I'd usually use ``git rebase -i develop`` for that, in case you're wondering; that'll open up an editor with some comments which explain the rest)
