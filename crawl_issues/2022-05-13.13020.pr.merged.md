# [\#13020 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13020) `merged`: Workaround for `getStorageAt()` bug in Hardhat 2.9.5 for gnosis external test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Gnosis external test started failing due to and extra sanity check introduced by [Hardhat 2.9.5](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/releases/tag/hardhat%402.9.5):

> Besides that, now the `eth_getStorageAt` method is spec-compliant. This means that the storage slot argument **must** have a length of 32 bytes (a hex-encoded, 0x-prefixed string of length 66).

This makes gnosis job fail in some PRs. E.g. [1059920](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24123/workflows/55bf989e-120b-4f1d-8cd5-9f0a6e23b716/jobs/1059920):
```
 1) Migration
       migrate
         can migrate:
     InvalidArgumentsError: Errors encountered in param 1: Storage slot argument must have a length of 66 ("0x" + 32 bytes), but '0x6' has a length of 3
```

I have submitted an upstream fix (https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/pull/404) but unfortunately Hardhat has a bug and does not really accept properly padded storage address either (https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2709).

For now the simplest workaround is to stay at 2.9.4.

Gnosis test passed so I'll rebase.
