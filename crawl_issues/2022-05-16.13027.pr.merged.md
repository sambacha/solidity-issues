# [\#13027 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13027) `merged`: Workaround for problems caused by forcing ethers@5.6.1 in external tests
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-05-16 15:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13027):

In #12868 we had to downgrade ethers.js to 5.6.1 in several external projects because later versions break handling of revert expectations in Hardhat tests (see https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2849). This worked fine until ethers released a new version of its scoped package called `@ethersproject/contracts`. ethers 5.6.1 is hard-coded to use the older version of that package while other packages may pull in a newer one, causing errors like in [1061741](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24148/workflows/a50dbf0e-7e4a-4bcd-848a-66c116394c4a/jobs/1061741):
```
test/migration/subTests.spec.ts:42:48 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'import("/tmp/ext-test-Gnosis-Safe-hDC41T/ext/node_modules/@ethersproject/contracts/lib/index").Contract' is not assignable to parameter of type 'import("/tmp/ext-test-Gnosis-Safe-hDC41T/ext/node_modules/ethers/node_modules/@ethersproject/contracts/lib/index").Contract'.
```

This is the case in Gnosis and Perpetual Pools external tests. The package that pulls in newer version is hardhat-deploy in this case (at least for Gnosis). The workaround is to force `@ethersproject/contracts` back to 5.6.0.

**EDIT**: Perpetual Pools fails with `@ethersproject/contracts@5.6.0` ([1062656](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24183/workflows/2d2f0f7e-1d3e-43c1-882d-d4c87be7033f/jobs/1062656)):
```

           Rotates the observations array:

      AssertionError: expected [ …(24) ] to deeply equal [ …(24) ]
      + expected - actual
```

This appears to be a problem with the `.to.deep.eq()` matcher due to some version mismatch. I checked this and the values are actually exactly the same. I did not manage to figure out why the comparison fails. I suspected the fact that both `ethers@5.6.1` and `ethers@5.6.6` get installed but after forcing 5.6.1 in all transitive dependencies the problem still persisted.

Fortunately it turned out that the Perpetual Pools test no longer needs the workaround from #12868 and all tests pass with `ethers@5.6.6`. I suspect this might be because we disabled the tests that used to fail (probably due to failing Hardhat heuristics). In any case the solution was to remove that older workaround in this test.

### Details
Here's a more detailed explanation of this dependency hell in case anyone is curious:

- Hardhat does not work with ethers.js >= 5.6.2. As a workaround we're pinning it to 5.6.1 in our ext test scripts.
- ethers.js has a bunch of tiny scoped packages. One of them is `@ethersproject/contracts`. Apparently these do not have to be explicitly listed in [its `package.json`](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/blob/master/package.json) but still show up as dependencies in the package published to npm.
- ethers.js 5.6.1 published to npm depends on `@ethersproject/contracts@5.6.0` - exactly that version.
- Gnosis depends on `hardhat-deploy`, which [has a dependency on `ethers@^5.5.3`](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy/blob/master/package.json#L67).
- When published to npm, hardhat-deploy somehow depends directly on these scoped packages rather than on `ethers`.
- It depends on `@ethersproject/contracts@^5.4.1`, which pulls in the latest version.
- Until 2 days ago the latest version of `@ethersproject/contracts` published to npm was 5.6.0. So both projects pulled that version as a dependency and all was fine.
- Now there's `@ethersproject/contracts@5.6.1` available. hardhat-deploy pulls that one while `ethers@5.6.1` we install pulls version 5.6.0. We get an error because TypeScript sees two different definitions of the `Contract` class.

By the way, I think this problem exists only when you install older ethers the way we do (with a separate `npm install` command) instead of just having a hard-coded older version in `package.json` so technically it's not a bug in one of the projects (just regular dependency hell :P). If it was in `package.json` npm would see that an older version of `@ethersproject/contracts` satisfies both `ethers@5.6.1` and `hardhat-deploy`. But when we downgrade ethers separately, npm keeps the newer version for hardhat-deploy and installs the older one separately for ethers. This behavior is not very intuitive. I'd expect it to either install a single version or fail.

Perpetual Pools test should be working now. It started failing tests for a different reason and finding a workaround turned out to be hard but in the end it noticed that the older `ethers@5.6.1` workaround is no longer needed and removing it fixes this failure too.

https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/pull/383 just got merged in Gnosis Safe and the newly added tests do not pass via IR: [1063183](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24194/workflows/b9445f24-d4ba-4377-818f-f7b1695b48f8/jobs/1063183). I'm updating `gnosis.sh` to disable that test.

More failures. Now Gnosis tests pass individually but start failing when you run them together: `npx hardhat test test/libraries/* test/migration/*`. I'll debug that tomorrow.
