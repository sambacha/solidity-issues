## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: Version: 0.8.14+commit.80d49f37.Windows.msvc
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Notepad++ 8.3.3. 64bit & https://github.com/Ekopalypse/NppLspClient V0.0.9 64 bits
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: default
- Operating system: Windows

## Steps to Reproduce

### setup
Install `solc-windows.exe` in `C:\tmp\solidity\`
Install `Notepad++`
Setup a language definition for Solidity in `Notepad++`  (for example via `https://github.com/alin1popa/solidity-notepadplusplus-userdefined-highlight`)
Download `https://github.com/Ekopalypse/NppLspClient/releases/download/v.0.0.9-alpha/NppLspClient_x64.zip`
Install `NppLspClient.dll` in `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins\NppLspClient`
Edit config file via menu `open configuration file` (`NppLspClientConfig.toml`) to contain:
```
[lspservers.solidity]
executable = 'C:\tmp\solidity\solc-windows.exe'
args = '--lsp'
mode = "io"
auto_start_server = true
```
Have some sample soldity files in  `C:\tmp\solidity\`
test.sol:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
import "test2.sol";

contract test() {
   uint x=1;
   uint y=x;
}   
```
test2.sol
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

### test in Notepad++
Open file `test.sol` in `Notepad++`
In menu option `Plugins/NppLspClient_x64` choose `Toggle Console` to see debug output.
Put the cursor on `import`
In menu option `Plugins/NppLspClient_x64` choose `Goto Definition`
Now nothing happens in the editor main screen.
The LSP output console shows: `{"id":4,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":[]}`
So somehow the lookup doesn't work.
The same happens with anything else I select.

Note: the detection of syntax errors does work and is shown in the editor, so the LSP interaction does work.

I will respond ASAP. Thanks for the reminder. :)

@christianparpart I can confirm that my `solc` (version `0.8.16+commit.07a7930e.Linux.g++`) has the same problem, definitions are always empty.
OS: Arch Linux
Editor: neovim with built-in lsp (config from https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)

The `solc` lsp is working properly otherwise, e.g. detecting syntax errors or faulty imports.

@gpersoon  Would you mind trying out this branch? Please tell me if you need a binary I should create for you (otherwise, just checkout the PRs branch and build).

@sebastianst while the above linked PR does fix it indeed for me, I am not sure it does for you. The reason why @gpersoon did have empty goto-def results is because URL decoding on his Windows platform is much more relevant (due to drive letters) than on Linux. Since you mentioned Linux in your version string, I wonder if it does fix it for you, too. Otherwise I'd like to get some I/O trace from you (can neovim's builtin lsp store one to disk? :thinking:).

@christianparpart thanks, the PR didn't fix the problem for me, so it seems to be a different issue. Here is a trace log when trying to go-to-definition when on an identifier defined in the same Solidity file:

@christianparpart could you create a binary? (i'm stuck on getting the
boost library to work)

@gpersoon You can get the binary [from the CI runs on that branch](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity?branch=fix-lsp-uri-decoding). For example here are the artifacts of the [most recent run of the CI job that produces a static Linux binary](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/27217/workflows/636763ba-91ec-4467-bc04-8d44d48432ff/jobs/1207680/artifacts).

Hi @cameel, thanks for the link to the CI. Is there a windows binary in there too? I can't find it. As the issue is windows specific it can't be tested with the linux binary.

Yeah: [`b_win` artifacts](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/27217/workflows/636763ba-91ec-4467-bc04-8d44d48432ff/jobs/1207688/artifacts).

I've tested the windows binary `0.8.18-ci.2022.11.4+commit.a2de5d4b.Windows.msvc` and the output is still the same. Not sure if this rpc call is supposed to give any output.
