# [\#13040 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13040) `merged`: Do not remove potentially reverting returndatacopy cases.

I'm wondering where and how we should also generally mark this in the semantics information...
Although libevmasm marks it as having side effects and it becomes non-movable and non-removable already...
We could consider the revert behaviour as "write to other state" instead, but that's a bit weird as well...
So maybe special handling in the ``UnusedStoreEliminator`` is just enough...

To fix this properly, I think returndatacopy should be marked the same way as `revert` (plus writing to memory) and we should override that in the unused store eliminator.

I need to check again, but I think it actually may be just like that... it's marked as "has side effects" in ``libevmasm/Instruction.cpp`` and neither revert nor returndatacopy are handled in any way specially beyond that in ``backends/evm/EVMDialect.cpp``... and just the ``UnusedStoreEliminator`` itself treats everything specifically on instruction basis, mostly ignoring side effects...
But yeah, let me double check...

But yeah, I guess the ``UnusedStoreEliminator`` could/should reject anything "non-removable" except for white-listed cases.

Looking through this again: the only way in which ``revert`` is marked differently is that it's marked as *always* reverting, which we obviously can't do for ``returndatacopy``... and *all* the instructions handled in the ``UnusedStoreEliminator`` are not movable/removable... so not sure there's much more to be done here, short of restructuring our side-effects in general (and not sure there's that much call for that based on this issue)...
