# [\#13045 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13045) `merged`: Bytes array to storage bug

Poor-man's-fix for the last cases in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11602

This costs, but it's significantly easier than trying to rewrite the copy routine in low-level-style to account for this...

@wechman The underlying situation is that we do not clear memory to zero after use, but rather only clear it on new allocations. That can result in the memory bytes *after* the data area of a ``bytes memory`` to contain "dirty", i.e. non-zero, values.

Now when copying ``bytes`` from memory to storage, we copied full 256-bit words in bulk. Consequently, the dirty bytes from memory could end up being copied to storage.

Unused storage, on the other hand, is generally assumed to be zero, so on ``.push`` on such a storage ``bytes`` only increases the length field, but does not explicitly write zero values. So such a ``.push`` on storage ``bytes`` could result in the new element of the ``bytes`` state variable to be *non-zero*, even though the docs are very clear on that it is supposed to be zero.

@wechman Yeah, the current ``copyArrayToStorage`` routine copies ``bytes`` just as if it was ``uint256[]`` - that kind of works, since the copy loop increments and checks slots/offsets during the loop and not element indices (at least that's how I remember it right now from looking at it last month). It would probably be possible to adjust the routine to do something similar as ``m_context.utilFunctions().copyByteArrayToStorageFunction``, i.e. first copy the bulk of the ``bytes`` array as 256-bit words and then copy the remaining single bytes separately... but I'm not sure it's worth the effort messing with the low-level routine for that...

Just rebased this. We should check the external test benchmarks - but judging from the ``isoltest`` gas reports, the difference in optimized legacy gas cost is not actually that bad - it's mainly some increases in code size and, of course, unoptimized code suffers a lot...

Just commented again on that - we definitely don't want the ``.push()`` to write a zero, so I'm merging as is :-).
