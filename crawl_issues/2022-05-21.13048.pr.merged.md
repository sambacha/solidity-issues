Moved the operator precedence section from the cheatsheet to types > operators.

Sorry, but I fear it does not work this way. You moved it to the integer type, but operator precedence is unrelated to the type.

#12934 
Point 4 here says it should be moved from the cheatsheet to Types > Operators, did I move it to the wrong place? Please correct me, I'm new.

It's not nested inside integer type docs. It's under "Operators", which is directly under "Types".

The failing CI job is unrelated to this PR and has a fix in `develop`. Please rebase.

Something weird happened here. I think you did a merge but there are your commits on both sides of it. Github shows tons of unrelated commits in your PR for that reason.

We don't merge `develop` into PRs to update them since that makes history very messy. We prefer a rebase workflow. I push a cleaned up version here in a moment.
