Hi!

First and foremost: thanks a lot for these amazing docs! They truly are outstandingly good!

However, there is something really small that's been bothering me a bit and I've decided to open a PR: IMO the "selector-like" signatures should be consistent and always use the canonical type representations.

I mean, IMHO I think that it's totally ok to display solidity code examples that uses the shorthand type definitions, ofc. However, I _think_ that when displaying "selector-like" function definitions, then the docs should stick with the canonical type representations.

I'm aware that this is a super small thing. So, I totally get it if you rather not to consider this change.

Need to wait for #13047 to make the test pass :(
