https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport uses `--via-ir`

The compile times are rather disappointing at ~10 minutes. Need to use it as a benchmark and tune performance of `solc`.

This is particularly about foundry. `forge build`.

This is not a problem on my side. With Hardhat it takes ~15 seconds with legacy pipeline and ~60 seconds with `--via-ir`.

@axic Was mainly about foundry. Updated the issue. Hardhat is fine on my end as well.

@hrkrshnn That sounds like something you'd get in a debug build. Is that on a M1 Mac or a Linux ARM system? If so, where is Foundry getting the binary from?

@cameel This is on x86 linux. Note that foundry can find dependencies and compile things in parallel. This was running on 16 threads on my machine. 

I think foundry uses https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs to fetch solidity.

```bash
cargo install svm-rs
svm install 0.8.13
objdump -h ~/.cargo/bin/solc | grep debug
```

gives me

I'm worried if the shipped binaries are debug builds now :(

Seems like `.cargo/bin/solc` is the wrapper for solc from https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs/tree/master/src/solc The debug symbols seems to be for the rust binary?

Seems so. I just ran `objdump -h` in a loop on all Linux binaries from solc-bin and there are no debug symbols in any of them.

That explains why it was so fast :P I more often get compilation times like 20-30 min on complex projects on debug builds. That's why I'm usually using release binaries rather than my local builds when working with ext tests.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
