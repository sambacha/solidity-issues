https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2849 and https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2709 are now fixed. We added workarounds in #13027 and #13020. Now we should be able to revert them.

There are still 3 gnosis test cases failing in CI in every preset [1071808](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24371/workflows/b68233fd-de80-4756-a47c-20a08ef21787/jobs/1071808). I was able to reproduce it locally, though I had to force hardhat version to 2.9.6 and apply the chainId workaround as discussed in [euler-xyz/euler-contracts#119](https://github.com/euler-xyz/euler-contracts/issues/119#issuecomment-1133367182). I guess it still has to do with the problem in [ethers-io/ethers.js#2849](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2849).

Does Uniswap pass? It failed for me when I tried removing the workaround in #13063.

Uniswap fails if workaround is removed.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
