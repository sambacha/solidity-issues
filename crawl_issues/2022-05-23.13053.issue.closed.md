## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/types.html#contract-types

## Abstract

The Contract Type section is stating: 

> If you declare a local variable of contract type (MyContract c), you can call functions on that contract. **Take care to assign it from somewhere that is the same contract type.**

The impression I got from reading this was that the compiler does not check if you assign a contract that is the same contract type. After checking in Remix, I realized the compiler verifies that the assigned value is of the same contract type, so why is this sentence necessary?

The paragraph just above is talking about conversions, including a conversion through `address` and this sentence essentially warns you about situations like this:
```solidity
ERC721 nft;
...
IERC20 token = IERC20(address(nft));
```
This could be valid if you know that your deployed `ERC721` also implements `IERC20` but the compiler cannot verify that and it could just as well be a mistake.

I agree that this sentence could be clearer. Feel free to submit a PR if you want to clarify this.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
