# [\#13063 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13063) `merged`: External test workarounds for Gnosis and Euler external test failures
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

A fresh batch of external test workarounds:

### Gnosis
Job [1072860](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24386/workflows/1d379105-8a89-41e6-88d3-442c5339827d/jobs/1072860) fails at `hardhat compile` step:
```
An unexpected error occurred:

Error: Debug Failure. False expression: Non-string value passed to `ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective`, likely by a wrapping package working with an outdated `resolveTypeReferenceDirectives` signature. This is probably not a problem in TS itself.
```

Some kind of incompatibility with latest [typescript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript?activeTab=versions). Typescript 4.7.2 was released today. Until now the project was using 4.6.4 (there were only pre-releases in 4.7.1 and 4.7.0 series). My workaround is to cap it at `< 4.7.0`.

### Euler
Job [1072861](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24386/workflows/1d379105-8a89-41e6-88d3-442c5339827d/jobs/1072861) has 3 failing tests with this error message:
```
337 passing (9m)
  3 failing

  1) batch operations
       sub-account transfers:
     Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'BatchDispatchSimulation(<error parameters>)'
        ...
```

This is somehow related to changes in ethers.js. We earlier capped ethers.js for this external test at 5.6.1 in #13027. Removing this older workaround now fixes the problem.

While at it I also removed this workaround from all other external tests except for Gnosis and Uniswap. In #13051 @matheusaaguiar determined that Gnosis is the case that still fails with 5.6.8 and for me Uniswap also fails here without the workaround (see [1073153](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24397/workflows/555dd7a6-bd3f-4164-b7ef-49646687da25/jobs/1073153)).
