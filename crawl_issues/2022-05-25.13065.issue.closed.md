Currently, when a semantic test fails, soltest/isoltest does not print any information about options it was executed with. In particular the EVM version used (`--evm-version` option) and the optimier status (`--optimize` option). This information should be included both in the console output for each failed test and in the XML file for CircleCI that it produces when `--logger=JUNIT` option is used.
