~Depends on #13063.~ Merged.

This is a bunch of CI tweaks addressing some of the [feeback we received in CircleCI's config review](https://gist.github.com/jenny-miggin/9578d2e52b383b3787e265c80e5f6b03). Here's an overview of what I'm changing:
1) I think that `b_win` job is superfluous given that we have `b_win_release` as well. They pretty much always fail or succeed together and for some reason `b_win` is actually sometimes not showing all compiler errors in its output and `b_win_release` does not have this problem. We're doing just fine with one job for macOS so I think we can do with one for Windows. macOS and Windows jobs are also the ones we're paying the most for so removing this is is going to be a big saving.
    - ~While at it I noticed that `b_osx` is actually running a release config, just like `b_win_release` so I also renamed it to `b_osx_release`.~ **EDIT 2022-10-24**: I misunderstood that. It was called `b_win_release` because it's built with `FORCE_RELEASE=ON`, not because it's a release build. All our macOS and Windows builds are release builds. So instead I'm now leaving it as is and renaming `b_ubu_release` to `b_ubu_force_release` to make this distinction clearer.
    - **2022-10-24**: I'm now removing `b_win_release` and leaving `b_win` in instead. We can't use `b_win_release` for bytecode comparison since it won't match version string of other, non-force-release binaries.
2) CircleCI has deprecated some of the images we're using (see [Legacy Convenience Image Deprecation](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/legacy-convenience-image-deprecation/41034)) so I'm switching to alternatives:
    - `cimg/node` instead `circleci/node`. The downside here is that the tags for major node.js versions like 12, 14, 16, etc. are no longer available and it doesn't looks like they'll come back anytime soon (https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-node/issues/130). ~For now I had to specify it down to patch version.~ And we'll have to remember about keeping them up to date now. **EDIT** It's actually possible to specify it only down to minor version which improves the situation a little.
    - `cimg/base` instead of `circleci/buildpack-deps`. In some cases we were using specifically `circleci/buildpack-deps:focal` and this tag is not available for `cimg/base` but this was for jobs like pylint or grammar so I don't think this matters.
        - This actually revealed a small problem with our bytecode report scripts. Looks like the new image has a different default locale, which affects the sort order for Bash globs and for Python's `sorted()`. This affects cases like `input_sol.sol` vs `in_sol.sol` and makes the comparison fail. To fix this I explicitly set locale to `C` whenever we use these scripts.

There are two more things that require more work and are not urgent so I only created issues for them:
- #13057
- #13056

Looks like I also need to set the locale on Windows somehow...

PR changes look fine and reflect what I can find in the description. In regard to the node version, can we maybe have a script that provides warning whenever a new release is available?

I rebased and made it worse :muscle:

This is now ready. All jobs pass except for the hardhat one, which is broken for unrelated reasons. Note that there are a few jobs that look like they're still running but that's because the were renamed/removed in the PR while they are still marked as required on github. Once the PR is approved, I'll adjust repo config to fix this, just before this is merged.

One important point to consider when reviewing this: are we fine with dropping one of the windows builds?

> I see bytecodecompare has different compiler versions, which I guess is the source of failure (one of, haven't checked in detail whether there's anything else).

It was failing because I removed one of the windows build jobs and switched the bytecode comparison it to use the other - which was running with `FORCE_RELEASE=ON`. That flag makes it identify as a release, which affects the version string - so version looked different than on other platforms. I fixed that by switching to removing the other windows job.

Can you explain in more detail why you dropped `b_win_release` (I saw the description about version difference, but still don't understand)? Also, what does `FORCE_RELEASE` do if the builds are already in release mode?

The primary motivation for dropping it was that it was one of the recommendations from [CircleCI's config review](https://gist.github.com/jenny-miggin/9578d2e52b383b3787e265c80e5f6b03):

> The `b_win` and `b_win_release` jobs are largely duplicated, only with an additional environment variable included in the latter. The same occurs for the `t_win` and `t_win_soltest` jobs. Consider optimising this further, by merging these jobs into a more efficient flow, and also perhaps including a [`when`](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043638052-Conditional-steps-in-jobs-and-conditional-workflows) clause to run only one workflow depending on whether the `FORCE_RELEASE:` environment variable is set or not, or by only running one of these on the `main` branch.

Windows and macOS jobs are pretty expensive and the difference between `b_win` and `b_win_release` is very small. At some point we considered moving one of them to the nightly run but really, but I'm not sure if such a build gives us all that much if it's not running on every PR.

I don't really remember any case where one of them failed and the other did not. At most, I noticed on multiple occasions that the build log from `b_win_release` is missing some error messages while they do show up in `b_win`. Not sure why it happens and we should just fix it but so far we never had much motivation to spend time on it.

> Also, what does `FORCE_RELEASE` do if the builds are already in release mode?

When we build a release we include an empty `prerelease.txt` file in repo root. Setting `FORCE_RELEASE=ON` does the same thing. Based on that our CMake config sets a different version string (it no longer says it's a development build) and the C++ code has access to that via a preprocessor macro. In this mode the compiler also no longer emits a warning that it's a pre-release version. There are probably some minor things it can affect in the build, but I'd have to look for them to tell. One you might be able to notice is if you break stripping of the pre-release warning and CI starts failing for only one of these builds. Other differences are unlikely to be very noticeable, it's just that it's too late to fix them when we're doing an actual release. We want to catch them earlier.

We still have a Linux build in this mode and it might be enough. For some reason we never had a macOS or emscripten build like this.
