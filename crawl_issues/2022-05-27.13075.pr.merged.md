I just merged #13072 so when you're done you can simply rebase on `develop`.

Ok.

Failed test run: [5b537588-6425-40b3-92e5-05a5414aff8a](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24435/workflows/5b537588-6425-40b3-92e5-05a5414aff8a).

Rebasing and removing errors now.

Looks like something's wrong. I can't see the `Run settings` output in any of the failed runs.

Changed the way the options information is added to test failure messages. Added it to the end of the `outputMessage` returned by the test and colored it yellow.I think it will show in CI now.

I figured out what happened. I only looked at isoltest and forgot about soltest. So the changes I made were only affecting the former. So here's what I did: I implemented method `toString()` and helper function `printOptions` in `CommonOptions`.  I think this is a good way to be able to access the options values in both testers, isoltest and soltest, or any other test that uses `CommonOptions`.

Now the options are showing in CI failed tests also: [076cf593-a2f5-4e95-9609-7aa537b52855](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/24466/workflows/076cf593-a2f5-4e95-9609-7aa537b52855)

Rebased on develop.
I am thinking that maybe in the future we could want to print other options. Is it worth to implement a way of specifying what option values are desired in the `printOptions` functions ? Maybe use std::initializer_list or a STL container like std::vector?
The thing that is bugging me is that now it is just hardcoded  to some options...

Maybe, but I'd avoid overgeneralizing it. Adding a new option would not have been a major effort even with the code you originally had here. But since you have already written it, we can just keep the general version now :)

A vector seems fine. If we wanted it to be really clean, I'd use an enum instead of strings for specifying options. But like I said, not much point extending it too much. What you have now is fine.

I'd keep only the version of `printOptions()` that takes the list of options and I'd hard-code the options we want at the point of call. After all the ones we want are specific to our use case (i.e. debugging a semantic test). If you want to avoid had-coding some options in two places maybe just create a constant for the default vector.
