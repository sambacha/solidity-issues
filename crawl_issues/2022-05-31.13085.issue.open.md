The code `string memory s = hex'c0a80101';` produces an error since `hex'c0a80101'` is not a valid UTF-8 sequence. The same value used in an array literal is accepted by compiler. For instance,  following code compiles without any errors or warnings: `string[2] memory data = [hex'74000001', hex'c0a80101'];`. It should be fixed so that, array literals are validated to contain UTF-8 sequences during conversion to the array of strings.

There's a couple of steps that currently is executed during type deduction and validation of an array literal.
First of all, if there is a need, each component of an array literal is validated. At this step Unicode literals are validated to be UTF-8 sequences. E.g. `[unicode'item1', unicode'\xc0a80101']` cause type error since `\xc0a80101` is not a valid UTF-8 sequence (this is covered by the SyntaxChecker). String and hexadecimal literals are not required to be valid UTF-8 sequences. For this reason, no compilation error is raised for `[hex'74000001', hex'c0a80101']`. 
The next step is to find a common type for mobile types of all the array literal elements (the TypeChecker handles that). 
`[hex'74000001', hex'c0a80101'];` is annotated as an array of byte arrays at this step. No UTF-8 validation is carried out at this step since the compiler does not know yet about variable that the literal is going to be assigned to.
Finally, there is a conversion from a just deduced common type to the `string[2] memory data`. At this step the compiler no longer deals with literal type so again, no UTF-8 validation is done.
I think the best way to address this issue it to postpone an array literal type deduction so the literal can be validated when it is being assigned to the variable. This is actually what we do in #12883.

This affects the ternary operator as well. No error here:
```solidity
string memory s = false ? hex'74000001' : hex'c0a80101';
```

This is because of mobile types that the [commonType](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/035f6abb1b1021689f746867a2a658734362e6b7/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L276)  function operates on. I think we can handle this within #13078 since the [commonType](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/035f6abb1b1021689f746867a2a658734362e6b7/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L276) function is no longer used for array literals.
