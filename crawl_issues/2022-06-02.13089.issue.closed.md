## Abstract

Utilize `codecopy` to optimize struct initialization, calldata generation, and other memory based steps

## Motivation

Struct initialization requires a memory word to be left as 0s, and when creating a new struct (or array), it is repeatedly copied to zero out memory (as the compiler may have written temporary data to it). Additionally, when performing a call to another smart contract with some constants, `pushN` opcodes are used to load the words on the stack followed by `mstore`. Both of these are relatively inefficient and each get more expensive the larger the struct/more static inputs to the call there are (the calldata optimization explicitly applies to static inputs).

Both of these can be improved at the cost of bytecode size.

## Specification

For struct initialization:
1. Keep a running maximum of word size for all structs instantiated in a contract
2. Assign a data section in a contract that would put 0 bytes equal to the size of the largest struct
3. Instead of `mload(zero_word) dup push(mem_loc) mstore, ... push(mem_loc) mstore`, for a given struct of a particular size, perform a `push(struct_size) push(zero_byte_codechunk) push(mem_loc) codecopy`

For calldata:
1. Analyze static inputs of calling a contract
2. Assign a data section in a contract that would hold the partially formed calldata, put 0 bytes in of dynamic input
3. Codecopy to the expected location in memory, mstore dynamic inputs
4. If there are dynamic length inputs at beginning/middle, delay the codecopy in the code until we know where to place the static data 

This kind of optimization likely applies to other things as well, like `keccak256`, `log`, etc.

## Backwards Compatibility

Should be compatible?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
