It was failing with messages like this:
> error: implicit conversion loses integer precision: 'typename std::enable_if<number_category<cpp_int_backend<0, 0, boost::multiprecision::signed_magnitude, boost::multiprecision::unchecked, allocator<unsigned long long>>>::value == number_kind_integer, std::size_t>::type' (aka 'unsigned long') to 'unsigned int'

Looking at your other issue I see it's FreeBSD + Clang 13. I compiled it locally with Clang 13.0.1 and Boost 1.78.0 and I don't get this warning. So it must be specific to FreeBSD and unfortunately neither CircleCI nor Github Actions have FreeBSD-based runners. So unfortunately we won't be able to detect these easily, we'll have to rely on bug reports.

We can still merge this PR though with the tweaks I suggested above.

My environment:
boost-libs-1.79.0
clang-13.0.0
FreeBSD 13.1
