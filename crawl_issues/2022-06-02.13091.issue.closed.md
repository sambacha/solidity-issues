# [\#13091 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13091) `closed`: #include <fstream> is missing in tools/solidityUpgrade/SourceUpgrade.cpp for std::ofstream
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

std::ofstream is used there but because there's no ```#include <fstream>``` clang-13 fails on FreeBSD 13.1

Thanks for the report. Would you be willing to submit a PR to fix this?

I wonder if it's generally reproducible with clang or specific to FreeBSD. We do get reports about these missing includes on some platforms from time to time. Would be best if we could catch more of them in our CI.

This issue probably depends on the c++ library in use.

In general I always include all headers that are needed in each module. You seem to rely on include statements in the other headers that you include.

Yeah. I mean, I thought that clang just comes with libc++ but I checked that now and looks like I have to install it separately and also tell clang to use it. So maybe we could actually add a libc++ build to CI.

I do that too, but not everyone does and we don't have a hard rule about that in the project so it's a bit of a mess. It's also hard to enforce automatically. We tried to add include-what-you-use as a CI check but that has too many false-positives.
