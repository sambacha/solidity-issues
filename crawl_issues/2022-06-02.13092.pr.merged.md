Disabling more zeppline tests that expect reverts with specific errors and they're broken via IR due to Hardhat heuristics.

I ran the test locally and everything passes now. I guess it just a matter of addressing cameel's suggestions and maybe adding a commentary for future reference about the workaround.

There was an error when running `chk_coding_style` for commit `75f3c5ec8993c0cb855d845d8c56e450ba03657a`:
```
Error: Trailing whitespace found:

Weird that `c_ext_benchmarks` is failing. It should be fine, only the OZ test can create `benchmark-zeppelin-ir-optimize-evm+yul.json`. Rerunning tests to see if it's reproducible.

@nishant-sachdeva I think know why `c_ext_benchmarks` is failing :P You committed an empty `benchmark-zeppelin-ir-optimize-evm+yul.json`. This file is not supposed to be in the repo.

Now `c_ext_benchmarks` is failing for a different reason: the previous run on `develop` failed so benchmarks are not available. This is unrelated to the PR here. I should have made it succeed in that case and just skip the diff. I'll do that in a separate PR.

Since benchmark job is optional, I'm going to merge this now despite the failure.
