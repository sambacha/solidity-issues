I see that github added something new.

I wanted to merge it but I took a look at `chk_pylint` details just in case and I noticed that it has one extra warning compared to what I fixed on `develop`. I think it actually comes from this PR:

```
test/lsp.py:646:4: R1710: Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should. (inconsistent-return-statements)
```
