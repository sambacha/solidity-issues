# [\#13102 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13102) `merged`: Better way to annotate unreachability in C++

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56763?u=373e0766d5c45bef8c7c7fc5ed48394935772065&v=4" width="50">[christianparpart](https://github.com/christianparpart) opened issue at [2022-06-07 13:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13102):

At first my code (after OS upgrade) wasn't compiling anymore so I fixed it an then realized @cameel was faster in fixing (or working around) what GCC 12 is reporting.

I think however, that the above suggested way is probably the better way, generally, and also for future-use. What do you think @cameel ?

PR relates to #13087.
