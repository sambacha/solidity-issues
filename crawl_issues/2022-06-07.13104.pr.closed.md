For the multiplication case of 256bit, I could not come up with something better than checking if `x == product / y` (with y != 0). I think it is safe to assume that in case of an overflow/underflow, the truncated result should not "cycle" back to `x`...

Let's finish the addition part first and get it merged. Then work on multiplication in a new PR.

Ok,  #13130  is a separate PR with only add/sub checks.
