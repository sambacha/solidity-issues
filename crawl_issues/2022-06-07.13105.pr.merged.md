# What does this PR introduce?

Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, it was possible to **convert explicitly** any integer type (signed or unsigned) to the `address` type.

For instance, these Solidity code snippets would have compiled up to version 0.7.6:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.7.6;

contract Address {

    function convertAddress(uint256 a) public pure returns (address) {
        return address(a);
    }

    function convertAddress(uint48 a) public pure returns (address) {
        return address(a);
    }

    function convertAddress(int8 a) public pure returns (address) {
        return address(a);
    }
    
}
```

## Docs changed introduced

This PR aims to clarify the change of behaviour in the Section **Types > Conversion > Address**, specifying that:

- explicit conversion from `uint160` is allowed.
- add a notice about the behaviour of explicit `address` conversion prior to 0.8.0.

Your commit messages should detail why you made your change in addition to what you did (unless it is a tiny change).

@cameel
I have addressed your comments and removed this last part from the sentence (about _"result in `address payable`")_

I have suggested to mention it in the next sentence then, to be more specific. See this commit: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/5f2be0c8b776d9eff750fd6bcb023a7e949e6c10

Let me know if that's ok, otherwise I will remove it.

Looks good. Can you squash your commits so that we can merge this?

@cameel I have squashed my commits as requested :)

@cameel some tests in the CI are failing. I am not sure to understand why.

Is it actually rebased on top of `develop`?

BTW, I'm off currently but maybe someone else from the team could help with the rebase here? @matheusaaguiar?

Yes, it needs a rebase.
@CJ42 , you can do it with the following commands:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git  #add solidity remote repo
git fetch upstream                                                #update from solidity remote repo
git rebase upstream/develop                                #rebase on top of current develop
git push origin develop -f                                      #force update on your fork repo 
```
Let me know if you need any help.

[This](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) should help too if you are more used to the web UI.

@matheusaaguiar had a bit of hard time doing the rebase, but managed in the end.
Thought it would be hopefully good, but still the CI for tests is failing.

I am not sure to understand why, since this PR only include docs changes.

@CJ42 Nice! Don't worry about these failing tests, they are broken due to reasons unrelated to your PR.

@matheusaaguiar @cameel is there anything else to do on my side so that this can be merged?

Sorry about the delay, @CJ42 . I rebased your PR and it should be merged once all tests are green.
