# [\#13108 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13108) `closed`: Optimizer should be able to efficiently use the `byte(i, v)` opcode
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

This function should only return true when `v == 27 || v == 28`:
```solidity
contract C {
  function f(uint256 v) pure external returns (bool) {
      return bytes32(uint256(0x0101000000))[v] != 0;
  }
}
```

This is the pure Solidity version of the assembly in https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/pull/406:
```solidity
vIsValid := byte(v, 0x0101000000)
```

The ideal bytecode is the above. The bytecode we generate (with the optimizer on) is the following:
```
    tag_7:
        /* "byte.sol":55:59  bool */
      0x00
        /* "byte.sol":92:104  0x0101000000 */
      0x0101000000
        /* "byte.sol":107:108  v */
      dup3
        /* "byte.sol":76:109  bytes32(uint256(0x0101000000))[v] */
      0x20
      dup2
      lt
      tag_12
      jumpi
      tag_12
      tag_13
      jump	// in
    tag_12:
      byte
      0xf8
      shl
      not(sub(shl(0xf8, 0x01), 0x01))
        /* "byte.sol":76:114  bytes32(uint256(0x0101000000))[v] != 0 */
      and
      iszero
      iszero
      swap3
      swap2
      pop
      pop
        /* "byte.sol":15:119  function f(uint256 v) external returns (bool) {... */
      jump	// out
```

It has unnecessary cleanup.

Hm... this is a bit tricky actually... in the optimized Yul code I'm seeing:
```
	and(
		shl(248, byte(value, 0x0101000000)),
		shl(248, 255)
	)
```
In this case it would be good to move the ``and`` into the shifts to get
```
		shl(248, and(byte(value, 0x0101000000), 255))
```
After which we have another rule that would eliminate the ``and``, yielding just ``shl(248, byte(value, 0x0101000000))``.

That's not all we can do, but it'd be progress - but unfortunately, we also have the opposite rule that transforms:
```
shl(B, and(X, A)) -> and(shl(B, X), A << B)
```
I guess the idea for that rule is to be able to combine more easily with other ``and``s...

After #13529 this still looks the same:
```
    tag_7:
        /* "13018.sol":60:64  bool */
      0x00
        /* "13018.sol":97:109  0x0101000000 */
      0x0101000000
        /* "13018.sol":112:113  v */
      dup3
        /* "13018.sol":81:114  bytes32(uint256(0x0101000000))[v] */
      0x20
      dup2
      lt
      tag_12
      jumpi
      tag_12
      tag_13
      jump	// in
    tag_12:
      byte
      0xf8
      shl
      not(sub(shl(0xf8, 0x01), 0x01))
        /* "13018.sol":81:119  bytes32(uint256(0x0101000000))[v] != 0 */
      and
      iszero
      iszero
      swap3
      swap2
      pop
      pop
        /* "13018.sol":15:124  function f(uint256 v) pure external returns (bool) {... */
      jump	// out
```

So I guess the rule is not picked up.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
