Example is incorrect in the sense that "Free functions" cannot have visibility specified.

Thanks for the correction. It's weird that it actually passed our tests - we do test all these snippets. Turns out that our tests expect the snippet to fail if it has any imports - these won't work in the docs. This snippet triggered that condition because it has an import inside a comment. So we were expecting it to fail and it was indeed failing - but not due to the import :) Now that you fixed it our tests actually started failing because the snippet is no longer producing an error.

I adjusted our regexes to skip commented-out imports and pushed that as an extra commit to your branch. This should make CI pass.
