# [\#13116 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13116) `closed`: [Sol -> Yul] Implement copying of arrays of external function pointers from calldata to storage.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2022-06-09 12:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13116):

It's rather obscure, but the following is still missing from Sol -> Yul codegen:
```
contract C {
        function() external[] x;
        function f(function() external[] calldata y) public {
                x = y;
        }
}
```
is not handled by ``YulUtilFunctions::copyArrayToStorageFunction``, so above contract won't compile with ``--bin --via-ir`` (while legacy codegen has it properly implemented).
