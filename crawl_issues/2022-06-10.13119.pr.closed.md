fixes #13078 

Type deduction for ternary operator starts with a check if an implicit conversion between one operand type into a mobile type of the other one is possible. That allows to use all the information of the operand types (e.g. literal types) before it is lost in result of conversion to the mobile type.

I don't think we should complicate type conversion rules. It is much more confusing if there are more special cases than simple rules that require you to do a bit more typing.

If we want, we could improve the suggestion how to fix the error.

Actually the only thing we need to do is to drop premature conversion to the mobile type. I updated draft with that. Let me know if it looks better now.

This hasn't changed in more than a month. Is @wechman working on it or is it a `takeover` PR?

@leonardoalt Actually, there is no much to do. The PR is ready to be reviewed.

We're ok with the current behavior, so we're closing it.

Well, I'm not ok with the current behavior. Still, this is very low priority and needs some careful review to make sure it does not break anything so better close it because I'm not sure if we'll manage to get back to this any time soon.
