# What does this PR introduce?

A very simple mention in the **inline-assembly** section in the docs about the new `("memory-safe")` feature.
Since it was introduced recently, I thought it would be good to mention it is available since 0.8.13, as devs using older compiler version like 0.8.7 might not guess it from the docs.

Not sure if it's in your conventions tho to mention the versions number directly in the docs content body.

Hello, @CJ42 are you still working on the PR? What do you think about the changes I requested above?

@cameel went back to the PR.
I have changed the mention to be at the end, where you mention about natspec comments and that _"annotation via comment will be disallowed in a future breaking release"_.

I still think it should be mentioned in a bit more obvious manner that this is a recently new feature (maybe via a link to changelog? a callout?)

If you are new and want to use the memory safe feature in assembly using an older/more stable version of the compiler like 0.8.7 for instance, the error message from the Solidity compiler does not help to know that.

_example:_

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity 0.8.7;

contract Draft {
    
    function test() public {

        assembly ("memory-safe") {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

A little hint in the docs would help. How about mentioning it in a blue callout under the sub-heading **Memory Safety[ÔÉÅ](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/assembly.html#memory-safety)**?

Thanks for adding more context. This explains why you want it there but, honestly, I'm still not convinced that this particular case requires special treatment. We introduce new features all the time and using them with older versions will often produce similarly unfriendly errors. If it's really an issue, we should address it more comprehensively. For example, I would not be against having the version listed explicitly for each major feature. You could submit a feature request for that and we could discuss it further. For now we're not doing it though so it would be a bit out of place. I think that having the version mentioned where it's relevant (i.e. in the paragraph about the comment) is more in line with the rest of the docs

By the way, I just pushed some small tweaks to the text. Please see if maybe this version would be better? We could also make it a note, but I think it makes more sense as part of the main text.

Ok @cameel  I understand the context of new features better and not mention the version they were introduced everywhere.

I think the change and way it's described in the paragraph now look good to me.

I am new to the Solidity language but fairly new to contributing Open Source to the Solidity repository (and very keen to do so!)

What is the best place to start? Do you have some areas (docs/features) that need particular attention? If yes where can I find more info? üôÇ

ok then. In that case I'm going to squash commits here and merge it. Thanks for the PR!

We have some issues labeled with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A"good+first+issue"). These are always good starting points and you'll find easier and harder ones, both actual C++ code and docs. Note that many already have pending PRs (these should be visible in the issue though).

Though honestly, our problem right now is that we don't yet have enough manpower to review all PRs efficiently so they're piling up, especially in areas that are not a high priority - as you have probably seen by how long this PR has been waiting :) If you'd like something that would get more attention, perhaps #12783 would be a good one to try. This one might require some guidance though.
