# [\#13135 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13135) `merged`: Revert access to foreign events and clean up event/error selector tests/docs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-06-14 10:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13135):

Related to #13086.

This reverts the part of #12921 that enabled full access to events defined in foreign contracts and interfaces.

I also cleaned up some mess I noticed in tests and docs while doing the revert.
