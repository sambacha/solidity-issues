## Description
Function selectors can be used to initialize constants while error and event selectors (recently introduced in #12921) are rejected as non-constant. I think that all of them should work the same way in that regard.

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C {
    event Ev();
    error Er();
    function f() external {}

    bytes4 constant functionSelector = this.f.selector;  // OK
    bytes4 constant errorSelector = Er.selector;         // Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
    bytes32 constant eventSelector = Ev.selector;        // Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
}
```
```
Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
 --> test.sol:7:37:
  |
7 |     bytes4 constant errorSelector = Er.selector;         // Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
  |                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^

Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
 --> test.sol:8:38:
  |
8 |     bytes32 constant eventSelector = Ev.selector;        // Error: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
  |                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^            
```

The test passes without errors if you remove `constant` from the state variables.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.15 (`develop`)

Can you leave a source below to learn about this ?

@jackson1129 The best way to start with this issue would be to take a look at the AST produced for these expressionts. Take this snippet:
```solidity
contract C {
    event Ev();
    error Er();
    function f() external {}

    function test() public {
        this.f.selector;
        Er.selector;
        Ev.selector;
    }
}
```

Now look at the AST output (`solc test.sol --ast-compact-json --pretty-json --json-indent 4`). This shows you how the compiler takes apart each of these expressions. The annotation to look for is `isPure`. 

Here's the relevant bit for `this.f.selector`:
```json
"id": 15,
"isConstant": false,
"isLValue": false,
"isPure": true,
"lValueRequested": false,
"memberLocation": "119:8:0",
"memberName": "selector",
"nodeType": "MemberAccess",
```
here's `Er.selector`:
```json
"id": 19,
"isConstant": false,
"isLValue": false,
"isPure": false,
"lValueRequested": false,
"memberLocation": "140:8:0",
"memberName": "selector",
"nodeType": "MemberAccess",
```
and `Ev.selector`
```json
"id": 23,
"isConstant": false,
"isLValue": false,
"isPure": false,
"lValueRequested": false,
"memberLocation": "161:8:0",
"memberName": "selector",
"nodeType": "MemberAccess",
```

Note that the function get correctly marked with `isPure: true`, while the error and the event do not.

The code that sets `isPure` for the `selector` member is here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/591df042115c6df190faa26a1fb87617f7772db3/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L3245-L3260

The issue is probably that it requires a function definition and events and errors do not have one (not 100% sure though, since they do have function types and do have declarations). You need to adjust the code so that error and event selectors get the right annotation too. While doing it please include tests to make sure things that should not get this annotation do not get it by mistake.

In the given Solidity contract, the functionSelector assignment is valid because it uses the selector property of a function which is a compile-time constant. However, the errorSelector and eventSelector assignments are not valid because they use the selector property of an error and an event respectively, which are not compile-time constants.

In Solidity, a constant variable must be initialized with a value that can be evaluated at compile-time. The selector property of an error or event is not known until runtime, so it cannot be used to initialize a constant variable.

To fix the errors, we could either remove the constant keyword from the variable declarations or initialize them with a compile-time constant value. For example, we could define a separate function to return the selector values at runtime, and use that function to initialize the constants:


contract C {
    event Ev();
    error Er();
    function f() external {}

    function getErrorSelector() public pure returns (bytes4) {
        return Er.selector;
    }

    function getEventSelector() public pure returns (bytes4) {
        return Ev.selector;
    }

    bytes4 constant functionSelector = this.f.selector;
    bytes4 constant errorSelector = getErrorSelector();
    bytes4 constant eventSelector = getEventSelector();
}
This way, the errorSelector and eventSelector constants are initialized with the return values of the getErrorSelector and getEventSelector functions, which can be evaluated at runtime.

Hello Ethereum/Solidity how are you doing
