After the merge of [openzeppelin-contracts#3467](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3467) file `ERC20TokenizedVault.test.js` was renamed to `ERC4626.test.js`. There are two `sed` commands in the `zeppelin.sh` script which referenced that file and needed to be changed accordingly.

Looks like it passed - enabling auto-merge.
