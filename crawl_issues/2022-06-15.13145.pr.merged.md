Interesting. The changes are pretty much the same as in #13090. So it apparently wasn't just a BSD problem after all. The PR said it's because of Boost 1.77 but I dismissed it because I was already running 1.78 and it wasn't happening for me. Now I see that Boost 1.79 just hit Arch repos and, looking closer at the comment from the contributor, he later said he's actually using 1.79.

My local builds just passed, so I hope this now was all of them.

Yeah... I was actually hoping that the next boost release played nicer with gcc 12, but apparently they still only support gcc 11 and it actually made things worse :-).
Might also be the reason for the arch update taking longer than usual for it.
