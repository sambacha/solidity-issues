https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13139 attempted to add some warnings about easy-to-miss dangling reference cases.

We could go beyond that and also warn about cases like this:
```
contract C {
   uint[] x;
   uint[] y;
   function g() internal returns (uint[] storage) {
      x.pop();
      return y;
   }
   function f() public {
      (x[x.length - 1], g()[1]) = (1, 2);
   }
}
```
(which, roughly, we got reported as a bug bounty report)

In general we could warn about using most kinds of complex expressions on left-hand-sides of tuple assignments, especially about function calls.

We should also check if we can construct problematic cases in non-tuple assignments.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Reopening this as breaking change for completely disallowing these weird cases.
