## Description

Sometimes custom errors are not included in the smart contract ABI based on their direct usage in Solidity code.

This case works fine:
```solidity
contract A {
    error Foo();

    function f() external {
        revert Foo();
    }
}
```

This case works fine too:
```solidity
contract A {
    error Foo();

    function f() external {
        bytes4 exception = Foo.selector;
        assembly {
            mstore(0, exception)
            revert(0, 4)
        }
    }
}
```

But using the same approach in the library does not work properly:
```solidity
library L {
    error Foo();

    function g() internal {
        bytes4 exception = Foo.selector;
        assembly {
            mstore(0, exception)
            revert(0, 4)
        }
    }
}

contract A {
    function f() external {
        L.g();
    }
}
```

`Foo` error is not included in the smart contract ABI, which I believe is a mistake. What about unconditionally including all libraries' custom errors in ABI?

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.14

This is actually by design - which does not mean we can't change it - but the idea was that the ABI should contain only the events that are actually emitted and errors that are actually used - in addition to all events and errors defined within the contract. For example if you just do `L.Foo;`, i.e. refer to an error (or an event) without actually doing a revert, it won't appear in the ABI either.

So I guess we could treat it as a feature request. I can see how it can be useful in your example but it could also be misleading. E.g. you could refer to the selector but use a completely different value in the revert.

@chriseth Do you think this would be a good change?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I am seeing the same issue with errors defined outside the contract and used within the contract, but within assembly block, both with `CustomError.selector` or the raw selector:

```solidity

error Foo();

contract A {
    function f() external {
        bytes4 exception = Foo.selector;
        assembly {
            mstore(0, exception)
            revert(0, 4)
        }
    }

    function f() external {
        assembly {
            mstore(0, 0xbfb4ebcf) // Foo()
            revert(0, 4)
        }
    }
}
```

And declaring the errors within the contract seem to have increased gas usage than having them outside in some cases

The compiler can't magically guess the intention of inline assembly - if you want the compiler to output the use of an error, you need to emit it by the high-level mechanisms the compiler provides for that, i.e. by a ``revert Foo();``.

@ekpyron but compiler could detect error selector access:
```
bytes4 exception = Foo.selector;
```

That's a false positive, though - there is no telling what happens with the selector.
The interesting question is: why are you emitting these errors in inline assembly in the first place?

Emitting these errors from inline assembly seem to clock lesser deployment gas than otherwise. 
Bytecode does seem to change, although its size seem to remain the same

Yeah, I'd recommend against micro-optimizing revert cases. Optimized via-IR compilation should be closer to the assembly version - optimized via-IR compilation with a high ``--optimize-runs`` value I'd expect to yield identical cost.

Ah, sorry, you said deployment gas cost - there is actually indeed an easy optimization we can do for these cases, I'll take a quick look at that. In general, we'd prefer to fix the reason for people resorting to inline assembly and I think we can improve the situation here.

Sometimes error needs to happen in the middle of assembly block, itâ€™s not related to micro optimizations.

@ekpyron regarding reasoning for stepping back to assembly I have latest example: safeBalanceOf written in assembly cost 200 gas less than external call in solidity: https://github.com/1inch/solidity-utils/blob/b51b9348f703f7612fda7573d3cb476bccb34383/contracts/libraries/SafeERC20.sol#L26-L43 (PR https://github.com/1inch/solidity-utils/pull/83)

Same for `ecrecover`, somehow using assembly saves hundreds of gas: https://github.com/1inch/solidity-utils/blob/b51b9348f703f7612fda7573d3cb476bccb34383/contracts/libraries/ECDSA.sol#L21-L40

Yeah, there's multiple things we can do for those cases as well (returning to scratch space for small static return data sizes and some fusing of conditions in the optimizer), but I won't get around to do anything about them in time for tomorrow's planned release - but I'm making a note of those cases and more optimizations we can do in them.
