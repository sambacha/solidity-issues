<!--## Prerequisites

- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.13
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Truffle No okay, Remix Okay
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Mac OSX

## Steps to Reproduce
Stack too deep error when trying to compile a function in Truffle in VS Code. 
But worked okay on Remix. 
 Some responses online were that there's a limit to the number of variables declared in a function. 
So I had to declare another struct with all the variables needed within the function so that they didn't need to be initiated in the function. This was the only way to get around the error message in Truffle/ VS Code. 

Is this a bug, or would it be possible to increase the capacity of a Solidity function to hold more variables. 
Or access variables via deep mappings like struct var -> map->array.

The easiest solution to most "stack too deep" errors these days is to switch to via-IR code generation and enable the optimizer.

Apart from saying that generally, there is little I can do to help without a full reproduction :-).

Thanks for your response @ekpyron. I went ahead and replicated the error message and have included links to the  .sol file, the config file , dependencies and the error message. 
 
Accordingly I've created gists to show the .sol file and my config file as follows:

1. Config Gist:  https://gist.github.com/cryptonomicon46/77474e794b9ff0fd1d33568a6a1f4db0
2. .SOL gist:  https://gist.github.com/cryptonomicon46/f74ad1a592d322450fb5946246b91e07#file-stacktoodeep

IDE: VS Code using Truffle to compile. Error message and dependencies are included in the comments under the gist.

Yeah, you have a lot of local variables in ``revealWinner``, which apparently is too much for the legacy code generation path to handle - this is a known issue 
If you add ``"viaIR": true,`` to the compiler settings in your config, i.e. switch to the new optimized via-IR code generation pipeline, the issue should vanish.

So does my last comment solve your problem :-)? If so, we can close the issue.

I'm assuming the issue is solved by that (i.e. "won't fix" in legacy code generation and fixed by via-IR plus optimizer). Feel free to re-open, if you disagree, though.
