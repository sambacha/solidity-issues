## Description

I frequently get errors like the following:

```

```

This only happens occasionally (I'll include a testcase below), and it's always hard to fix. The only solution is to set `{gasLimit: 3e7}` in each contract function call.

One thing that can trigger this problem is when the contract size approaches the maximum possible size. (Hopefully the testcase triggers this as a standalone program -- other contracts in my build environment raise the total size close to the limit.)

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.14
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): unknown
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Hardhat network
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

`Contracts.sol`:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.14;

contract HasReceiveFunction {
    uint256 public receivedETH;
    receive() external payable {
        receivedETH += msg.value;
    }
}

contract SendFunction {
    function send(address to) external payable {
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert("Failed to send ETH");
        }
    }
}
```

`index.js`:

```
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const SendFunction = require("../artifacts/contracts/Contracts.sol/SendFunction.json");
const HasReceiveFunction = require("../artifacts/contracts/Contracts.sol/HasReceiveFunction.json");

async function deployContract(wallet, contract, constructorArgs) {
    const contractInstance = await ethers.ContractFactory.fromSolidity(contract, wallet).deploy(...constructorArgs);
    await contractInstance.deployed();
    return contractInstance;
}

describe("TestSendReceiveFunction", () => {
  let wallet;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    wallet = await ethers.getSigners();
  });

  it("send ETH", async () => {
    const send = await deployContract(wallet[2], SendFunction, []);
    const hasReceive = await deployContract(wallet[1], HasReceiveFunction, []);
    await send.send(hasReceive.address, {value: 101, gasLimit: 3e7});
    expect(await hasReceive.receivedETH({gasLimit:3e7})).to.equal(101);
  });
)};
```

To trigger the error, you need to do two things:

1. Remove the `gasLimit: 3e7` args.
2. Change `(bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}("");` into `(bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}("x");` -- this should revert the `call`, because `receive` functions require that `msg.data.length == 0`. It's when this call tries to revert that the "cannot estimate gas" error seems to be triggered.

I checked the Solidity documentation, and sometimes this is triggered simply by a transaction reverting. I don't know why some transactions reverting trigger this and some don't.

Add `allowUnlimitedContractSize: true` to your hardhat.config.ts under defaultNetworks.networks both "hardhat" and "localhost".
At least it worked for me.

Have you fixed it yet? Having the same issue using ether js and walletconnect provider. But works with injected

Am doing: `signer.estimateGas.method(parameter)` 

Edit: My bad, it was my mistake on contract. I was facing the issue for doing unhandled rejections.
The reason was the transaction actually reverting every time for lack of allowance which I didn't handled in contract. Thus, the estimateGas method was reverting every time as the contract call fails.

From my side the solution would be for this by debugging the contract if somehow it reverts the call by any unhandled rejection

in my case, there is a line of code in the constructor that revert the transaction 
` require(block.timestamp < _poolStartTime, "late");`

Check your code for any revert boyz

Hi 
I got this error in my code.
I just forgot to add    "utf8"  in fs.readFileSync()
```javascript
const binary = fs.readFileSync(
    "./SimpleStorage_sol_SimpleStorage.bin",
    "utf8"

```
and this fixes my error.

And I mean that maybe your code (@lukehutch) has some bugs like that.

Same problem.

I solved it in this way.

1. Create a new directory totally empty: /blabla/createsmartaccount_dir.

2. Create these 2 files inside it.  

/blabla/createsmartaccount_dir/index.js

/blabla/createsmartaccount_dir/package.json


3. Run the commands

npm install

node ./index.js






```
#/blabla/createsmartaccount_dir/index.js

const { ethers } = require( 'ethers')
const { EthersAdapter } = require(  '@safe-global/protocol-kit')
const Safe = require(  '@safe-global/protocol-kit')
const { SafeFactory } = require(  '@safe-global/protocol-kit')
const { SafeAccountConfig } = require(  '@safe-global/protocol-kit')
const { ContractNetworksConfig } = require(  '@safe-global/protocol-kit')

const execute = async () => {
    const RPC_URL='https://rpc2.sepolia.org'
    const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL)
    
    
    
    // Initialize signers
    //metamask wallet and privatekey
    //0x967c1CF5d91f3738c969c76EB4bDddA6da4183c1
    const signerWallet = 
new ethers.Wallet("ca46xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx", provider)

    const ethAdapter = new EthersAdapter({ethers, signerOrProvider: signerWallet})
    
    const chainId = await ethAdapter.getChainId()
    console.log(`ChainId: ${chainId}`)

    
  
    
    const safeVersion = '1.3.0'
    const isL1SafeMasterCopy = false
    const safeFactory = await SafeFactory.create({ ethAdapter: ethAdapter })



    const safeAccountConfig = {
        threshold: 1, // Have to be >= 1 && <= totalOwners
        owners: ["0x967xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"],
        eth_estimateGas:30000,
    }
    console.log("Start Deploying Safe");



    
    
	//This Safe is tied to owner 1 because the factory was initialized with an 
	//adapter that had owner 1 as the signer. 
  
    const safeSdkOwner1 = await safeFactory.deploySafe({ safeAccountConfig })

    const safeAddress = safeSdkOwner1.getAddress()

    console.log(`Safe deployed at: ${safeAddress}`)  
}
execute();

```

My solve was to upgrade everything I could in my project relating to hardhat and ganache.
```
yarn add ganache
yarn add hardhat
yarn add hardhat-contract-sizer
yarn add hardhat-gas-reporter
yarn add solidity-coverage
yarn add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers
```

Out of nowhere some conflict between my packages was causing my configuration to no longer function as it used to.

```
hardhat: {
  throwOnTransactionFailures: true,
  throwOnCallFailures: true,
  allowUnlimitedContractSize: true,
  timeout: 1800000
},
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

Have you tried specifically **setting a higher gas limit**?

```
        // if you are using ethers.js
        ....
        const contractFactory = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, binary, wallet);
	const overrides = {
		gasPrice: 10000000000, // Can set this >= to the number read from Ganache window
		gasLimit: 6721975, // Use the same gasLimit as read from Ganache window (or a bit higher if still having issue)
	};
	const contract = await contractFactory.deploy(overrides);
```

Let me know if that helps!

There are some things you can do to deal with We were not able to estimate gas. there might be an error in the contract and this transaction may fail issue.

we were not able to estimate gas. there might be an error in the contract and this transaction may fail.

1- Contract review: Review the smart contract code to make sure there are no errors or issues that could cause gas estimation problems. Look for any complicated operations or loops that cause excessive gas consumption.

Also, check the account you use is the same account you set up the contract with because you have a restricted converter and you start the manager in the manufacturer.

There are a couple of approaches to troubleshoot your contract like attempt adding a candidate through Etherscan. If the issue persists, consider deploying the contract on another testnet or estimate the gas required for this function.

2- Gas Limit: Make sure you set the proper gas limit for the transaction. If the gas limit is too low, the transaction may fail due to running out of gas before completion.

3- Gas Price: Make sure the gas price you are willing to pay is appropriate for the current network conditions. If gas prices are too low, miners may prioritize other projects over yours.

4- Consult with Developers: If you’re not the developer of the contract, consider consulting with the team or individual who developed it for assistance in resolving the problem of why [We were not able to estimate gas. there might be an error in the contract and this transaction may fail](https://fundlan.com/cannot-estimate-gas-metamask/).

Change `(bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}("");` into `(bool success,) = to.call{value: msg.value}("x");` -- this should revert the `call`, because `receive` functions require that `msg.data.length == 0`. It's when this call tries to revert that the "cannot estimate gas" error seems to be triggered.

This is the exact error I'm having

I've got same error.
How to fix it?
Error is like this.
"Error: Error: cannot estimate gas; transaction may fail or may require manual gas limit [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT ] (reason="execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance", method="estimateGas", transaction={"from":"0x0f252d465D12c03E42C206a21cE4A9Fe4E81e75F","to":"0x6350038196Bd8cDC12aEFd990c34DCb5E9876cba","data":"0x79c888940000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002","accessList":null}, error={"code":-32603,"message":"Internal JSON-RPC error.","data":{"code":3,"message":"execution reverted: ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance""
