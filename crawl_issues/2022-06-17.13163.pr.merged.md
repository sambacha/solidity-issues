Looks good. The end result is certainly more readable, though as @cameel [mentioned](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9601#issuecomment-739534814) getting rid of the `0x80` part would be best. Doesn't have to happen in this PR though, this is still better than what we had before.

I modified the comments according to your advice. I'll get rid of the 0x80 part in another PR.

Also please ignore my "dismissed a stale review" and my temporary closing of this PR. This is my first PR, so i am not fully familiar with the interface

@Marenz  Shall I resend this pull request? This one has become cluttered with the updating coding style commits

No no, just amend (as in, merge into one) the commits and force push, then it's all clean again

@Marenz  t_native_text_ext_chainlink fails, but I only changed the comments here. Should I try and fix it?

I don't think it was your change. It's not marked as "required" as well, so you can just ignore it for now

We still have three commits that should be merged into one though :)-
