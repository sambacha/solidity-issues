# [\#13166 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13166) `merged`: Fix for library name updates in isoltest semantics tests.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2022-06-17 14:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13166):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13120.

However, this is again only a minimal hot fix for the issue.
What should really be done is to give those different kinds of function calls a proper structure instead of adding more most of the time unused fields and reusing fields with different meaning - e.g. it could be a variant.
And generally, the entire infrastructure here could probably be largely simplified.
Anyways, this adjustment here should fix the issue at hand.
