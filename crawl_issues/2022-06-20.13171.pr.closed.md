This PR adds a "Legacy Dockerfile" in `scripts/Dockerfile_legacy`. This Dockerfile is an attempt to reproduce legacy solidity environments to examine ancient versions of solidity. The Dockerfile can be used to build a container that includes a `solc` executable with:

`docker build -f ./scripts/Dockerfile_legacy -t solidity-legacy .`

the container can then be used to invoke the `solc` executable:

```
docker run solidity-legac --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.1.0-cd6e4fd4/Release-Linux/g++/int
```

This PR also includes a bash shim that can be moved into `$PATH` to act as a proxy to the Docker container.

Creation of this Dockerfile and reproduction of the legacy environment was part of a research exercise to audit some deployed legacy contracts. The audit was looking specifically at a contract compiled with `v0.1.2` of solidity. Its not clear that this Dockerfile 100% accurately reproduces the `v0.1.2` build but comparing some deployed bytecode with output from this executable did produce a match.

I'm sharing this work in hopes it will be useful to others and maybe prompt further collaboration Its not clear what the source of truth is for the legacy source code. It appears that code was manually duplicate copied between multiple repositories at the time like: 
* https://github.com/ethereumproject/cpp-ethereum 
* https://github.com/ethereum/aleth 
* https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum-cmake 
and
* https://github.com/ethereum/solidity 

This docker file attempts to build from the `ethereum/solidity` repo but I think it is actually building from `cpp-ethereum` they seem circular dependant. Hopefully this will be helpful for anyone else doing research.

Thanks for the PR and sorry for the delay in reviewing it.
I think this is pretty cool! We need to decide whether we want to host it in the repo and review it.
Any team member, feel free to review.

Hm... this is indeed nice in principle, but we should probably not take up too much maintenance burden here - we have precedent for similar legacy-scripts in the repo in ``scripts/wasm-rebuild``... maybe we should move all stuff like this into a ``scripts/legacy`` subfolder with a README clarifying that everything in there is there to help in dealing with old versions, but that we won't maintain it at all times?

@kevzettler Are you still working on this ? Or shall we takeover

@nishant-sachdeva I have moved on. Please takeover.

I think that we shouldn't add this to the repo unless we can ensure that it actually builds the binaries correctly. And to do that, this should run the full test suite and the [bytecode comparison](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/t-bytecode-compare.yml) on the binaries. Both of which are not that easy for such old versions. But I think it's really important because it's not hard to get binaries that seem to work but do not actually reproduce the bytecode. We had such problems in the past, e.g. #10183.

If we're sure the binaries built by this are correct, we could actually build them and add them to solc-bin. But if not, this would need a huge disclaimers that it may or may not built them correctly. And in that case it might be better off living somewhere outside of the official repo.

Since we haven't made progress on deciding where to put these yet, but it doesn't look like we'll merge them in the main repo, I'm closing this PR - the scripts will still remain here for reference, resp. for once we find a better place for them.
