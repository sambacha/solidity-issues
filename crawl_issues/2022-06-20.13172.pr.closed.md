PR extends ExpressionAnnotation with new field that is used to keep variable types that expression results are eventually assigned to. So that, inline array components are converted directly to the final type without intermediate steps that relies on type deduction with mobile types usage. That allows to use all information about inline array components (e.g. literals) to decide if implicit conversion is possible or not.
