## Abstract

Consider following struct:

```sol
struct Foo {
    bool val1;
    bool val2;
    bool val3;
    bool val4;
}
```

When abiencoded value Foo(true, true, false, true) translates into `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`, while it could be just `1101`.

## Motivation

Since gas usage is a big topic almost all big ethereum projects use tight structs packing to save caller funds. You can see it in the wild everywhere, e.g. [1Inch limit orders](https://github.com/1inch/limit-order-protocol/blob/179b4fef24bec0a043b45e5d7a4412de6cc7864c/contracts/OrderRFQMixin.sol#L23) encodes order Id and timestamp into `Order.info` or [Uniswap V3 swaps](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L547) encodes zeroForOne and oneForZero fees into `feeProtocol` field. There are other examples in the wild. Since it's a repeatable pattern which is kinda error-prone and dull I think it just might be worthwhile to move this to compiler and code generation.

## Specification

Introduce new keyword `packed` that changes ABI representation and field access. It might look like:

```sol
struct packed Foo {
    bool val1;
    bool val2;
    bool val3;
    bool val4;
}
```

This struct should be only 4 bytes long. When abiencoded it might look like `00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001101` or `11010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` depending on if we want `bytes` or `uint` zeroing pattern. Compiler is responsible for generating appropriate bit shifts and masks when reading and writing fields:

```sol
foo.val2 = true; // foo = foo & (1 << 1)
```

Note that unlike current behavior this should affect calldata representation as well as inner storage.

## Backwards Compatibility

Since this proposal introduces a new keyword it doesn't change meaning for any existing code.

## Additional considerations

It may be also worthwhile to consider packed arrays like:

```sol
function bar(uint8[] packed calldata foo) external {
}
```

so it doesn't put padding zeroes between elements, but unaligned access from those might be tricky and come with surprise costs.

Hi so ideas on all this?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
