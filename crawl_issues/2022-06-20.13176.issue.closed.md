## Description

Slice of `bytes calldata` should have the same type `bytes calldata`, but it is unexpectedly `bytes calldata slice`.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.15

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
library Calldata {
    function parseAddress(bytes calldata data) internal pure returns(address ret) {
        assembly {
            ret := shr(96, calldataload(data.offset))
        }
    }
}

contract CalldataMagic {
    using Calldata for bytes;
    
    function f(bytes calldata data, uint256 offset) external pure returns(address) {
        return data[offset:offset+20].parseAddress();
    }
}
```
-->
```
TypeError: Member "parseAddress" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in bytes calldata slice.
--> contracts/1_Storage.sol:20:16:
|
20 | return data[offset:offset+20].parseAddress();
| ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Found way to handle this, but I would prefer to have this working without tricks:
```solidity
return data[offset:offset+20].parseAddress();
```
=>
```solidity
bytes calldata subdata = data[offset:offset+20];
return subdata.parseAddress();
```

This is not critical, but looks strange

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

I believe this issue deserve to be fixed
