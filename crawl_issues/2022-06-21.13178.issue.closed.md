# [\#13178 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13178) `closed`: Z3 build error

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9196362?u=154113f5ba742f00f85069b182e0f89c75019637&v=4" width="50">[timweri](https://github.com/timweri) opened issue at [2022-06-21 04:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13178):

## Description

I followed the build guide [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source) but ran into a build error with Z3:
```
/home/timweri/GitFolders/solidity/libsmtutil/Z3Interface.cpp: In member function ‘solidity::smtutil::Expression solidity::smtutil::Z3Interface::fromZ3Expr(const z3::expr&)’:
/home/timweri/GitFolders/solidity/libsmtutil/Z3Interface.cpp:381:11: error: ‘Z3_OP_RECURSIVE’ was not declared in this scope; did you mean ‘Z3_OP_RE_RANGE’?
  381 |   kind == Z3_OP_RECURSIVE
      |           ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      |           Z3_OP_RE_RANGE
make[2]: *** [libsmtutil/CMakeFiles/smtutil.dir/build.make:132: libsmtutil/CMakeFiles/smtutil.dir/Z3Interface.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:539: libsmtutil/CMakeFiles/smtutil.dir/all] Error 2
```

This is the same compiler error in #13121. However, I think the root cause is different because my z3 version is the latest (v4.8.17) and the latest solidity source code is checked out. The build script detects the correct version of z3 and does not complain that it's old.

## Environment

- Compiler version: GNU 9.4.0
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): solidity 0.8.16
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): zsh + nvim
- z3: 4.8.17
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04.4 WSL2

## Steps to Reproduce

- Clone solidity repo
- Install other dependencies
- Install v4.8.17 z3
- Run `./scripts/build.sh`

## Extra details

I'm new to the Ethereum community and trying to contribute to solidity. I've tried multiple things, including installing multiple versions of z3 and turning z3 off with `-DUSE_Z3=OFF`. The build runs fine with z3 off so I assume z3 is the problem.

Here's is the build log:

Turns out my default include search space for GCC is misconfigured so the `z3++.h` file was not found by the compiler.

Hi, I have the exact same error. As far as I can see, gcc has the path to `z3++.h` in its search path. What do you mean by 'misconfigured'?

Because it seems that when I run:

```bash
$ cat /usr/include/z3*.h | grep Z3_OP_RE_RANGE
```

Something can be found.

But when I run:

```bash
$cat /usr/include/z3*.h | grep Z3_OP_RECURSIVE
```

I get no results.

I am using `z3 v4.8.15`.

I will have a look if other z3 versions do use `Z3_OP_RECURSIVE` for example.

Hi. My error was that I didn't have the `z3*.h` in the search path but you already have that correct. However, `cat /usr/include/z3*.h | grep Z3_OP_RECURSIVE` does show me a result.

You can try a later version of Z3. The last time I checked, you need Z3 4.11.0.0 but I believe they might have upgraded the required version again.

You need specifically 4.11.2 if you want all SMT tests to pass: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b49dac7a8e02005fbc26e3dbd99e9b40ab79a21c/CMakeLists.txt#L78

If you don't care about that, earlier versions should work just fine but you have to actually tell the build system you don't care by setting `-DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF`.

We're ABI compatible down to 4.8.0 and that's the minimal requirement. Since we use `Z3_OP_RECURSIVE`, though I guess this makes the actual minimum 4.8.16 that introduced it.

@leonardoalt I guess we could actually consider it a small bug then? I.e. we should either raise the requirement or add some ifdefs to make it still work down to 4.8.0?

@enzeve I'll keep this issue closed because in the end, as @timweri says, the problem was different but you could report this mismatch as a separate bug. In any case, for now you need at least 0.8.16 to compile without patching the sources.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) commented at [2022-12-09 09:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13178#issuecomment-1344079781):

Yea so what happened with 4.8.15 was that z3 released a patch version, 4.8.16, with a breaking API that includes `Z3_OP_RECURSIVE`. Solidity 0.8.14 was then compiled and released using z3 4.8.16, supporting `Z3_OP_RECURSIVE`.

So yea I guess we should bump the minimum z3 required version to 4.8.16 to **compile** Solidity with z3.

The tricky bit is that if you use `solc` on Linux with `dlopen`ed z3, it's actually fine for z3 to have an older version than that.
So different z3 versions are required for different things.

Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13792 to take care of that.

Thanks for flagging!

Great to see the quick responses! 

I was using `-DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF -DUSE_Z3_DLOPEN=ON` (and also tried adding `-DUSE_Z3=OFF`), because I wanted to be able to load z3 dynamically. But it seems that even with `-DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF` the error came up. And I'm using z3 v4.8.15 because [kevm stated that it requires that version](https://github.com/runtimeverification/evm-semantics#installing-z3) and I'm also using that. So I was trying to avoid using multiple versions. But I'm now installing z3 v4.8.16 to see if kevm will still work with this version.

But the problem of different tools requiring different z3 versions is of course not a problem for the Solidity team.

Thanks for the help!

Edit: It seems like KEVM also works with z3 v4.8.16 (at least for the features I use of that so far).
