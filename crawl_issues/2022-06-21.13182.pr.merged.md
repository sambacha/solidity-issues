> Are you able to deliver any tests at this stage of implementation?

This is at least partially tested as it replaces/modifies the existing code (and a mistake here would make existing tests fail), but there is no explicit test for the whole declarations array yet.
I thought a bit about further possible tests but I believe the best would be to rely on the tests of the (first) class that'll use this info, which will be my Rename lsp class..
