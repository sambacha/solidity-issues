**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `testing :hammer:`

## Description

Running `./test/externalTests.sh` or any of the individual external test scripts with a relative path to the solc binary causes the tests to fail with an obscure Hardhat message saying "The Solidity version pragma statement in these files doesn't match any of the configured compilers in your config. Change the pragma or configure additional compiler versions in your hardhat config."

At the beginning of the script output, you can see a message saying "test/externalTests/common.sh: line 100: ./build/solc/solc: No such file or directory" so it is clear that the current directory has changed and the relative path is not to the right location anymore.

There's actually a visible attempt to correct this: when configuring hardhat.config.js there is another error message saying "realpath: ./build/solc/solc: No such file or directory".

So the best solution in my opinion is to use realpath on the argument as early as possible.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.16-develop.2022.6.21+commit.c3ea8661.mod.Linux.g++
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): london
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): well, Hardhat
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

`./tests/externalTests.sh native ./build/solc/solc`
