This seems to have been introduced in 0.8.15. On 0.8.14 it correctly reports an error:
```
Error: Empty tuple on the left hand side.
 --> test.sol:2:8:
  |
2 |    ((, ())) = (f, 3);
  |        ^^

Error: Type tuple(function (),int_const 3) is not implicitly convertible to expected type tuple(,tuple()).
 --> test.sol:2:15:
  |
2 |    ((, ())) = (f, 3);
  |               ^^^^^^
```

Also, the problem seems unrelated to the fact that `f` is used in the tuple:
```solidity
function f() {
    ((, ())) = (1, 3);
}
```
```
Uncaught exception:
Dynamic exception type: std::out_of_range
std::exception::what: vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 1) >= this->size() (which is 1)
```
