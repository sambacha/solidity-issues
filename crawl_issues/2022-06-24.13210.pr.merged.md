closes #13106
Error messages now display errors/events type as errors/events and not functions type. Test is added for each case where errors/events were previously described as function type.

For the sake of uniformity, `humanReadable()` is used (instead of `toString()`) on types for error messages even when errors/events cannot be the cause of the errors.

To get the tests working, please rebase on our latest `develop` branch

LGTM, but we should have at least one other reviewer.

I think this is a good change, but I don't think we should introduce the `bool short` parameter for `humanReadableName`.

What `short` does in `toString` is that it adds the data location if it's false and omits the data location if it's true.

What we should do for `humanReadableName` is always print it (if it is a reference type) for the outermost type and omit it for the inner types (because they should have the same data location anyway).

May I suggest that instead of `_short` we call it `_withDataLocation` for `toString`? I can create an issue

Right. I initially didn't want to change the logic of `humanReadableName` or `toString` but I ran into problems where replacing `toString(true)` with `humanReadableName()` would cause some established error messages to change. Since `humanReadableName()` calls `toString(false)` under the hood for some cases, the error message now contains data location.

If changing the data location in the message is more favourable than adding a `humanReadableBool(bool)`, I can update the PR to go that route.

As for this, I assume I can address the change and reference two issues in one PR?

Sure, though do use an extra commit for the renaming

> where replacing toString(true) with humanReadableName() would cause some established error messages to change. 

That's alright if the new message is better, I'd say.

I'm not sure if it's better so I'll include some examples here to see what your opinion is before going ahead with the change.

Also it might make the sentence confusing when the data location looks like a normal English word, and not part of the type name:
```
 Type struct Test.RecursiveStruct memory[1] memory is only valid in storage because it contains a (nested) mapping.
```
vs
```
Type struct Test.RecursiveStruct[1] is only valid in storage because it contains a (nested) mapping.
```

How did you end up with `memory[1] memory` here? :)

Apart from that, I agree that they could be confused for normal words, but I think so far we've been using them this way. 
I personally think having a better way would be good.
Maybe we can think and discuss a syntax people are happy with. e.g. `memory(Test.recursive.Struct)` or ` Test.RecursiveStruct{m}` etc. But that's out of the scope of the PR I'd say.

I used the default `ArrayType::humanReadableName`, which gives that result. Through that I see what @chriseth meant about `ReferenceType` in his comment. I then overrode `ArrayType::humanReadableName` to only print the data location for the outer type and obtained:
```
Type struct Test.RecursiveStruct[1] memory is only valid in storage because it contains a (nested) mapping.
> 
```
```
TypeError 2428: (B:85-105): The type of return parameter 1, string[] memory, is only supported in ABI coder v2. Use "pragma abicoder v2;" to enable the feature.
```

I assume this is the desired result. I'll look for the remaining cases for `ReferenceType`.

That does look indeed like the desired result.
Oh and, I won't be creating an extra issue for the parameter rename if you do it right in this PR, just fyi :)
