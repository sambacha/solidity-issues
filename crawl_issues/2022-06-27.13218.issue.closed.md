In order to allocate new arrays Solidity erases this memory with loop of `MSTORE`s. Same can be achieved with just `CALLDATACOPY` from huge offset like `SHL(255, 1)`.

Initial idea came from this tweet: https://twitter.com/k06a/status/1541392410546159617

## Abstract

Replace:
```solidity
for (uint i = 0 ; i < size; i += 32) {
    MSTORE(ptr + i, 0)
}
```
With this:
```solidity
CALLDATACOPY(ptr, SHL(255, 1), size)
```

## Motivation

It will be much cheaper in terms of gas (no loop overhead) and byte code will be much smaller.

## Backwards Compatibility

Should be fully compatible in terms of behaviour.

The compiler does this partially. The trick is to use `calldatacopy(ptr, calldatasize(), size)`. But I think it can be used for even more cases, so that needs to be investigated.

I hope these quirks can be removed in the future (zero extension and memory expansion ignoring high offsets is nasty).

I see `CALLDATACOPY(*, CALLDATASIZE(), *)` happens in some cases, but not in all of them

I'm interested in a temperature check about a potential [`mzero` instruction](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/mzero-instruction/11713).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
