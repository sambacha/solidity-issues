I thought we had such an issue open as it is a recurring question we have discussed.

It would be nice to turn on the optimizer by default, as we expect deployments to use. In the case of the IR pipeline it is even a requirement, and compilation more than likely will fail without it.

Hi. I'm interested in working on this issue. From a little reading, I assume the first step would be changing the default behaviour in `CommandLineParser.cpp`. And then look around for any functions that hardcode the minimal Optimisation mode like `CompilerStack::reset` and change those.

I'm not sure what else would need to be done as of now. I would definitely appreciate some guidance. :)

@timweri For now this is just a proposal. We don't know if we'll do it yet, though it does seem like a good idea. I'm adding to the agenda for the next meeting but until we make a decision there's really nothing to do here.

BTW, this would be a breaking change for CLI and Standard JSON, wouldn't it? Is this something we would even be willing to do before 0.9?

I think it would be breaking, as it is a behavioural change. One could argue it is less severe as other breaking changes, so could fit in a non-breaking release.

Update: on one of the recent calls we decided to do it in 0.9.0, with same default for both pipelines for consistency.

Linking this to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14149 which will basically solve this.

Well, it will make issues with unoptimized code go away but didn't we also generally want to have the optimizer enabled as the best default for users?

Well, yeah, maybe it's not fully solved, but it's linked at least - the ``In the case of the IR pipeline it is even a requirement, and compilation more than likely will fail without it.`` part should end up being addressed in more cases by that (even though there's some more work in the code transform and stack-to-memory required for it to work better)
