partially solves #12778 

- [x]  Document this case.
- [-] Improve the error message. ( postponing this for a future PR. Will be resolved once a decision is taken regarding https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12778#issuecomment-1212996300 )
- [x] Add semantic and syntax tests covering all possible location combinations here.

Some ideas: 
- add a `bool` member to `FunctionType` class and then set it inside `FunctionType::asExternallyCallableFunction `, so we can track when the arguments were converted, or;
- If possible, compare parameter types as defined in the declaration of the function against the provided type for the function pointer value. I guess that this should also detect when the parameter types have been modified by `FunctionType::asExternallyCallableFunction ` and there is no need to modify `FunctionType`. Again, If possible. I am not sure this can be implemented...

I think that there is not a single point where this can be checked, but I might as well be wrong (very probable) since I am not familiar with the code. So, assuming that, I think that it is necessary to perform the check in the appropriate locations where there are assignments, parameter passing and other relevant manipulations of function pointers.

There was an error when running `chk_coding_style` for commit `b94a3a77f436883f3509b295fe08f801bea20e7d`:

Error: Trailing whitespace found:
