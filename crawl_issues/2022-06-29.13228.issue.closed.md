The repo hasn't changed so maybe something on our end broke it?
Finding the offending commit might help

fyi, we currently pinpointed this to the last working commit, but this still needs doing.

[Edit] Confused the issue, disregard.

It's weird then. I see that the test still points at `main` branch of the [gp-v2-contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts) repo and that did not have any new commits recently (in fact the repo archived and I was going to submit a PR to switch to the new one but that's a separate matter).

So why did it stop failing? Was it just a one-off problem?

Sorry, I confused the issue with the ens external test

Ah, ok then. So I guess this one got fixed on its own?
Could have been a bug in some dependency or Hardhat that just got fixed quickly.
