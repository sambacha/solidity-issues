I was writing smart contracts and at some point like traditional programming , I want to reset the mapping to its initial stage so far till now there are no such method to delete or erase contents of mapping. Please issue this feature

This is not really feasible in the EVM. For one, the `mapping` doesn't know about what locations are active (you need something like enumerable mappings to do this). Secondly, erasing slots is gas intensive and easily lead to DOS issues.

Closing this.
