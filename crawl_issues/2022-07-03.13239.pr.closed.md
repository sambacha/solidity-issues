### Placeholder Documentation

**Why you made your change**

_When I recently read the Solidity docs, I felt that there wasn't enough information on placeholders used within modifiers._

This question has been [asked before](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/19171/what-does-underscore-do).

**What you did**

I wrote up a quick blurb on what the underscore (placeholder) operator does, with additional mentions that it is unrelated to _prefix or suffix_ uses of underscores. 

I also included a code example of a common _mutex_ modifier.

_Disclaimer: I am not experienced with .rst files, so if I have made a referencing mistake please let me know and I will fix it._

Thanks!

CircleCI thinks I'm writing C++. 

Let me know what I need to do and I'll do it.

You probably mean the failing `chk_coding_style` job? It's exactly what it says, i.e. you seem to have left some whitespace past the end of line in a few places. It tells you on which lines it found it. This is flagged because randomly adding and removing this just adds noise to diffs and makes them harder to read. Please configure your editor to remove trailing whitespace automatically.

```
Error: Trailing whitespace found:
docs/contracts/placeholders.rst:15:	modifier mutex {  
docs/contracts/placeholders.rst:16:		require(!lock);  
docs/contracts/placeholders.rst:17:		lock = true;  
docs/contracts/placeholders.rst:19:		lock = false;  
docs/contracts/placeholders.rst:23:A simple way of thinking of this modifier is as a function which wraps the original function, in which case the placeholder operator would represent where we call our original function. 
```

Thanks for this, I will close this one as I have created another PR for the function-modifiers.rst file.
