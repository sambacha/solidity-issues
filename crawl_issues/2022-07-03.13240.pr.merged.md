Test cases were getting build errors with - simple problems with unsigned vs int - static_cast applied.  

- BOOST_LIB_VERSION "1_79"
- g++ (Raspbian 8.3.0-6+rpi1) 8.3.0
- 5.10.17-v7l+ armv7l GNU/Linux

It is only a problem since `all warnings being treated as errors`

So looks like this is because ARMv7l is 32-bit and the difference type is deduced to be `int` (and needs an explicit conversion from `unsigned`) while on x64 it probably ends up as a bigger type that can represent all values from both `int` and `unsigned`.

We should really have some 32-bit target in CI (apparently we even have an issue to do this: #4027) though I'm not sure if CircleCI even supports that. So thanks for submitting the PR, we would not have detected that otherwise. And nice that these 3 warnings were the only problems that actually were there.

BTW, I see that you closed this for some reason. I'm going to reopen and merge.

I think actually some on 32bit envs  `-Werror=sign-conversion ` flag is getting set but it's not set on 64bit linux or other environments.   A simple test example 

`
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        unsigned x = 1;
        int y = 1;
        y = x + y;
        cout << x << " " << sizeof(unsigned) << endl;
        cout << y << " " << sizeof(int) << endl;
        return 0;
}
`
Compiles fine with -Wall but if -Werror=sign-conversion  is included on armv7l or **x86_64**  then it fails.   Hope this is helpful. I might investigate further.
