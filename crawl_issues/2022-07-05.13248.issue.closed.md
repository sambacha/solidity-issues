# [\#13248 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13248) `closed`: Inlining Functions That Only Use Variables Passed As Argument
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

## Abstract

This is a feature request for the optimizer to inline functions in a specific case.

If a function only use variables passed as argument, inlining the function does not increase the variables on the stack and therefore cannot cause a "Stack too deep" error.  It should be reasonably straightforward to inline such functions.  If such a function is private or internal and is only used once, it would always be more efficient to inline this function.

This feature request was suggested in a comment in #12782

## Motivation

The issue describes a specific case in which inlining functions is always more efficient.

## Specification

Whenever a private or internal function is only used once and this function uses only variables that are passed as argument, the function should be inlined.

## Backwards Compatibility

This feature request does not change the language and does not impact backward compatibility.

I made a prototype project at https://github.com/toongeorges/cryptoshares/
You could use the code in https://github.com/toongeorges/cryptoshares/blob/main/solidity/contracts/base/CorporateActions.sol as a test case:
there is one function `executeCorporateAction` that conditionally calls one of several other functions.  I did not want to write these functions inline.  The compiler however should inline these functions (if the feature is implemented).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

this is relevant, please reopen it, there are common patterns like creating a custom type which is a "zero cost abstraction" but the moment you write functions for the custom type, i believe it adds jumps, etc. which is not zero cost currently
