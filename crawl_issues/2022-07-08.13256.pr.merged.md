Added build flag `DISABLE_WARNINGS` which is OFF by default and disables warnings.

Potentially closes #13146

The PR looks fine to me in the current form but the last thing that is missing is the extra bit of docs (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13256#discussion_r923560310). Other than that, we could merge it right away.

I added a bit of docs about the new flag. The PR is complete now.
