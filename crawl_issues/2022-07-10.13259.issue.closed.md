## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

Sometimes compiling via IR results in the following error (with Foundry):
```
❯ forge build
[⠆] Compiling...
[⠆] Compiling 69 files with 0.8.15
[⠔] Solc 0.8.15 finished in 3.00s
Error: 
Compiler run failed
InternalCompilerError: Invalid stack item name: slot
```

As the error implies, it seems to be related to storing variables that point to storage slots.

## Environment

- Compiler version: reproduced with 0.8.15,0.8.14,0.8.13
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Foundry
- Operating system: macOS

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...

In my case, I was able to resolve this by changing the following code from this:

```solidity
        mapping(uint256 => address) storage tokenApprovalsPtr = _tokenApprovals;
        // The following is equivalent to `approvedAddress = _tokenApprovals[tokenId]`.
        assembly {
            // Compute the slot.
            mstore(0x00, tokenId)
            mstore(0x20, tokenApprovalsPtr.slot)
            approvedAddressSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
            // Load the slot's value from storage.
            approvedAddress := sload(approvedAddressSlot)
        }
```

to this:


```solidity
        // The following is equivalent to `approvedAddress = _tokenApprovals[tokenId]`.
        assembly {
            // Compute the slot.
            mstore(0x00, tokenId)
            mstore(0x20, _tokenApprovals.slot)
            approvedAddressSlot := keccak256(0x00, 0x40)
            // Load the slot's value from storage.
            approvedAddress := sload(approvedAddressSlot)
        }
```

While the code I changed is [copied from the ERC721A repo](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/blob/7819fc341da2fece936688239c66b702f7c8add8/contracts/ERC721A.sol#L585), I'm able to build the code at that commit as-is without issues, with the IR pipeline enabled.

Thanks for the report! This indeed seems to be a bug in the compiler. I managed to create a smaller repro (see below). Simply using `.slot` on a storage reference to a mapping in assembly triggers it.

Looks like the bug has been there all the way since the IR was introduced (or at least the `--ir` option) in 0.5.8. Back then the syntax was `_slot`, not `.slot` though. Between 0.5.10 and 0.7.0 it was causing an uncaught exception in `map::at()` but starting with 0.7.1 it's again an ICE.

### Repro
`test.sol`:
```solidity
contract C  {
    mapping(uint => uint) private m;

    function g() public {
        mapping(uint => uint) storage mPtr = m;
        assembly {
            pop(mPtr.slot)
        }
    }
}
```
```
solc test.sol --ir
```
```
Internal compiler error:
/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ir/IRVariable.cpp(52): Throw in function solidity::frontend::IRVariable solidity::frontend::IRVariable::part(const std::string&) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Invalid stack item name: slot
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Invalid stack item name: slot
```
