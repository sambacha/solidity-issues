# [\#13266 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13266) `closed`: `abi.encodeCall()` segfaults in a free function when passed an error/event
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should report better error`

```
error Error(string);
error Panic(uint);

function panic(uint code)
{
  bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(Panic, code);
  assembly "evmasm" ("memory-safe") {
    revert(data, mload(data))
  }
}
```

The compiler segfaults...

This seems to have started with 0.8.12. Before then it would be an error: `Error: Function must be "public" or "external".`

Simpler repro with the same effect:
```solidity
error E(uint);

function f() {
    abi.encodeCall(E, (1));
}
```
```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

Events are affected too:
```solidity
library L {
    event E(uint);
}

function f() {
    abi.encodeCall(L.E, (1));
}
```
```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

The free function seems to be an important element because it does not segfault in a contract:
```solidity
contract C {
    error E(uint);

    function f() internal {
        abi.encodeCall(E, (1));
    }
}
```
```
Error: Expected regular external function type, or external view on public function. Cannot use special function. Did you forget to prefix "this."?
 --> test.sol:5:24:
  |
5 |         abi.encodeCall(E, (1));
  |                        ^
Note: Function is declared here:
 --> test.sol:2:5:
  |
2 |     error E(uint);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

So the fact that it segfaults is definitely a bug but the fact that it does not work with errors/events is just a missing feature (which seems like something we should have though).
