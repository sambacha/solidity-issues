If I am understanding correctly storage layout for arrays, there is a missing word in the docs for the storage layout of arrays. See file changes.

Thank you for your contribution! The slot represents the array. What is stored there is the length. So I would say the current wording is conceptually correct while the change adds a complication.

@cameel here is a new suggestion for this section.

Maybe breaking this down into bullet points could fit nicely, making it easier to read and in turns make the layout for these two variable types easier to understand.

Here is my proposal extended from yours:

```
``bytes`` and ``string`` are encoded identically. In general, the encoding is similar to ``bytes1[]``. The layout in storage for these types depends on the ``.length``:

- For short values (shorter than 32 bytes) the array elements are stored together with the length in the same slot.
- For long values (more than 32 bytes), the length is stored in one slot (which position is defined as per the [storage layout rules](#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage)), while the array elements are stored in a separately allocated data area whose location is computed using a ``keccak256`` hash of that slot's position.
```

@cameel @chriseth @vaibhav4516 any updates? What do you think of the suggested changes in my last commit?

Coding style check is failing; you can either check the failed CI job, or even better, run `./scripts/check_style.sh` locally after making changes.

The PR seems to change the docs in a way that the reviewers disagree, so I'm closing it for now. Reviewers please comment otherwise.
