The reason why CI did not fail for that is because it's simply reported as message, and our CI test client does not strictly evaluate trace messages in that regard. I am also not sure that should be done or if that would be overkill. Nevertheless, that's fixing not having `include-paths` specified in the custom settings.

As for traces, maybe they should be included as expectations in test files, the same way we include emitted events in compiler's semantic tests?

we could have that as a separate-PR thing, with some feedback from @Marenz later. But thanks so far :)
