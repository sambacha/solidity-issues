There are plenty of diagnostics that could have some quick (auto) fixes.

For example (but not limited to!):

* visibility restrictions can be auto-fixed to.
* unused variables could be removed or commented out
* symbolic capitalization
* symbolic misspellings
* superfluous `;` or unary `+`/`-` operators
* missing imports
* wrong lookup (used `A.f` or just `f` but should be `B.f`)
* extract into function
* add `pragma version ...` if missing
* add SPDX license header if missing
* remove pragmas whose enabled features are not in use
* `import *` to explicit import statements
* ...?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
