Follow up to issue #9601 and pull request #13163.
Based on advice by @cameel in the conversation in issue.
Previously `formatNumberReadable(57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968) `would equal to `0x80 * 2 ** 248`, but now it equals to `2 ** 255`.
Also, there was a bug in the test case `test_format_number_readable_signed` in `test/StringUtils.cpp`. `formatNumberReadable(-0xffffffff)` should be equal to `-2 ** 32 + 1` but previously it was tested to be equal to `-2 ** 32 - 1`. The new version of `formatNumberReadable` fixes this problem.

I think this is in good shape. Please, rebase.

Auto please rebase onto origin/develop to get rid of the CI errors.

No need to apologize, you are not late at all. You are actually quite timely with your responses. Thanks for contributing to the project :)

The errors in CircleCI seem to be related to not being able to find `fmt::format`. Does CircleCI not use the fmt library?

It's there but we added it as a dependency very recently so not all of our libs link to it yet. You have to add it to `target_link_libraries` in `libsolutil/CMakeLists.txt`. See how #13473 does it.

Also, @nikola-matic are you satisfied with the current replacements of string concatenation or do you think that they are needed for the simple cases at lines `133`, `203` and `218`?

The formatting looks good now, and no, no need for `fmt::format` for simple cases. Another rebase would be nice to get rid of the `gp2` failure.

Yes, I added them at lines `185`, `186`, `285` and `286`. I added some more tests now just to make sure.

I am also removing the `std::to_string` functions, and rebasing the code to the latest version.

@matheusaaguiar @ekpyron will this need a changelog entry?

I'd say, it's borderline. But strictly speaking it's user-facing, so we can just default to "yes".

@Ruko97 , please add a [Changelog](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/46a7ebd5b66c5638427295b9c3dbf15fc48c4ed2/Changelog.md) entry under the `Compiler Features` section, describing shortly the improvement on readability of large/hex numbers. Also, the fixed bug, under section `Bugfixes`.

Rebased, resolved conflicts, and added periods to changelog entires. The build should now be fine, and hopefully closer to merging.
