Thanks for the fix, this seems to have been rather tricky!
Is it an option to - instead of skipping the cleanup altogether - do a non-destructive cleanup, i.e. we first read, zero out some bits and then write again?

I don't see the use of any clean up in this context to be honest. We are simply writing `0`s to the 32 bytes after copying the static calldata array.. I don't see why we do that or what benefit we have from that...

We don't need cleanup for arrays of `uint256` and `bytes32` but for `bytes` and `string` I think we still do. And this function is handling both cases. Can you add the cleanup tests I mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13282#discussion_r926969959? They should show that after the change byte arrays are no longer cleaned.

Also, this needs a rebase now that the OZ fix has been merged.

Rebased to make the external tests pass.
