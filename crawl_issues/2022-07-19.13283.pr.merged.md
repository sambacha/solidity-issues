This PR extends yulRunner with an interactive debugger interface.

This is not yet cleaned up, but the code is in a working state and was used for debugging

Is the yul mode for remix working for this case?

I don't about any yul mode for remix and couldn't find any info after some short googling?

There's [a dropdown that lets you select Yul](https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compile.html#solidity-or-yul) in the compiler tab.

While I appreciate all the comments and feedback, I also feel that all of you forget that this is not part of the compiler and I think it shouldn't be held to the same standard, simply because it's not worth the time and effort here. 

It's just a tool for us, after all.
I wrote this because I needed it and it provides value, but i am not sure we should invest so much time to make this "perfect"

Pinging @bshastry about this one, just to confirm that the interpreter changes won't interfere with fuzzing (since most of it is conditional behind the flag, it shouldn't affect much, but still).

I didn't quite follow. What do you mean by the previous return values of ``Call`` instructions

Well, the old code would return `gas() & 1` so it would randomly fail or succeed. 
We assumed it is deliberate but didn't know the exact motivation for it.
