# [\#13288 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13288) `closed`: Eliminate array bounds check for trivial case
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `nice to have`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

The following code seems to do the bounds check even though it is trivially unnecessary.

```solidity
uint[] memory a = new uint[](1);
a[0] = x;
```

Ideally the optimizer would also catch less trivial but apparently easy cases like for loops where the index is checked to be in bounds as part of the loop condition.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
