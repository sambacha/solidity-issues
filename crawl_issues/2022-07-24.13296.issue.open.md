# [\#13296 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13296) `open`: Clarify the difference between `--yul`, `--assemble` and `--strict-assembly` in the CLI help
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `low effort`, `medium impact`, `must have eventually`

On the CLI we have 3 options for compiling Yul, and they're different but their descriptions do not explain how. To users `--yul` seems like the natural choice and the result is confusion (e.g. [How to compile IR into bin?](https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/how-to-compile-ir-into-bin/1146)).

The options will likely change after #7830 but we should clarify the CLI help even before then.

### Current descriptions
```
  --assemble           Switch to assembly mode, ignoring all options except 
                       --machine, --yul-dialect, --optimize and 
                       --yul-optimizations and assumes input is assembly.
  --yul                Switch to Yul mode, ignoring all options except 
                       --machine, --yul-dialect, --optimize and 
                       --yul-optimizations and assumes input is Yul.
  --strict-assembly    Switch to strict assembly mode, ignoring all options 
                       except --machine, --yul-dialect, --optimize and 
                       --yul-optimizations and assumes input is strict 
                       assembly.
```
