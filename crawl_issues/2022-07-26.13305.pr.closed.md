@cameel following your instructions in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11351#issuecomment-1072653767, note that at the moment CircleCI doesn't support docker in ARM, so you'll see the workflow is slightly different. Is this approach reasonable (if I finish the PR will be merged?).

@willianpaixao Do you want to continue working on this? Need any help?

I'm going to close this but feel free to reopen if you'd like to resume working on this (or anyone else for that matter). If not, we'll eventually do it ourselves, though at the moment there are just too many topics and this one is not the top priority so it has to wait for its turn.
