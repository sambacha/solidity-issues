## Abstract

Add a specific overflow check optimization that will make many for-loop optimizations unnecessary.

## Motivation

Too many people are saying this is bad:

```solidity
for (uint256 mintCounter = 0; mintCounter < quantity; mintCounter++) {
    _mint(msg.sender, _assembleTokenID(dropID, mintCounter));
}
```

compared to this:

```solidity
for (uint256 mintCounter = 0; mintCounter < quantity;) {
    _mint(msg.sender, _assembleTokenID(dropID, mintCounter));
    unchecked{
        mintCounter++
    }
}       
```

## Specification

### Note

For reference, a for-loop like this:

```
for (A; B; C) {D}
```

is implemented like this:

```basic
10 A

100 if !B GOTO 999
110 D
120 C
130 GOTO 100

999 EXIT
```

### New optimization

If inside a single code unit, if:

1. a variable has bit width X,
2. the variable is compared to be less than some quantity with bit width <=X,
3. the variable is not set until step 4 here, then
4. the variable is incremented;

then that incrementation in step 4 need not be safety checked. Or in $\LaTeX$:

$$x < a <= w \implies x+1 <= w$$

### Documentation

People like being fancy, so even if this is implemented, they will still use the `unchecked` "optimization" until it can be clearly explained that it is unnecessary.

So the documentation should be updated to specify that the gas cost of this code:

```solidity
contract C {
    event E;
    constructor(uint256 count) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            emit E(i);
        }
    }
}
```

shall not exceed that of this code:

```solidity
contract CUnchecked {
    event E;
    constructor(uint256 count) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count;) {
            unchecked {
                emit E(i);
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And this can be checked with a test case.

There is precedent in this with JavaScript where the specification requires that implementations implement tail-end recursion optimization.

The second optimization is:

If inside a single code unit, if:

1. an unsigned variable is compared to be greater than some value,
2. the variable is not set until step 3 here, then
3. the variable is decremented,

then that decrementation in step 3 need not be safety checked. Or in $\LaTeX$:

$$x > a >= 0 \implies x-1 > = 0$$

I see where this comes from, my first thought however is an fancy endles loop thats been created like that if for loops are optimized with your idea.

```
uint256 quantity = 100000;
for (uint8 mintCounter = 0; mintCounter < quantity; mintCounter++)
{
    _mint(msg.sender, _assembleTokenID(dropID, mintCounter));
}
```
This would result in an infinite loop if I am not mistaken.
Of cource the unchecked code example will too but there it is the devs fault entirely.

@migoldfinger That code example would NOT be optimized.

The rule is (emphasis added):

> 1. a variable <ins>has bit width X</ins>,
> 2. the variable is compared to be less than <ins>some quantity with bit width <=X</ins>,
> 3. ...

The rule would not be applied because the "some quantity's" bit width (i.e. `uint256`) is not less than or equal to the variable's bit width (i.e. `uint8`).

Any counterexample, regardless of how farfetched, is welcome if it would cause this optimization to be behavior-changing.

Yeah, this is a known issue - we have experimental research towards general reasoning- and SMT-based optimizations that are intended to be powerful enough to remove the overflow checks in these (and more general) cases without special-case handling - but since it's unlikely that this will be production-ready in the immediate future, we could indeed consider a dedicated and well-defined special-case optimization for this.

The alternative we usually suggest is to define an iterator type as user-defined value type, which has only an increment operation and thereby cannot overflow by design and implement its increment using unchecked arithmetic - especially since we'll probably have user-defined operators on user-defined value types soon (I'd estimate 0.8.17), this may not affect readability (too) negatively (unfortunately we won't have ``++`` at least in the first version, though, so it'd have to be ``i = i + 1``).

Even without user-defined value types, you can already now write:
```
function unsafe_inc(uint i) pure returns (uint) { unchecked { return i + 1; } }
contract C {
    event E;
    constructor(uint256 count) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < count; i = unsafe_inc(i)) {
            emit E(i);
        }
    }
}
```
which should have equal cost to the version with the increment moved into the loop body and which is arguably at least a bit less horrible.


All that as a rough description of the status quo. Given that none of the available solutions are at the same time overly nice and expected to be production ready in the short term, it does make sense to consider a dedicated optimization step with well-defined guarantees as suggested, though.

If not that, we should at least prominently document the currently available best-practice alternatives. I thought we had that in the docs, but on a quick search right now, I didn't actually see it.

We had an initial discussion about this today and decided that we want to further explore a few options.
- @hrkrshnn will check, if it's feasible to accelerate getting an experimental difference solver for the optimizer ready for reliably dealing with the resulting patterns on the Yul level.
- I just created a draft implementation for special-case syntactic analysis in solidity similar to what's suggested in this issue, only restricted to only loop-conditions and loop-post-expressions specifically in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13378
- We should probably also write up versions that avoid the issue using a loop counter type as user-defined value type (pre and post the upcoming user-defined-operator and -literal PRs).

Unstale.

This one is important.
