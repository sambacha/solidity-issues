# [\#13313 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13313) `merged`: fix: global state object in yul formal specification

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22668539?u=a36b5a7e1d873cee1edb777bac94211911e60b05&v=4" width="50">[QGarchery](https://github.com/QGarchery) opened issue at [2022-07-28 09:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13313):

This PR is about the [yul formal specification](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/yul.html#formal-specification).

The following points seems to be small issues in the specification:
- line 666, the original specification says that the storage variables cannot be modified in assignments. The following test suggests otherwise
```solidity
    function testYulDropGlobalInAssignment() public {
        uint y;
        assembly {
            let value := 2
            function storeAndReturn(a) -> res {
                sstore(x.slot, a)
                res := a
            }
            y := storeAndReturn(3)
        }
        assertEq(x, y); // does not drop the x value in storage after assigning y
    }
```
- line 669, the original specification seems to have a typo in it because `L1` is used later but is not defined
- line 689, the original specification says that the storage is not modified in the post of a loop if the resulting mode is `leave`. The following test suggests otherwise
```solidity
    function testYulDropGlobalInPostWhenLeave() public {
        assembly {
            function storeAndLeave() {
                for { } true { sstore(x.slot, 5) leave } {}
            }
            storeAndLeave()
        }
        assertEq(x, 5); // does not drop the x value in storage after leaving in the post of the loop
    }
```
