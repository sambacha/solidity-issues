## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library MyLib {
    uint internal constant val1 = 3;


    uint internal constant useVal1InMyLib = val1 / 2;
}

contract MyContract {
    uint constant useVal1InMyContract = MyLib.val1 / 2; // this line errors
}
```

Error:

```
TypeError: Initial value for constant variable has to be compile-time constant.
--> contracts/Const.sol:12:41:
|
12 | uint constant useVal1InMyContract = MyLib.val1 / 2;
| ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Since the val1 is marked as constant, it is seen as compile time constant in MyLib, but it should be compile time constant in MyContract too.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.15
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): berlin
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: hardhat
- Operating system: macos

Thanks the the report! Looks like this has already been reported before (#12927) and a fix was released in 0.8.16, soon after you reported it so we can close it.
