Hey all, this PR adds a GitPOAP Badge to the README that displays the number of minted GitPOAPs for this repository by contributors to this repo.

You can see an example of this in our Documentation repository.

This should help would-be contributors as well as existing contributors find out that they will/have received GitPOAPs for their contributions.

Hi, Thanks for this suggestion! We won't move forward with this at this point since we try to keep our Readme as clean as possible. We only list the absolutely necessary links as badges. This is currently limited to how to get in touch with the Solidity compiler team, the forum to contribute to language design and how to stay up-to-date.
