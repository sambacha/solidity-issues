Fixes #13336 
Adding this rule in my browser fixes the issue (see screenshots in issue for what it looks like).  I'm *guessing* this file is the right place to add a new CSS rule to the page, but I'm not super confident about that part.

Somewhat indifferent on the change. Maybe @franzihei has an opinion here.

Also, PR number ðŸ‘€

Hahaha!  I didn't notice the PR number until you mentioned it, but that is some serious voodoo coincidence right there...  ðŸ˜–   I am willing to close this PR and open a new one if that is desired.  ðŸ˜¬

The general sentiment among EF UI experts was "do not do this", so I'm closing this for now :-). But this triggered some discussion about the docs theme, so there may be some changes upcoming due to this :-).

We can reopen, if https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13336 starts leaning towards doing this after all.
