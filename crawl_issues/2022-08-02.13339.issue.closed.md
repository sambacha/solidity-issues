## Abstract

The type-safe `ab.encodeCall(f, args)` should be extended for custom errors.

## Motivation

It's very common in testing frameworks to encode custom errors (to check if a call reverts with the specified encoding). This is currently done by using `abi.encodeWithSignature('error_signature", ...)` or `abi.encodeWithSelector(error.selector, ...)`.

Decision to use `abi.encodeError` instead of `abi.encodeCall`.

Is anyone attempting this? May I take it?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

This feature would be very useful when checking for errors in Forge:

```solidity
vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeError(MyContract.MyError, arg1, arg2));
```

Is anything like this still being considered?
