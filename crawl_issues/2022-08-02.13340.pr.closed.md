Thanks for opening the PR! It looks like the docs in this case were a bit outdated (aside from being somewhat ambiguous). Please address the changes, and then as @leonardoalt mentioned, perform a rebase, and fix the coding style errors. The easiest way to check if you have any coding style errors is to run `./scripts/check_style.sh` locally.

Closing due to inactivity. @niko-renko if you feel like completing it in the future based on the change requests, please feel free to re-open.
