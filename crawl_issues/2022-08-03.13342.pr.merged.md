# [\#13342 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13342) `merged`: Add full stops to error messages

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4415530?u=dc3db70e8fbd03f92ca81ee173d57774ce61084d&v=4" width="50">[nikola-matic](https://github.com/nikola-matic) opened issue at [2022-08-03 09:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13342):

This change moves the addition of full stops (periods, dots) from  #12362. So far, full stops were added to 4907, 9767, 7366 and 2271.

@chriseth error 7366 also doesn't contain a full stop, however, this was not touched in your and @wechman 's PR. Should I update that one as well?

I'd say yes!

Additionally, I'm actually wondering, if we should also generally make the error messages proper full sentences... i.e. for these that would mean  changing it to "Operator ... **is** not..." - any other opinions on that? Also fine with keeping that as is myself.

I'll update the full stops for 7366 as well. As far as proper full sentences are concerned, most compilers tend to be quite terse (our current style), so this could perhaps be a discussion for another time? Although if @chriseth and yourself think it might improve things, I wouldn't mind implementing it.
