# [\#13343 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13343) `closed`: update clang-format as it should now support all styles required

### Checklist

* [x] update .clang-format
* [x] adapt CI to verify style by using clang-format (requires version 14 or above, Ubuntu 20.04 seems to have it)
* [x] update source files

I found a static built of clang-format [here](https://github.com/muttleyxd/clang-tools-static-binaries/releases).
clang-format file documentation is [here](https://releases.llvm.org/14.0.0/tools/clang/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html).

### Open question: broken up if-conditions

```cpp
if (
    overlyLongExpression
)
    then();
````

I could not find an equivalent of this in the clang-format documentation. Dangling closing `)` is definitely for other parts, but here I am uncertain.

### Conditionally breaking the rules

It is possible to break the clang-format defined style by surrounding the lines with `// clang-format off` and a `// clang-format on` comment. 
Because it is not clear to me if we want to update the sources respectively or what parts to force as-is (that need the comments as mentioned above), I did not update the sources yet. For sake of reviewing, I could add such a commit applying .clang-format on them.

Changing to ``AlignOperands: Align`` is *still* wrong...
