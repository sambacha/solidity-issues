Needs rebase on latest `develop` to have the OZ test pass. And the chainlink one looks just like a transient networking error.

This looks good now, but from the looks of it you *merged* develop instead of rebasing it :-).
If you can rebase it with ``git rebase -i develop`` and simultaneously "squash" the changes into a single commit, then we can merge (otherwise we can also take care of the rebase).

Damn it, something went wrong here now...

I tried to rebase this against the fork (which usually works), but apparently I lost the changes while doing so, I'm very sorry about that...

@angusjoshi1 Do you happen to still have the changes locally? If so you can just push them again using ``git push -f`` and we can take it from there. Again sorry about my git accident here :-).
