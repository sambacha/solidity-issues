ABI coder V2 is now enabled by default. It allows us to do the following:
- Multidimensional arrays (including dynamic arrays) can be used as input for external functions.
- Multidimensional arrays (including dynamic arrays) and structs can be used as return values for external functions.

I changed the documentation based on this. (I have already experimented on my machine to make sure it works.)

However, `mapping` is not allowed as a return value before, so I left it as it is.

EDIT: I am not aware whether all multidimensional arrays of all value types are supported by ABI coder V2.

The failing OpenZeppelin test is already fixed on latest `develop`. I rebased the PR and pushed to the original branch to make it pass so that we can merge this.

I also added some more tweaks while at it:
- Expanded the note according to @ekpyron's comment but with even more detail
- Removed another mention of v2 not being the default
- Added more consistent index entries for pragmas.

@minaminao Please check if you're fine with these changes.

Looks good. It's helpful to clearly understand the specifications.
