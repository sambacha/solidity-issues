# [\#13352 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13352) `closed`: Avoid copying unused returndata on .call family of functions
**Labels**: `optimizer`

For some reason I thought this had been fixed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12684 but it doesn't seem to be the case...

When the return data of a call is not stored in a variable (or more generally, when it's not used), it shouldn't be copied to memory. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12647 for a discussion on why this is important.

The snippet below emits `returndatacopy` for the entirety of the returndata size.
```solidity
(book ok, ) = target.call();
```

++ we just encountered this today in our 0xMonaco ctf.

the compiler also shouldn't copy unused returndata for higher level calls too no? 

devs shouldn't have to use low level calls to avoid opening themselves up to major DoS footguns.

ah i believe this already covered by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12306?

For high level calls I think this was fixed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12684?
**Edit:** Maybe I misunderstood your comment. That PR fixed "unused returndata" in the sense of returndata past the size of the expected return type. But if a return value is not used it may still be copied (and decoded?). This is not a DoS vector though.

I hadn't seen #12306 but it looks like this issue is a duplicate of it.

Not necessarily for every contract, sure. But in some cases where you don't want a function to use beyond a certain gas limit it can be.

Closing as duplicate of #12306
