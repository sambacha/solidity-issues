# [\#13360 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13360) `merged`: `update_bugs_by_version.py`: don't fail when the list gets updated

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-08-08 15:29](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13360):

The script fails if the file gets updated, which is fine for testing but confusing when you run it manually. I changed the script so that the diffing happens only in CLI tests.

Also, refactored the script to use pathlib.
