Some tweaks to the checklist based on our experience with this release.
- Docs get built automatically so looks like we no longer need separate steps for RTD. We should verify that with @chriseth though.
- In practice we never run full `tests.sh`. I updated that point to say only to run the buglist update script.
- Clarification regarding changelog and version commits.
- Warning on the release page and more detailed steps for blog posts.

I just merged https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13370, so would be nice to tweak the checklist for that here as well.
