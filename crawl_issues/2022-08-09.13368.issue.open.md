First step in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13323.

Targetting the breaking branch, we should make ``code`` a proper keyword and allow its use as a data location.

A first step would then just disallowing any declaration in which ``code`` actually occurs as data location a syntax error (i.e. "not yet supported").

As a side-remark: once this is done, we could have a breaking release any time and implement the rest of the ``code`` data location non-breakingly.

When closing this issue, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13369 should be moved to the ``Design/Decide`` column of the Focus Board.

Since we realized that address types have a ``.code`` member, this gets slightly more complicated.

In the call today, we decided to still keep both the address member and the data location called ``code`` for now. But that means that we need a parser hack during parsing member accesses:

In fact there is also such a parser hack in place for parsing the ``.address`` member.

In ``Parser::expectIdentifierTokenOrAddress``, we just need to do the same for ``Token::Code`` as we do for ``Token::Address``.

Please review their action plans below:


**1) [theosch](https://gitcoin.co/theosch) has been approved to start work.**

The plan is simple: 1) Learn where the data locations are parsed; 2) Make the `code` keyword be recognized and processed like it's requirefd (i.e. report a "not yet supported" error); that's all. As there is a lot of extra information in the discussion at GitHub, it's going to take a few hours only.
Thanks

I believe there is probably significant work already done here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13468, including the hack mentioned by @ekpyron üßêü§î :

Yes, this issue is actively being worked on by the core compiler team - so it's not a particularly good choice for an external gitcoin grant...

Didn't notice that I'm approved hours ago, the email notification was late; So can I try to make it? I think I can make it by tomorrow.

As I was trying to say: there is nothing to take here - the change will be handled by the core team and is already in progress.
The gitcoin grant here is not coming from the compiler team, so I can't approve or disapprove anything, but there is little point in working on this, resp. creating a new PR on it.
