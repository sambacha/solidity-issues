Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13368.
As a second step of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13323, we properly type check the new ``code`` data location.

This entails removing the syntax error introduced in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13368 and instead implementing the type checker logic for the ``code`` data location.

This will mostly involve conscious copying of the behaviour of the ``calldata`` location in runtime context and of the ``memory`` location in creation context. Since ``code`` variables behave differently depending on creation vs runtime context, this will require some refactoring of the type checking logic (may overlap with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13365).

This should be accompanied by extensive syntax tests that demonstrate the type checking behaviour.

Finally, in code generation, any attempt to generate code for a ``code`` variable should result in an ``solUnimplementedAssert`` to be eliminated in subsequent steps.

Similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13368, this is not a good issue to be worked on with an external grant. @NatalieTop, did you open this gitcoin grant as well? It's very much appreciated that you're trying to help with the compiler development this way, but it would work much better, if we coordinated this a bit better up front :-).

For example, you could reach out to us via [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity-dev:gitter.im) or [gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev) to confirm before opening gitcoin grants.
