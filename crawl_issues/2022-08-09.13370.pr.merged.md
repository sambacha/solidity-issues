As for the checklist, yeah, we should update it but it would be best to merge #13363 first.

It's waiting for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13363, since it'll require to change the release checklist as well (just doesn't do that right away, since it'd only result in conflicts anyways).

That being said, since https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13363 is not merged yet and this can be, we can merge here and adjust there.
