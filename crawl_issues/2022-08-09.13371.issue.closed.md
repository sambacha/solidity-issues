## Page

The Address.transfer function may not be compatible with smart contract recipients due to gas limits.

Since smart contract recipients are first-class citizens on Ethereum we should either:

1. Stop recommend `.transfer` everywhere (in documentation) and deprecate the function, or
1. Clearly explain the limitations of `.transfer` everywhere it is mentioned (in documentation) and explain the difference of `.call("")` inline.

## Discussion

I wanted to discuss this to get approval before offering any specific changes.

I think we should clearly indicate the differences.  The function`<address>.transfer` is quite convenient and I wouldn't entirely remove it from the docs or deprecate it. The notion of `callstipend` is well-defined in the Yellowpaper and the EVM. It provides enough gas to receive the ETH and emit an event, and cannot modify state. Even when storage / opcodes gets repriced, some care is made to ensure that most contracts will continue working (see how EIP-2929 introduced access lists).

The replacement`.call{value: ...}("")` adds a re-entrancy risk and solving it will cost ~3000 gas assuming full refunds. The applications that `.call{value: ...}("")` allow, i.e., complex smart contract wallets, forwarding patterns etc haven't really caught up. As a comparison, standards such as ERC-777, ERC-1155 and ERC-721's hooks are largely ignored by most protocols as they increase security risks. 

Also, do you have an example of a smart contract wallet that breaks on `.transfer`? (Assuming access lists can be used.)

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
