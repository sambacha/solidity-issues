The solidity docs and [Inline assembly memory management](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.15/assembly.html#memory-management) suggest the actual allocate-able memory starts from `0x80`, defaulting the free memory pointer to `0x80`. 

But the above yul example defaults the free memory pointer to `0x60` in initialisation cases which I'm not sure if it's intended.

I think this deviation may actually be intentional. The documentation of Yul objects describes *in general* how yul objects can be written, not what kind of Yul objects you can expect to be generated from Solidity code - and a pure Yul contract is in no way beholden to the Solidity memory layout. In that sense we could also have used ``0x20`` as offset *for* the free memory pointer here...

That being said, it may be right that this is more confusing than helpful, at least without saying something about it explicitly and I'm not sure that'd be overly beneficial and helpful...

But yeah, in general this section of the documentation is decidedly *not* about inline assembly Yul, but about full Yul objects.
