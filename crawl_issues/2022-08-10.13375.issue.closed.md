# [\#13375 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13375) `closed`: Different gas cost when using Libraries with using and without

Hi, I stumbled across this while optimizing my contracts.
I do not know if this is maybe and hardhat-gas-reporter bug because in my opinion both options should lead to the same byte code.
UQ144x112 is just a library for unsigned fixed decimal it does not matter what kind of library is used.
```
contract Test
{
   using UQ144x112 for uint256;

   function test1() returns (uint256)
   {
      uint112 res1 = 1000;
      uint112 res2 = 2000;
      unchecked
      {
          return UQ144x112.encode(res1).uqdiv(res2);
      }
   }

    function test2() returns (uint256)
   {
      uint112 res1 = 1000;
      uint112 res2 = 2000;
      unchecked
      {
          return UQ144x112.uqdiv(UQ144x112.encode(res1),res2);
      }
   }
```
I hope there is now error but I just put it together instead of copying the whole contract.
If I run the tests with gas report enabled `test1()` uses 5 gwei more gas than `test2()` which I do find odd.

It's likely the order of the function in the dispatch affecting the gas. See: https://hrkrshnn.com/t/devconnect.pdf#page=11 for some details.

You can easily verify this by swapping the names of the functions and seeing the difference. Let us know if that is indeed the case. Closing this.

@hrkrshnn I used 5 different libraries and even switched names as suggested. The result is always the same. 
The call without making use of using is slightly cheaper than the other one.

If you switched the names and noticed no difference, that's really odd. Note: I'm referring to switching the names of `test1` and `test2`.
