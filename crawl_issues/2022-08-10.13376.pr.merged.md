**Labels**: `optimizer`

Allows usage of colon `:` delimiter in the optimizer sequence to specify optimization steps (before delimiter), and clean up steps (after delimiter). Addresses #9627.

@ekpyron Nice, I remember there was some mentioned of JSON, but I forgot to ask. Will fix.

@ekpyron , regarding the testing suggestion: I generally do agree with the sentiment, but this should probably be done as part of a separate issue since it would require fiddling around with all of the `yul_optimizer_steps*` tests, as all of them just use an empty contract as input
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.0;

contract C
{
	function f() public pure {}
}
```
In fact, the vast majority of the cmdline tests that cover optimization sequence(s) are there mostly to verify the parsing of the sequence, and not so much to test the actual behaviour of the compiler when using a specific sequence; having said that, the tests did catch a bug of mine early on because the bytecode output didn't match, so I guess they're not that bad :)

Ehm... no :-D?

Obviously, the tests should make it apparent that the added feature actually works, and the current ones do not. The preexisting optimizer step tests do that as well (note for example that ``yul_optimizer_steps`` specifically does not contain the inliner, but does contain the unused pruner, so if you know what to look for, the test makes it apparent on first sight that the functionality works).

So stop being lazy and add the proper tests ;-P!

Well, there's my problem :D. Alright, I'll change the tests, and ping back if I have some questions.

Needs rebase.

@ekpyron do you still wanna wait for @cameel here or should we merge?

Ah wait, the changelog thing is actually important. But I see it conflicts so the PR can't get merged without fixing that anyway :)
