# [\#13378 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13378) `merged`: unchecked increment for simple counter for loops

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2022-08-10 14:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13378):

I'm not saying we should do things this way. Not at all. But we said we explore all our options and want a PR draft, so here is a very minimal version.

Implements a reduced version of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13308, restricted to for loop conditions and loop post expressions specifically only. (which gets around having to analyze control flow entirely compared to the general case)

If we decide to actually pursue this approach, we'd, of course, need extensive unit testing on this.
Might also even make sense to export the annotation in the JSON AST to give confirmation that the optimization kicked in and as an easy indicator if this were to turn out buggy.

Our test suite are of course a gross misrepresentation of the effects of this, but still :-):

Keeping in mind that those results are not indicative of anything, since we never manually gas-optimized our tests for this issue.

External test benchmarks are of course much less impressive, since in real-world code people do work around this issue. However, surprisingly, it does still have *some* effect:

`!T` = one or both values were not numeric and could not be compared
`-0` = very small negative value rounded to zero

But yeah, the goal here isn't actually saving gas directly, but rather allowing more readable code to be equally gas-efficient as hand-optimized ugly code.

The gas reports on the external tests (i.e. hardhat's gas reports) are not 100% reliable, so very small changes < 0.05% may due to some non-deterministic factors. Apart from that, it seems to be a slight code size increase on occasion - there it might be that the change tipped the scales on the inlining heuristics in some cases. Might be worth a deeper look into, though, if we pursue this approach further.

Adding the ``takeover`` label here, since I'm not sure when I'll find the time to get back to this myself.

The main thing missing here is a solution for testing this and similar future optimizations.

All of the properties resulting from the analysis of Solidity should, like here, end up in the AST, so technically our AST tests should do the trick - but they're too huge and unfocused for this purpose, so what needs to be done here is to define a nice way to test for specific AST properties and annotations in ``isoltest``.

Not stale, just still waiting for someone to finish it.

Yeah, I had already un-staled it - I'll try to expedite finding someone to  finish it (it's mainly blocked by requiring more and better testing, which warrants some new testing infrastructure, since we'll likely do more optimizations like this in the future) - or otherwise try to find the time to finish it myself.

@ekpyron Thank you. Maybe there is a cheat we can use to get this done with existing test tools. I assume the thing you are requiring is gas testing.

For example, with the existing `.call` syntax we can specify an amount of gas. And we can hard code in an expected amount of gas for the naive implementation (`for...`) and the deprecated over optimization (`for ... unchecked{...}`).

For some gas number both the naive and the deprecated should fail for out of gas. And for that number minus one, both should succeed.

The issue is not gas tests, but tests for semantic correctness, i.e. tests ensuring that here exactly those loops that qualify get annotated as "simple counter loops", in general, that only the correct AST patterns get annotated. We need a good way to test these kinds of annotations, since we'll add more similar optimizations over time.

It is possible to test this by making executing this optimization against all test suites and expecting NO CHANGE. Then manually reviewing and switching to CHANGE EXPECTED for the ones that are correct?

This means that as new tests are added the test suite will fail if they reach a situation where this optimization would change that.

There are 2 things currently missing:
- Handing down the optimize flag
- Lacks testing that checks single properties of the AST
  - Solidity code+Insert NatSpec comments (JSON path to the subfield name:subfield) on which the sub-property started (test expectations name:valueOfthefield)

Quick hint: for rebasing this, it'll be easiest to just drop the gas changes in the tests and just regenerating them with isoltest.

The new kind of tests should roughly look like this:

```
contract C {
  function f() public pure {
     /// TestCase1: isSimpleCounterLoop
     for(uint i = 0; i < 42; ++i) {
     }
     /// TestCase2: isSimpleCounterLoop
     for(uint i = 1; i < 42; i = i * 2) {
     }
  }
}
/// TestCase1: true
/// TestCase2: false
```
However, feel free to adjust the design as you see fit when writing it, if a slightly different version makes this easier.
It should be possible for these tests to solely act on the JSON AST.

I found some problems that look serious if left as is (one likely allows to bypass the check against modifying the counter in loop body), but they're all straightforward to fix, so I don't think that'll affect the release timing.
