Mostly because I lack the context, the "valid values" of the last two are not clear for me. 

For signed integers what is word referring to? 2 bytes or 2x256 bits? 

For unsigned isn't it actually "left-padding" rather than masking? my understanding is for example the number `01010` will be `00000....00001010` in 256 bits.

Ok, maybe we should rewrite this even more aggressively :-).

All values "live" in 256-bit types anyways (ultimately on the EVM level everything is 256-bits wide), so there is no "left-padding", but rather masking, i.e. the value already has higher-order bits, they are just set to zero.

But just to make absolutely clear that we're on the same page:

What the valid values are depends on the size of the type - so at the example of signed and unsigned 8-bit types:

Signed 8-bit Integers (``int8``)
---------------------------------------
For an 8-bit signed integer for example, the valid values are:

positive:
```
0000...0000 0000 0000
0000...0000 0000 0001
0000...0000 0000 0010
....
0000...0000 0111 1111
```
or negative:
```
1111...1111 1111 1111
1111...1111 1111 1110
....
1111...1111 1000 0000
```

Cleanup just means setting all the (256-8) higher (i.e. left) bits to the sign bit, i.e. the 8th bit from the right.

So the following are examples of invalid signed 8-bit integer values and the results of their cleanup:

Positive cases:
```
invalid value: 1111...1111 0000 0000
sign bit: 0
cleaned value: 0000...0000 0000 0000
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 0000 0000
sign bit: 0
cleaned value: 0000...0000 0000 0000
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 0001 0110
sign bit: 0
cleaned value: 0000...0000 0001 0110
```

Negative cases:
```
invalid value: 0000...0000 1111 1111
sign bit: 1
cleaned value: 1111...1111 1111 1111
```


```
invalid value: 0101...1101 1111 1111
sign bit: 1
cleaned value: 1111...1111 1111 1111
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 1001 1111
sign bit: 1
cleaned value: 1111...1111 1001 1111
```

Unsigned 8-bit Integers (``uint8``)
--------------------------------------------
For an 8-bit unsigned integer for example, the valid values are:

```
0000...0000 0000 0000
0000...0000 0000 0001
0000...0000 0000 0010
....
0000...0000 1111 1111
```

Cleanup just plainly means setting all the (256-8) higher (i.e.) left bits to zero (or equivalently: masking with ``0000...0000 1111 1111``).

So for example:

```
invalid value: 1111...1111 0000 0000
cleaned value: 0000...0000 0000 0000
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 0000 0000
cleaned value: 0000...0000 0000 0000
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 0001 0110
cleaned value: 0000...0000 0001 0110
```

```
invalid value: 0000...0001 1111 1111
cleaned value: 0000...0000 1111 1111
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 1111 1111
cleaned value: 0000...0000 1111 1111
```

```
invalid value: 0101...1101 1001 1111
cleaned value: 0000...0000 1001 1111
```



So I hope this ultimately clarifies, what the docs are **supposed** to say here :-).
If that's right, we can think about how to best phrase this, s.t. it actually makes that understandable :-).

So in the 8-bit signed integer case, in ``sign-extended word``, ``word`` refers to the actually relevant 8 bits, i.e. the right-most 8 bits - if you consider those and sign-extend them to 256-bits you get all the valid 8-bit values embedded into 256-bits.

> All values "live" in 256-bit types anyways

This was the key and the examples given made it crystal clear, thanks!

In case of word, I'd consider changing the "word" (pun unintended) if it is not a used term in EVM or Solidity. I think something explicit like "sign-extended 256 bit number" is more clear.

Decide how best to rephrase or whether to just merge :-). To be fair, this is just 3 days old, though ;-).

You can also just approve it and we merge it :-D. It's an improvement already, isn't it?

To me, a layman, this comment does a better job of explaining variable cleanup than the contents of the docs :laughing: Perhaps adding a couple of example of signed and unsigned cleanup would make sense?

I'd suggest also to improve the section initial line from:
```
When a value is shorter than 256 bit, in some cases the remaining bits must be cleaned. 
```
to:
```
Ultimately, all values in the EVM are stored in 256 bit words. Thus, when the type of a value has less than 256 bits, in some cases the remaining bits must be cleaned.
```

I took over @matheusaaguiar's suggestions.

I think that a small example might help people visualize what cleanup does. For me it's well explained, but I would say I'm a little biased because I worked with this in the recent overflow checks PR. So, it would be nice to have other opinions.
