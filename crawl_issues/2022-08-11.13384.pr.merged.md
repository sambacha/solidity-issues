Closes #11407

- Allows providing an optional name/identifier just after the key type and the value type.
- Identifier defaults to empty string "".
- The optional identifier if provided is set to the "name" field in JSON ABI.
- Test cases are added for parser and ABI generator

Please let me know of any changes that are needed.

Can you add a semantic test as well? https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/getters/mapping.sol here is an example

Could you also add an example in the documentation?

Thanks for the review! I've made the changes.

> function call options syntax for mappings

This might be tricky for nested mappings: `allowances[{owner: 0xAddr}][{spender: 0xAddr}]`. Somehow having it together could be good `allowances[{owner: 0xAddr, spender: 0xAddr}]`, however the names are optional hence this together syntax might not work. But yeah having it makes sense for improving code readability, does not affect any ABI or bytecode. I'd prefer adding it in a separate PR unless it is needed in this PR.

> Additionally to the comments, I am wondering if it makes sense to make it an `optional<ASTPointer<ASTString>>`.

Depends if we prefer to treat it as a missing name or an empty name. That will show up in the AST.

But overall `optional` would make it clearer that this is even possible. And since names need to be unique, having to treat `""` as an exception is not that great.

Also, I can't see any place in the AST where we'd have a single optional name but in a few cases we do have vectors of names and that's closer to `optional` than to having an empty string when the name is missing.

I have rebased over the latest `develop` branch to fix the conflicts.

Also, a fun test case would be the following
```solidity
type name is uint256;
contract C {
    mapping (name name => uint) public names;
}
```

The corresponding auto-generated function `function names(name name) returns (uint);` The compiler would complain that `Name has to refer to a struct, enum or contract.` which is a bit misleading.

Another example is
```solidity
mapping (uint x => uint x) public something;
```

The equivalent function would be `function f(uint x) returns (uint x)` which wouldn't compile because the name is defined twice in the same context.

I think we need to do some additional sanity checks on the names defined in this way. I think we should do this before merging it. @zemse do you feel like adding this in the implementation?

Heya @zemse, I've rebased against latest upstream develop to get the build in working order. Are you still interested in working on this PR, or should we have someone else takeover? Also, for future reference, please create a separate branch in your fork for features instead of working directly on `develop`.

> it seems like you don't want to allow named nested mappings

```solidity
mapping(uint hello => mapping(uint world => uint whats) up) guys;

// getter for above mapping
function guys(uint hello, uint world) public returns (uint whats);
```

As you can see the mapping name "up" is not used at all. Since it means nothing, still allowing that code to be compiled will mislead people into expecting it to work. 

> since this would then require a specific rule to handle nested mappings?

If adding grammar for this case is complex then it makes sense to remove this requirement, since it's not really a big deal ig. And actually Hari helped me with the grammar previously, I added this check for named nested mappings after his help while adding additional test cases and was not aware I have to fix the language grammar as well (I'm not familiar with that, will need to figure it out). 

> I'll add it to our agenda for the next language design meeting

Thanks! I've added the call to my calendar.

> Are you still interested in working on this PR, or should we have someone else takeover? 

I am up for working on fixing minor issues in the PR. But if it's faster through someone from the solidity team, then we should do that probably. Specifically for the language grammar fix (due to the named nested mapping names), it would be great if I get some help.

> Also, for future reference, please create a separate branch in your fork for features instead of working directly on develop.

Sure, sorry about directly using the develop branch on my fork. Is there a way to change the fork's branch in this same PR? I think I will have to close this PR and create a new PR but that would lose the discussions in this thread. If that is okay, I can do it. And for future things, I'll make sure to not use default branches on fork.

I'm far from an expert so someone else will from the team will have to chime in.

Yup, looks like it. The only question I have is whether it's 'used', or rather, whether it shows up in the ABI/AST or not? The answer to this question will essentially dictate whether we alter the grammar, or the code.

I'm sure this won't be a problem either way, it's just a matter of making a decision. We can discuss this on Wednesday.

Awesome - as long as you're responsive, it's not really a big deal. The only reason I asked was because the PR has been inactive for quite some time. Whatever decision we make, I'm guessing it won't require a lot of work; we'll help out with whatever you need.

No need to do anything regarding this now, I just mentioned it for future reference in case you decide to continue contributing.

Just randomly throwing in some important test cases we need to cover:
 - named mapping parameters for storage pointers of mapping types as local variables (and function parameters)
 - named mapping parameters for state variables of function type that takes a mapping as parameter
 - what about mappings as struct members?

Not saying anything about this should or should not work, but we should certainly have tests for these.

As suggested by @ekpyron in the language design meeting:
1. We should allow naming keys and values in nested mappings as well. Also it should be possible to name the value even when it’s a mapping or an array.
2. More tests

Summary of the changes done:
1. Removed the commit ee0fee7f7613f45439143e42b37ed84ff6236a7b that disallowed param for mapping value types.
2. Added more tests in 4aedd7755ce215995cae080f644fb984f22e4522.
3. Rebased over upstream/develop branch. (For comparison of changes before & after the force push, I've pushed [backup branch](https://github.com/zemse/solidity/commits/develop-backup-19-nov))

I've pushed an empty commit, squash and pushed in the hopes of restarting the build successfully, but unfortunately we seem to have CI problems, which will hopefully be resolved soon. In fact, as soon as that happens, I'll restart the build to see whether everything passes, and then I'll resume reviewing.
