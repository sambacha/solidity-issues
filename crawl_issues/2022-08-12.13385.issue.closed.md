Basically recreate https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12707 as an archlinux build (resp. re-evaluate if we still need to make it an ``arch`` build for newer ``cmake`` or an ubuntu build run would also be just fine).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
