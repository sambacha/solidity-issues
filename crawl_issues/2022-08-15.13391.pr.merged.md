closes #13199

For some reason, event's Natspec is inherited in userdoc but not devdoc. Not sure if it's on purpose.

Thanks for the PR! The fix might be a bit more complex than that though, and may need to take into account annotations and conflicting parents.

@leonardoalt I believe such conflict resolution is already implemented when I went through the code. Such inheritance has already been done for `events` in `userdoc`. I think the reason why `userdoc` and `devdoc` differs on `events` is because of this one line which might be an oversight.

@axic I tried to override events but it seems like this is not allowed. Also inheriting two events with the same signature, each from a separate base contract, is not allowed.

I don't know if there's any other test cases I should include.

@axic I accidentally uploaded a bunch of cache files and now I think the CI jobs are frozen

@christianparpart can you take a look at this PR, it's seems like this is your niche :)

@timweri can you please rebase against the latest upstream develop - some of the old jobs are failing.
@christianparpart another look pls, I think this one is close to being done (if not already).

@timweri we've finally fixed our builds, so can you please rebase against upstream develop again?
