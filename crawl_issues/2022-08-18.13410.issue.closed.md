Referenced in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13162#discussion_r939153742  .

At the moment, the compiler as several Error types ( for eg. Exception, Internal compiler error, Compiler Error ) that seem to be redundant. 

The task here is to decide which of the error types can be removed and refactor the code accordingly.

The issue gets much easier to resolve once https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13162 is merged. Error::Type has been expanded.

The Error types are listed in an enum at 
`class Error: virtual public util::Exception` in `liblangutil/Exceptions.h`

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
