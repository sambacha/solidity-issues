@matheusaaguiar once you're done with the tweaks I suggested, you could try the next point from the list in my PR: `Disallow suffixes with storage and calldata return values.`

I pulled the first 3 commits into the base PR. Please rebase the remaining 2. I squashed some older fixups but the code did not change (yet) so just keeping the top 2 commits should let you avoid conflicts.

I pushed some changes yesterday to the base branch - they added proper support for strings in IR codegen so that semantic tests now pass. I also added some new semantic tests. Please rebase on the new state of my branch.

Also, since I'm off now - maybe in the meantime you could also add a fix for `decimal_decomposition.sol` in your branch? I think I must have just forgotten the abi coder pragma.

I don't get any errors in that test... should  `pragma abicoder v2;` be added?

There are errors in CI. See one of the `soltest_all` jobs. It didn't fail for me locally either but that's because by default soltest runs with abicoder v2. You have to give it the `--abiencoderv1` option to run with v1. In CI we run it both ways.

Some tweaks needed but overall looks good. I'll pull it into my branch when you apply them.

But you can already start working on some later points from the checklist. I updated the PR description above - choose one of those I added.

I pulled the "Disallow suffixes with storage and calldata return values" part into the base PR. I'm still reviewing the rest of the PR.

> - [ ] Include suffix definition as a secondary location in errors.

Some hints on this since I just had to do this in the operators PR. To add a secondary location, you simply put an instance of `SecondarySourceLocation` into the third argument of helpers like `m_errorReporter.typeError()`. Here's an example from operators:

```c++
m_errorReporter.typeError(
	1884_error,
	functionDefinition.parameterList().location(),
	SecondarySourceLocation().append(
		"Function was used to implement an operator here:",
		path->location()
	),
	fmt::format(
		"Wrong parameters in operator definition. "
		"The function \"{}\" needs to have {} to be used for the operator {}.",
		joinHumanReadable(path->path(), "."),
		wrongParametersMessage.value(),
		TokenTraits::friendlyName(*operator_)
	)
)
```

You can add multiple secondary locations with multiple `append()` calls. I do that for example when there are multiple definitions of an operator to show them all.

Note that secondary locations do not show up test expectations. You have to compile the file with `solc` to see them.

I rebased this together with the base PR. Both are now on top of the operators PR that is currently in review.

I'm pulling the commits for signed exponent check and array size check into the base branch.

Also, looks like the tests with huge exponent massively increase the running time of `soltest_all` (from 5 min to 30+ min). Given that it's very parallelized (has 50 parallel jobs), that's a bit too much. I'm disabling those tests for now in the base branch.

The syntax and type checking for suffix definitions is now done in the base branch. Now definitions need the `suffix` modifier. Some locations in error messages shifted due to this, which will likely cause conflicts when your rebase. Also note that I moved some of the type checks from `visit(Literal)` to `visit(FunctionDefinition)` because now we immediately know that a function is meant to be used as a suffix and we don't have to defer them until it's actually called.

> - [ ] Fix: Suffixes not detected as function calls by control flow graph (no "unreachable code" warning).

Here's a hint about how to tackle this point. It refers to the TODO note in `syntaxTests/controlFlow/unreachableCode/revert_in_literal_suffix.sol`:

```solidity
function suffix(uint) pure suffix returns (uint) {
    revert();
}

contract C {
    function f() public pure {
        1 suffix;
        uint a = 0; // TODO: Should warn about unreachable code here
        a;
    }
}
```

The suffix unconditionally reverts so anything after `1 suffix` is unreachable and should trigger a warning. This does not happen. I'm pretty sure it's because the suffix is not treated as a function call by the control flow graph. Please take a look at how the operators PR (#13790) handled this in `libsolidity/analysis/ControlFlowBuilder.cpp`. We need to do something similar.

Not sure what happened here, but this was supposed to be closed, not merged into the base branch.

Sorry about that. While trying to set `literal_suffix_functions` as the base branch for another PR, I must have done something wrong which resulted in this.
