We don't seem to have tests checking that the bytecode is fully reproducible based on metadata. Given how easy it is to break that (see e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13376#discussion_r950412127) I think we need some.

The biggest difficulty in testing this will be that the compiler does not directly take serialized metadata as input so we will have convert it to CLI options or StandardJSON manually (or add such a feature).

There are two ways we can implement such tests:
- As a new test case type. Each test would be a code snippets with CLI options or bits of Standard JSON input specified as soltest directives.
- As a new kind of command-line test.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
