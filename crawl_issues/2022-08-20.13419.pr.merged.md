There were many changes to the ECDSA library in OpenZeppelin's library and referenced functions are no longer safe to use in this manner since 4.1 version of the library.

In short - two versions of the functions which accept signature as `bytes` accept both 65-byte regular signature and 64-byte EIP-2098 signature.

It seems that this issue has been fixed in v4.7.3 released 10 days ago in OpenZeppelin's library, but the bug/feature was there for a long time and many people may be using outdated libraries. Should I change the wording to warn user about using older versions or just drop the PR altogether?

@rafales I've pushed the agreed upon changes do your fork's branch.
@leonardoalt I've removed some line breaks in order to conform with Kamil's suggestion, which is to try and keep a sentence on a single line as much as possible, in order to make reviews easier when future changes occur.
