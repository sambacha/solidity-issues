# [\#13420 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13420) `closed`: [Yul optimizer] Incorrectly removes partially overlapping memory writes
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
{
  calldatacopy(0x80, 0, 2)
  returndatacopy(0x80, 0, 1)
}
```

is optimized to

```
{
  returndatacopy(0x80, 0, 1)
}
```

To reproduce,

```
$ solc --strict-assembly --optimize test.yul
```

Edit: I think this is because the optimizer can decide to keep it that way since memory location `0x80` is never read. So it does not matter whether it contains the first byte of return data followed by the second byte of calldata or simply the first byte of return data.

Closing since this is not an issue.

~~I wonder if this is because lengths are rounded to nearest multiple of 32.~~

~~Somewhat reminiscent of: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11134/files#diff-6995800bf125c4119355e05a53a9f3b14f760a6f7be780568ac36f43776e96c3L389-R393~~
