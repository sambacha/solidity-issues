### What

enables client's of the lsp server to configure remappings during the initialisation command.

we already allow configuring import-paths through the initialisation, so hopefully this is not controversial.

the format expected to be passed in from the initialise json is:

```
{ 
  "remappings": [
      {context: "", prefix: "foo", target: "bar"},
      ...
  ]
}
```

### Why

Because without being able to set remappings, the lsp-server throws errors for any project that requires them.

Does this fix #12603? If so, please add `#Fixes #12603` in the PR description.

Also needs rebase on latest `develop` and approvals from @christianparpart and @leonardoalt.
