[`FunctionCallGraph`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/FunctionCallGraph.h) is currently [covered with boost tests](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/analysis/FunctionCallGraph.cpp). These tests are generally harder to maintain and update than our soltest-style tests.

We should define a custom test case class for them and put expectations in annotations. See [`StackLayoutGeneratorTest`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libyul/StackLayoutGeneratorTest.h) and [`test/libyul/yulStackLayout/`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libyul/yulStackLayout) for an example of such a custom test suite and test cases based on it.

### Example
We should be able to replace the following test case:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/a3de6cd60e4277051a1cc0f8eb8f1516e6c0ec57/test/libsolidity/analysis/FunctionCallGraph.cpp#L253-L292

with a `.sol` file that looks like this:
```solidity
function free() {}

library L {
    function ext() external {}
    function pub() public {}
    function inr() internal {}
    function prv() private {}
}

contract C {
    function ext() external {}
    function pub() public {}
    function inr() internal {}
    function prv() private {}
}
// ----
// CREATION
//     contract C
//     library L
// DEPLOYED
//     contract C
//         Entry -> function C.ext()
//         Entry -> function C.pub()
//     library L
//         Entry -> function L.ext()
//         Entry -> function L.pub()
```

Hi @cameel I'm new to Solidity but want to dig deeper into it. May I elaborate on this issue and provide an improvement? It takes some time and I will ask questions. Hope it won't be too bothering.

Hi @GeorgePlotnikov , maybe this issue is not really a good first issue for someone starting out, because it could demand understanding of how other test classes are implemented. I am not sure how long you are digging into solidity or how much time you are dedicating to it. So in order to give you more options, I'd like to suggest some other good first issues:
 - [Pretty print expected json output of command line tests](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7665)
 - [Errors reported for modifier overloading should outright say that overloading is not allowed](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12332)
 I just wanted to give you more options and remark that this is a medium size task, so if you are new, you might want a smaller one.

hi @matheusaaguiar thanks for clarifying. Let me consider these two before. If this one will be still orphaned I grab it.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
