**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

The error causing CI failures is the following:
```
he types returned by 'provider.getFeeData()' are incompatible between these types.
      Type 'Promise<import("/tmp/ext-test-Gnosis-Safe-hbDXur/ext/node_modules/ethers/node_modules/@ethersproject/abstract-provider/lib/index").FeeData>' is not assignable to type 'Promise<import("/tmp/ext-test-Gnosis-Safe-hbDXur/ext/node_modules/@ethersproject/abstract-provider/lib/index").FeeData>'.
        Property 'lastBaseFeePerGas' is missing in type 'import("/tmp/ext-test-Gnosis-Safe-hbDXur/ext/node_modules/ethers/node_modules/@ethersproject/abstract-provider/lib/index").FeeData' but required in type 'import("/tmp/ext-test-Gnosis-Safe-hbDXur/ext/node_modules/@ethersproject/abstract-provider/lib/index").FeeData'.
```
The issue is that `@ethersproject/abstract-provider` has recently introduces a new member of `FeeData`, which unfortunately causes incompatibilities as we end up having different version of said dependency.

Unfortunately, the regular approach where we would peg the version by explicitly installing the specific version of the package does not work, as the package in question is also a child dependency of another dependency. I have therefore manually specified the overrides (feature available from `npm v8.3+`) for packages in question by altering the project's (`safe-contracts`) `package.json` once the project is cloned, but before we run `npm install`.

I don't know whether this approach is appropriate, nor whether the appropriate version of `npm` is available in our CI, but it fixed the tests for me locally.

The `jq` command will add the following section to the project's `package.json`:
```json
  "overrides": {
    "@ethersproject/abstract-provider": "5.6.0",
    "@ethersproject/abstract-signer@5.6.0": {
      "@ethersproject/abstract-provider": "5.6.0"
    }
  }
  ```

@cameel, should be ready for merge, take a look when you can.
