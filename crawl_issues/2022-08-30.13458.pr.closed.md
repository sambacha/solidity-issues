Hmm there are a few CI failures that are fixed in `develop`, so we probably need to merge current `develop` into `breaking` after all.

This change is also affecting Yul. The following minimal example:
```
object "runtime" {
    code {

    }
}
```
compiled with `./solc --strict-assembly example.yul` will result in the error:
```Error: Expected keyword "code".```

I'm actually not quite sure how to react to this... did any of you actually read the issue?
The task is to add the keyword **and** to actually parse it as a data location, while making any use of the keyword a syntax error. As in an error in ``SyntaxChecker``.
While, technically, this PR is an initial step towards that, this by no means solves the issue.
Also the interactions with Yul should have become apparent with a single local CI run (the issue can be fixed by a minor adjustment of ``ObjectParser::parseCode``).

I also generally don't think it's beneficial to keep draft PRs in a state like this open. So please make sure you understand the scope of the underlying issue, if necessary ask for clarification on it, and reopen a proper PR actually addressing the issue.
