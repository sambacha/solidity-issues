I tried to check if every combination is added (or was already present) for each reference types tests. It is a bit difficult because some of the tests we already have don't all follow the same pattern. I am listing the cases which I think are missing and could complement those added in this PR:
 - Nested Arrays
   		Calldata -> Memory -- Already present
		Calldata -> Storage -- Already present
		Memory -> Memory -- Not found
		Memory -> Storage -- Already present
		Storage -> Memory -- Added
		Storage -> Storage -- Not found
- Elements of nested arrays
 		Calldata -> Memory -- Not found
		Calldata -> Storage -- Added
		Memory -> Memory -- Not found
		Memory -> Storage -- Added
		Storage -> Memory -- Not found
		Storage -> Storage -- Not found
- Nested Array of Structs
		Calldata -> Memory -- Not found
		Calldata -> Storage -- Added
		Memory -> Memory -- Not found
		Memory -> Storage -- Added
		Storage -> Memory -- Not found
		Storage -> Storage -- Not found
- Structs (Copy struct to struct)
	Calldata -> Memory -- Not found
	Calldata -> Storage -- Not found
	Memory -> Memory -- Not found
	Memory -> Storage -- Already present
	Storage -> Memory -- Already present
	Storage -> Storage -- Not found

Also, while looking at the already existing tests, I found `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/structs/copy_from_calldata.sol` but the file doesn't declare or use a struct, instead uses arrays...so maybe it was misplaced. Just noting this here, but maybe it should be dealt with separately, if it really is out of place.

@matheusaaguiar, thank you for your effort! To make further reviewing easier I extracted all cases you identified as missing to the list below. I think some of them are already covered. Please check my comments for those and let me know if you agree. Also I am going to deliver new test cases for the list items without comment .

* Nested Arrays
   `Memory -> Memory -- Not found` - Please take a look at [nested_array_element_memory_to_memory.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13464/files#diff-60dded291080c52e4c4f1fce418a9b9fe96cbbb9b347e7eeebd0bf82cd9056e0). I know the test name says array elements not the whole arrays. But, we operate on three-dimensional array elements there. That means, in fact, we are copying two dimensional arrays.
   `Storage -> Storage -- Not found` - Same as above, but test file is [nested_array_element_storage_to_storage.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13464/files#diff-a055204af272e6ccfe5a0e932b4e0db0483e38b6cccad6739580c9736a642138)
 * Elements of nested arrays
   `Calldata -> Memory -- Not found` - [nested_array_element_calldata_to_memory.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13464/files#diff-32a561650c15b7cb502a08f169d16a7f5db20119e278c157922c996883b8413e)
   `Memory -> Memory -- Not found` - [nested_array_element_memory_to_memory.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13464/files#diff-60dded291080c52e4c4f1fce418a9b9fe96cbbb9b347e7eeebd0bf82cd9056e0)

   `Storage -> Storage -- Not found`
 * Nested Array of Structs
   `Calldata -> Memory -- Not found`
   `Memory -> Memory -- Not found`
   `Storage -> Memory -- Not found` - [nested_array_of_structs_with_nested_array_from_storage_to_memory.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13464/files#diff-388ee9aca04923d8f0275b519a1bf57a0c3918ac1b4bcf0a2cc2ca7f05da1b7c)

   `Calldata -> Storage -- Not found`

@wechman Great! It was getting really overwhelming looking at a bunch of different tests, switching back and forth between existing and new ones, so I probably missed or mistakenly flagged some of those tests as not found.
I still didn't check the Mapping tests and will post my conclusions later.

@matheusaaguiar, here is the list of newly added tests:

I think, now we have covered all tests from the list you created.
