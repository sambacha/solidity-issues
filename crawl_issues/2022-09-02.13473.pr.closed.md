This fixes #13035. 

On Windows platform, it is much more likely to hit, as we did not URL decode the incoming URL, and thus, the files (nor the base path, if specified as `rootUri`) could not be opened nor traversed.

### Checklist

- [x] fix URL decoding/encoding
- [x] Changelog entry
- [x] tests

Actually, maybe also a windows-style path in the tests would be good
