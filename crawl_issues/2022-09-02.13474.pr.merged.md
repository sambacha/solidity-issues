By the way, did you check if the linking to the JSON input output works properly with `docs/docs.sh`? Otherwise, LGTM.

Yeah, checked it.
Rebased on develop now.

I guess it is not really needed, in this case. Although, I do prefer the merge is done by someone else rather than PR author.
Anyway, this is not urgent :)
