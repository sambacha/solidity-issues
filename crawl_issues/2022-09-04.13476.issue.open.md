# [\#13476 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13476) `open`: Hardhat compile w/ SMTChecker crashes with out-of-memory related issues on Ubuntu
**Labels**: `smt`, `needs investigation`

I am using hardhat and trying to run the SMTChecker. Normal compilation (sans checker) works fine, but a very simple contract (e.g., just `AccessControl`), will consistently cause a crash, apparently due to running out of memory (the particular error message varies, but I have seen the crash occur at the point that total system memory usage maxes out). This should repro on Ubunto 20.04 and 22.04.1, and on solidity 0.8.9 , 0.8.15, and 0.8.16, and with or without high system memory usage prior to compilation. The issue doesn't repro with a completely empty contract, but will repro when an empty contract imports `AccessControl`. `AccessControl` is a pretty fundamental tool, so I think the checker is hard to use for much if it crashes on even that. In one case, I tried to use the `contracts` setting to limit the checker to just the main contract, but this didn't work for my complex contract. I also tried turning off optimization for the dummy contract, but this didn't seem to help.

Follow up question - since SMTChecker isn't working, what _should_ i do?
There are an enormous number of verification options, and I'm having a hard time figuring out which is best.
Ideally, I'd like something pretty rigorous (or else I might as well just test) but also pretty easy to use.
Since I've already written a bunch of assertions targeting the SMTChecker, ideally I'd get some other system to check these assertions, perhaps w/ minor tweaks.
Thanks!

```

```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.9, 0.8.15, 0.8.16
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): IDK?
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): vim lol
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: IDK? just trying to compile w/ checks
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04.1

## Steps to Reproduce

Contract:
```
// Contract based on https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/erc1155
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

contract Ctr is AccessControl {
}
```

Hardhat config:
```
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
   solidity: {
     version: "0.8.9",
     settings: {
       optimizer: {
         enabled: true,
         runs: 1000
       },
       modelChecker: {
         engine: 'all',
       }
     }
   },
   networks: {
      hardhat: {},
   },
}
```
run `npx hardhat compile`

I have been trying to find a cutouts of my code that I can get this to work on, and what I've found is apparently that any contract which contains anything at all will crash the SMTChecker, and an empty contract will pass, though it'll pass quickly if it's by itself but it will take a really long time to pass if it's in the same file as an unrelated contract that isn't being targeted.

Hi @NeverFearTomorrow , thanks for opening the issue. I'll try to reproduce it locally and get back to you.
I'd say let's focus on latest solc to avoid old bugs. When you use 0.8.16, what z3 version are you using with it?

So while I was generally able to repro in 0.8.15/16 with my more complicated contract (the one I am actually developing), when I tried today with the dummy contract, it still repros in 0.8.9 but in 15/16 it complains that the Z3 and CVC4 solvers aren't available. I'm not really sure why I didn't see this complaint before - I'd think this warning would be front and center regardless what version of solc i'm using or what contract i'm targeting. I also don't recall the instructions saying we needed to install these, perhaps I skimmed the instructions too quickly and missed it, or perhaps i was reading instructions for 0.8.9.

i tried, essentially, `sudo apt install libz3-dev libz3-4` but that didn't seem to do any good.
