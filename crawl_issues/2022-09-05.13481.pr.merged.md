There was a new hardhat release a few days ago, and it seems they now pack their artifacts json more tightly, i.e.
`"param": "value"` -> `"param":"value"`.

And also disabled a couple of Zeppelin tests due to [#2453](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2453) (again).

`bleeps`, `gp2` and `yield_liquidator` will be addressed in subsequent PRs, as they're not required, and thus not blocking merging.

I guess this was meant to link to something else?

My bad, the issue is the hardhat repo. Fixed.
