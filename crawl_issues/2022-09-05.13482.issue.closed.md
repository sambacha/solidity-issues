# [\#13482 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13482) `closed`: Periodically post issues and PRs that require attention 
**Labels**: `low effort`, `medium impact`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

To keep response times low for new issues and PRs, I propose the following:

Every day, some automated mechanism (e.g. the webhook that gitter provides and that we are currently using to post CI results, or an actual proper matrix-bot (like [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) talking with github using the API) should post:

* all issues and PRs that have no label or comment at all
* all PRs that had no activity for more than 1 week

It could simply post all this in one message with bullet points, grouped by type, for example:

Issues requiring attention:
* `<link>`
* `<link>`
* `<link>`
* `<link>`

PRs requiring attention:
* `<link>`
* `<link>`
* `<link>`
* `<link>`


Further suggestion:

We could have a dedicated channel that simply posts github activity. I guess most of us receive github updates using either the notifications at the top or emails, but having all dev. related things in one place (the matrix client) makes it easier to manage. And as it is an extra channel, it's also optional or can at least be muted for the ones preferring other ways of notifications.

Advantages of having a dedicated bot would be that it could also auto-expand issue numbers to links in our channel

I think it might be best to post just a subset. E.g. 5 oldest + 5 latest. When we have a backlog, like now, we won't get through it in one go. It's periodic anyway so we'll go through it all eventually as long as it gets posted.

Not sure about this one. I'd rather have it on the main channel because it's meant to be not easily ignored. It should be annoying enough to make us do something but also not too spammy, which is why I'm suggesting posting only a subset.

For me a separate channel would still not replace the e-mails since I can't delete chat messages (or at least not without deleting them for everyone :)), mark them as done or categorize them like I can do with e-mails. And with the amount of notifications we have in the project, that's a must for me.

But I also would not be against having this channel in addition to posting a short digest to the main channel if others would find it useful.

That's a good one, I really miss that from gitter. I would consider that a separate issue though. It likely needs a different mechanism. Posting stuff to the channel is just a simple HTTP request we can do from CI. Filtering and post-processing messages on the other hand sounds like it would require an actual Matrix bot.

I meant additional, the summary should def. be in the main channel.
I can create an extra issue for the issue number expanding bot then

Removing `should have` label since it looks like we actually do not have a consensus on whether we want that and in what exact form.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
