As the headline says, simply a bot that listens for any pattern of `#<numbers>` and either edits the message if that is possible and replaces it with a link or post an additional message with the link.

Side node: Github doesn't differentiate between PRs/issues in links, so you could always use the pattern

`https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/<num>` and it will work, no matter if PR or issue.

Removing `should have` label since it looks like we actually do not have a consensus on whether we want that and in what exact form.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
