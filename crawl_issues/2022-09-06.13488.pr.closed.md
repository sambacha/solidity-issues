Consider adding a `cmdLineTest` or two, e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests/dup_opt_peephole. Ideally we would have two tests - one with, and one without peephole optimization, but peephole optimization can only be turned off via the JSON interface, as we have no command supported to do so via command line.

You'll also need to add an entry to `Changelog.md`.

By the way, thanks for contributing with this PR! Also, feel free to either re-run the failed jobs (the `ext_*`) or even better, rebase against fresh `develop` from time to time; these are external tests that were broken by the recent hardhat release, and we're actively fixing them, i.e. they're not failing because of your changes :)

One thing I noticed is that the equality is checked within an if condition is with `SUB` (since it expects 0 for `JUMPI`?), but if we simply do ` return a == true;` the equality here is checked with `EQ`. 

I guess that means we have to optimize for both these cases (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13488/commits/922be5b834cfd157b68ea740da34cb9bd595652f), or am I misunderstanding something here? 

Also, not sure if analysing unoptimzed code and then running this rule first is the correct approach to this. Would like some guidance on the same.

I you should look at the optimized code instead. Peephole optimizer is executed in `Assembly::optimiseInternal()` and it does not run just once: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b4b5f7b355d46e8f286926d9b0da613ecc7a09dc/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L342-L483

It's executed multiple times until the output stabilizes. Also, if any other optimizer step changes the output, the whole sequence is reexecuted.

In case of `--via-ir` we also run the Yul optimizer, which is a separate thing. It runs before EVM asm optimizer and may alter the input so if you look at the unoptimized output, you might be targetting a sequence that the peephole optimizer will not actually see :)

This was crucial, with that knowledge I've given it another shot. Still not sure if everything is entirely correct. Still learning how to decode opcodes :D

Also, thanks @cameel for leaving the very detailed explanations/reviews. They really helped.

@reubenr0d Are you still working on this ? Or shall we takeover

@nishant-sachdeva This was actually updated after my last review and is waiting for another review round from our side.

Now that we significantly trimmed our pile of PRs, I think I'll finally be able to get back to this after the Berlin on-site. But feel free to leave your review too.

Yes, that's correct. Still have to add tests, but wanted a quick review to make sure I'm on track. Keen on finishing this up :)

It would be nice to also have tests that show that the rules have the desired effect on gas usage. Furthermore, I think we should simplify some of them by moving at least part of the optimization to the RuleList.h. I commented in the original issue: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13442

We'd prefer doing this on the Yul level rather than in the peephole optimizer, so I'm closing the PR.
