As of LSP 3.17, the client and server can agree on a position encoding to use. We internally don't do anything special (yet), and certainly not UTF-16, so it should make sense for solc to simply advertise UTF-8 for position-encoding in the capabilities.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
