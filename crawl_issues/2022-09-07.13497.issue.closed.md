## Abstract

The `UnusedStoreEliminator` optimizer step is not listed in the documentation. Neither #12672 nor #12311 provided any docs for it.

When fixing, please also check if all the other [steps listed in `Suite.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp#L241-L287) are present in the docs.

@cameel 
As far as undocumented steps are concerned:
`ExpressionInliner` is not documented at all from what I can see.
`RedundantAssignEliminator` has been renamed to `UnusedAssignEliminator`, but the docs haven't been updated to reflect this.
Should this be done as part of this issue and perhaps #13501 (doesn't make sense to me), or this issue and separate PRs, or should a completely separate issue be opened?

Depends. If you'll be doing it yourself immediately (even if in a separate PR), opening new issues is not necessary. But if you want to leave it for later or have someone else do it, might make sense to open a new issue with proper title/description. Up to you I'd say.
