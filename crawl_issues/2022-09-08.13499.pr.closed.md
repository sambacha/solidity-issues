# [\#13499 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13499) `closed`: Add workflow to label and comment stale issues and PRs

This PR address some of the concerns of the issue https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8969.

It adds a workflow to label an issue or PR as stale after 30 days of inactivity, comments on them, and if they remain inactive for more 7 days it closes them. If an update occurs, the label is removed, and the timer restarted. The action can also be prevented by using the label `keep`.

It is currently set for debugging only, and can be trigger manually in the workflow dashboard, so we can check the expected behavior in the workflow logs without affecting the current open issues and PRs.

No, I tested in a private repo only with a few issues/PR (around 20).

We talked with @ekpyron about this PR today. Some preliminary decisions:
- We do want to do this for the PRs.
    - We'll exempt the `external contribution` label. These PRs often go unreviewed for some time and we don't want to drive away contributors because of that.
- For issues we don't want to enable it yet until we figure out how to exempt issues that already exist. Best if we can avoid having to put some label on all of them. Something based on creation date might be better.

We can ignore them by using the option [start-date](https://github.com/actions/stale#start-date). So only dates after the starting date will count (i.e. new issues/PRs).

I initially had opened the PR from my fork. Please consider PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13522 instead.
