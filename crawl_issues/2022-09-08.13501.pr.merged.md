@ekpyron can you remove the change request so some one else can take over the review, as I'd rather not have this sit around for another couple of weeks :)

You can just dismiss the review :)

But in any case, I'm now back from Berlin and catching up so I'm going to go back to this pretty soon.

Does it fix the issue completely?

I believe so, yes.

OK, changed to `Fixes #13497` to have github close it automatically.

> Tentatively approving, but please squash the review fixes and I still think the index entry would be better off pointing at the section that is about the keyword, not the whole page

My issue with this is that there's no uniformity regarding this in `optimizer.rst` if I make this change - our current top level `index::` doesn't have the vast majority of the optimizer steps in there anyway, and there's not a single usage of a `!` main entry topic either. I do agree that your suggestion would make things better, but only if applied to the whole document. I'm gonna squash the commits, and open a separate issue for this.
