We tried to make it a symlink in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/33 but back then we still served binaries via Github Pages and that does not support symlinks so we reverted the change in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/44. Now that we switched to AWS for hosting, we can revisit the idea.

Reopening, since this started actually causing issues now. Apparently the mechanism for updating `soljson-latest.js` broke and it hasn't been updated since 0.8.19 (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14676#issuecomment-1913728228). We updated the it manually to 0.8.27 now (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/155) but we can easily forget again so this needs a fix ASAP.
