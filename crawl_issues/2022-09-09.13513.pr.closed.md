Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13506.

The PR changes the current behavior of running the `build_emscripten` as root to be run as the current user. It, in turn, also fixes the git error when traversing files with different ownership without the need to change the default [safe.directory](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/) configuration.

It seems that the "recommended" way to fix the issue in the CI is indeed to add the directory as safe in the git config: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/cimg-base/issues/170#issuecomment-1134844852

So I added the option in the CI but kept the non-root configuration in the local build script to fix the permissions issues when building from the source.

Have you checked if the resulting ``soljson.js`` after running ``scripts/build_emscripten.sh`` and the ``soljson.js`` CI artifact of the ``b_ems`` build on the same commit are still binary-identical with these changes?

No, but I just did it now, and they differ :0
```
diff -q soljson.js soljson-ci.js 
Files soljson.js and soljson-ci.js differ
```

```
Local build                                                   CI

For reference: this is the issue for moving towards reproducible builds: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6228 - even though I thought it contained more helpful information on this :-). Previously https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7508 added the use of ``-fmacro-prefix-map`` with the hope that this'd catch most of the path dependencies, but apparently it didn't.

@r0qs Actually, before I'm sending you on a wild goose-chase with the reproducibility... it may just be that the CI builds will use a different version string (e.g. ``0.8.18-ci.*`` vs ``0.8.18-develop.*``) - which can manually be overridden by providing a ``prerelease.txt`` file. So might make sense to check the ``solcjs --version`` output of the CI version and only compare against a local version with a matching prerelease.txt file...

(I think in the past I mainly checked that builds are binary-identical on release builds that don't suffer from those version string mismatches)

Yeah, the binaries are still different in this build.

About the `prerelease.txt` file, the local `build_emscripten.sh` script calls the same build script used by the CI, which executes this line: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ci/build_emscripten.sh#L58 and set the `prerelease.txt` to `ci.2022.9.12`. So the solcjs version of both matches:
```
CI version: 0.8.18-ci.2022.9.12+commit.dc5d8f77.Emscripten.clang
Local version: 0.8.18-ci.2022.9.12+commit.dc5d8f77.Emscripten.clang
```

However, the binaries still differ in the first bytes:
```
Local build                                                   CI
return uncompress(base64DecToArr(source), uncompressedSize);}	return uncompress(base64DecToArr(source), uncompressedSize);}

20803149);var Module=typeof Module!="undefined"?Module:{};var |	20802489);var Module=typeof Module!="undefined"?Module:{};var
Module["wasmBinary"] = undefined;				Module["wasmBinary"] = undefined;
```

Yeah, ok, then it's probably easiest to just keep the build directories aligned between CI and the local docker builds (that way binaries *should* match). Although, eventually, we should try to figure out what exactly is still affected by the build directory.

Right, so I will create another PR for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13506, adding the `safe.directory` option and keeping the `/root/project`, until we figure out a solution. Should we close this PR? Because we still with the problem of local emscripten builds with wrong permissions.

Maybe we could use something like [rebuilderd](https://github.com/kpcyrd/rebuilderd) to monitor the reproducibility of our builds. The Archlinux distro uses it to verify if packages can be reproduced from the published source code: https://reproducible.archlinux.org/

Ah, nice! I didn't know that one. But yeah, might be worth looking into eventually - so far (as demonstrated by the issues we had here) our builds aren't *properly* reproducible, though, so I guess we should first get to a point in which this at least mostly works :-).

Actually, this wouldn't be fixed by this PR ever since https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13513#discussion_r966996860, would it? Hadn't thought about that, but it's true, I've been annoyed by those build directories ending up owned by root in the past... I guess there's no way to have proper user-id mapping in cases like this? (I.e. map ``emscripten:emscripten``, resp. 1000:1000 in the docker image to the current user outside docker?) That'd be ideal... but in any case, while that's annoying and we should try to fix it eventually, I'd not put it high up on our agenda.

In general, I hate it that those docker builds have to be run as root, but afaik there's no *easy* way around that :-).

> Actually, this wouldn't be fixed by this PR ever since [#13513 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13513#discussion_r966996860), would it?

Yes, it would fix the git repository error without setting the `safe.directory` option since both the CI and the local build would use the user id, 1000, so git would detect no permission changes. However, it would indeed cause other permission problems because it would depend on the id and gid of the current users. The build directory would not be created as root for local builds, but it would have the permissions of the user id 1000 in the host machine, whatever the user is.

And there is also the reproducibility build problem caused by changing the building path.

> I guess there's no way to have proper user-id mapping in cases like this?

Correct. I am also not aware of a proper fix for that. Even if we create a builder user in the docker images, the permissions in the host machine would still differ.
