## Abstract

Currently `abi.decode()` works with `memory` argument and not with `calldata`, if `calldata` is provided it is being copied to memory and then decoded. Let's make `abi.decode()` to support both arguments and returns as `calldata`.

## Motivation

`Calldata` abstraction is cool, slicing is cool. We need `abi.decode()` to fully support decoding from `calldata` to `calldata`!

## Specification

```solidity
function f(bytes calldata data) external {
    (
        address[] calldata targets,
        bytes[] calldata calldatas
    ) = abi.decode(data[1:], (address[], bytes[]));

    // ...
}
```

It could also add additional security because calldata is immutable, so no way to change data where it's not needed.

Just to clarify here: decoding *from* calldata (including slices) *does* work already (if it isn't for any case in which it should, let us know).
Encoding *to* calldata types is an interesting idea! So the expectation here would be that the ``abi.decode`` call validates the outermost tuple (reverting on invalid data) and returns the appropriate calldata references, basically as if they had been function arguments (only relative to the given ``bytes calldata`` instead of ``msg.data[4:]``)?

@ekpyron exactly. I assume implementing this feature would require reusing existing code of arguments decoding.

Currently, the return type of any function call is fully determined by the types of its arguments - so that'd be quite a step to break here (i.e. actually determine that the full ``abi.decode(...)`` expression is assigned to ``calldata`` types instead of ``memory`` types, and changing the semantics of the expression based on that).

However, I wonder if there are any issues with actually *always* having ``abi.decode`` return calldata types (if given a first argument in calldata), since they should be assignable to memory types as well (which would then trigger the full copy) - if that works, that might be worthwhile. The main issue then would be that it might still change the revert semantics of a plain ``abi.decode`` that *doesn't* use the return arguments...

So in general, the easiest solution to this would be to just change the return types of ``abi.decode`` with a calldata argument, to calldata types - that should directly solve this with near-zero effort - and I think this should all work now (there is a comment in the type checker code for ``abi.decode`` about the implementation of calldata types lacking and hence memory types being forced, but I think that's utterly outdated by now).

The problem with that approach, though, is that it's technically a breaking change :-).

@ekpyron I believe that we need to have 2 functions:
- `abi.decode(bytes memory, *)`
- `abi.decode(bytes calldata, *)`

As you said `calldata` argument version will return `calldata` types, which can be deep-copied to `memory` types. It doesn't look like a breaking change for me.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) commented at [2022-09-13 12:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13518#issuecomment-1245328421):

``abi.decode(bytes calldata, *)`` already exists, though, but so far is just an alias and returns memory types (and even if it didn't exist, since calldata to memory conversions are implicit effectively current code works *as if* it existed). And changing those return types to ``calldata`` types will change the revert semantics in certain corner cases. I'm saying it's *technically* breaking, since it's only weird cases that would actually change in behaviour, but strictly speaking it is.

So concretely:

```
contract C {
  function f() external {
    abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address[]));
  }
  function test() public returns (bool) {
    uint[] memory x = new uint[](1);
    x[0] = type(uint256).max;
    (bool y,) = address(this).call(abi.encodeWithSelector(this.f.selector, x));
    return y;
  }
}
```

Calling ``test()`` here will currently return ``false``, since ``abi.decode``, despite having a ``calldata`` argument, will directly copy-decode to ``memory``, which validates that the ``address`` elements don't have dirty higher order bits (but the single array element passed in has all bits set).

However, if we change the ``abi.decode(bytes calldata, *)`` version to returning ``calldata`` types, the ``abi.decode``-expression in ``f`` itself won't perform this validation just yet, so ``test()`` will return ``true``.

So yeah - it's the same valid code behaving differently due to changing this, making this at least technically breaking (even though it's a rather annoying technicality here...).

@ekpyron interesting, but why would you check high bits of addresses? I would say it is both unexpected from developer POV and non-desired, since it will spend gas, while function arguments decoder I assume skip these checks.

Calling ``function f(address x) external`` with dirty higher-order bits in ``calldata`` will also revert during argument decoding... Calling ``function f(address[] callata x) external`` will not *immediately* revert if called with an element with dirty higher order bits, but the first use e.g. ``x[0]`` will revert, if there are dirty higher-order bits.
Validation like that has been happening ever since ABIEncoderV2.
There's some corner cases when copying from calldata to memory in legacy code generation that *won't* perform this validation, which is actually underdocumented currently, but in general, there will be input validation.

Compared to masking away, the increased gas costs in validating the arguments is not *that* high - and either of those you need anyways, since just allowing invalid inputs may lead to all sorts of unexpected problems. And validating instead of just masking is an additional safeguard against unexpected behaviour (after all, there's little valid reason for passing garbage in higher-order bits, so if there are, you can usually assume something went wrong and reverting is the safer cause of action).

@ekpyron interesting, didn't noticed that behaviour perviously. So regarding the `abi.decode(calldata)` this issue could be handled during copying `calldata` to `memory`.

If you actually have
```
address[] memory x = abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address[]));
```
you'd get a ``calldata`` to ``memory`` copy, which could actually do the validation.

However, there's nothing preventing you currently from *just* calling ``abi.decode`` itself without using its return values. There's little reason for ever doing so, but that case (so the snippet in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13518#issuecomment-1245328421) would still *technically* break...
It's reasonable to consider whether this breaking pattern is *that* weird, s.t. it's fine to break it in a non-breaking release, though.

But yeah, thinking through this made me actually find some inconsistencies in the validation behavior of such calldata-to-memory copies (arrays with statically-sized base types in legacy code generation still use some old pre-ABIEncoderV2-code-paths that do not do this validation, while via-IR code generation *always* does, and legacy code generation for arrays with dynamic base types also *always* does), so we'll first need to decide how to deal with those.

I would have been try to avoid all these unnecessary checks, which are helpful in 0.01% of cases but eats gas in 100% of the cases.

@ekpyron is there any way how we could attract attention to the feature? Maybe we could setup a grant? Is it a "good first issue"?

I can stage it for discussion - the main hold up here is that it's still a breaking change, albeit on pain of something one could argue is a mere technicality.

Apart from that, the implementation shouldn't take too long for someone familiar with the compiler code - but it's probably not a good first issue.

@ekpyron why it's breaking? I remember we decided that necessary checks could be applied on copying from `calldata` to `memory`. It looks like making `abi.decode` to return `calldata` if input was `bytes calldata`.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13518#issuecomment-1245328421 explains the way in which this is breaking. It's an unfortunate technicality, but we can't just fully ignore it.

@ekpyron I see you mean breaking change is that check happens not in the same place in code, but later on access.

And if you *don't* access later, it's a silent semantics change. However, that's a rather unusual thing to do, so we can/will possibly decide that it's fine to do the change nonetheless.

For the record: we just discussed this in a design call and decided to take the fact that this is a breaking change seriously.

However, since we also want to tie data locations to types and this can *probably* be done non-breakingly, we may be able to achieve something similar together with that, i.e. we could non-breakingly aim for allowing:

```
    (
        address[] calldata targets,
        bytes[] calldata calldatas
    ) = abi.decode(data[1:], (address[] calldata, bytes[] calldata));
```

Together with tying data locations to types.

Also, worth noting that we're not *that* far away from the next breaking release. So doing it in a breaking way does not mean it would have to wait indefinitely.
