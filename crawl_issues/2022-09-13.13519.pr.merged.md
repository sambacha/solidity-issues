These tests are already covered with `cmdLineTests`, but should be more at home as boost tests.
This PR depends on #13376 being merged, i.e. destination branch will be changed to develop once #13376 is merged.

The question that remains is, should `cmdlineTests` that are now covered here be deleted?
