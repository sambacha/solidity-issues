## Description
The compiler is crashing with the following error message:

```
$ yarn test
yarn run v1.22.10
$ npx hardhat compile; truffle test --network local
Solidity 0.8.17 is not fully supported yet. You can still use Hardhat, but some features, like stack traces, might not work correctly.

===========================
assertion failed [block != nullptr]: BasicBlock requested for unrecognized address

/bin/sh: line 1: 12129 Trace/BPT trap: 5       truffle test --network local

```

I contacted truffle support, and they advised that it was a compiler bug and it should be reported here.


<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version:
Truffle v5.4.11 (core: 5.4.11)
Solidity - 0.8.17 (solc-js)
Node v18.7.0
Web3.js v1.5.2

- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): 0.8.17
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): 5.4.11
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: ganache v7.4.1 (@ganache/cli: 0.5.1, @ganache/core: 0.5.1)
- Operating system: Mac OS

## Steps to Reproduce

This error is intermittent, I will record a video to demonstrate it and share it in the comments. Also, documenting the steps below

1. Run truffle test 
```
$ yarn test
yarn run v1.22.10
$ npx hardhat compile; truffle test --network local
```
2. It will compile contracts 
```

3. Run the truffle test again and it might work 
```
$ yarn test
yarn run v1.22.10
$ npx hardhat compile; truffle test --network local
Solidity 0.8.17 is not fully supported yet. You can still use Hardhat, but some features, like stack traces, might not work correctly.

Is that error really coming from the compiler? We do have a struct called [`BasicBlock`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.17/libyul/backends/evm/ControlFlowGraph.h#L172-L207) but no `BuilderBase.h` (it's part of the control flow graph instead).

If it's a compiler problem it should be reproducible just by running `solc` (or solc-js) on it without Truffle or Hardhat. Can you show us the input contracts? Or preferably some minimal piece of code needed to trigger this?

Same for me:

assertion failed [block != nullptr]: BasicBlock requested for unrecognized address
(BuilderBase.h:550 block_for_offset)

And also on MacOs. Same code on Ubuntu works.

This error happens running Deno scripts on macos with M1.  It's nothing to do with solidity per se.

Thanks for confirming @crucialfelix.

In that case I'm going to close this.

# Solved

## The issue

For those who find this and are still stuck with these intermittent errors. The issue (that I had) was that node was installed with x86 arch on an M2 Mac. The underlying issue is with Rosetta, which is used to translate between the x86 instructions to Apple silicon.

I encountered this particular problem where the integrated terminal in VSCode kept using Rosetta as the default option. 

### You can check the arch in your terminal.

```
$ node -e 'console.log(process.arch)'
// That will probably output x86

$ arch
// This will probably output i386
```


## Steps to solve

**If you're using brew, delete node entirely and install `nvm`**

* open up terminal (I use iTerm)
* Run `arch` and make sure it's `arm64`
* Switch to a different version of node (install it if you have to)
  * `nvm install [OTHER VERSION OF NODE]`
  * `nvm use [OTHER VERSION OF NODE]`
* remove the previously used version of node
  * `nvm uninstall [VERSION OF NODE YOU WANT]`
  * `nvm install [VERSION OF NODE YOU WANT]`
  * `nvm use [VERSION OF NODE YOU WANT]`
  * `nvm alias default [VERSION OF NODE YOU WANT]`
* open a new terminal window and check to make sure `node -v` returns the correct node version
* check the output of `node -e 'console.log(process.arch)'`
  * it should now be `arm64`
* don't forget to `npm i -g truffle` and any other global packages you use
* ????
* PROFIT

## Steps to solve in VSCode

Add this into your `settings.json`

```
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.osx": {
    "bash": {
      "path": "arch",
      "args": ["-arm64", "bash", "-l"],
      "overrideName": true
    }
  },
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.osx": "bash"
```

You can also run brew commands this way:

`arch -arm64 brew upgrade`

If you have cpu m1/m2 y can use `nodenv` to install `node` with version you need. So, i made patch inside nodenv builder or inside bash script [/usr/local/bin/node-build](https://github.com/nodenv/node-build/blob/master/bin/node-build#L174) in the platform detector method:
```bash
#  arch="$(uname -m)"
  arch="arm64"
```
it work like a charm. compilation speed increased in 70% or more.

To install some special vesrion:
```bash
nodenv install 18.16.0
nodenv local 18.16.0
```
