# [\#13527 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13527) `merged`: Add git `safe.directory` workaround in emscripten build script

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2022-09-14 12:17](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13527):

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13506 by adding [safe.directory](https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/) git configuration to prevent errors when git traverses files with different ownership.

The binaries match since no changes were made in the building paths.
```
diff soljson.js soljson-ci.js -s    
Files soljson.js and soljson-ci.js are identical
```
```
CI version: 0.8.18-ci.2022.9.14+commit.f0f40cf2.Emscripten.clang
Local version: 0.8.18-ci.2022.9.14+commit.f0f40cf2.Emscripten.clang
```

We still need to investigate the feasibility of the `add-nightly-and-push` action in the solc-bin workflow with branch protection enabled, as mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13506#issuecomment-1245668362

Pinging @r0qs. After you're done with fixing the hardhat test, would be best to finalize this. Just needs a small tweak at this point.

Oh, please don't forget to squash review fixes before merging.
