# [\#13528 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13528) `merged`: Move new issues to triage

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2022-09-15 09:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13528):

This PR adds a simple workflow to move new issues to the [old project board](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects/43) as mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8969#issuecomment-1245619135

The workflow adds any new issue not labeled yet to the Triage column. It requires repository, project and org permissions and only works for github `classic` project board. However, it is easy to adjust it to the `projectV2` api when we move to the new GH boards.
It also has a `dry-run` flag, so nothing will be mutated in the boards until we turn it to false.
The `COLUMN_NAME` is only for debugging and will be removed.

@r0qs can you rebase, and let's ping @cameel; if you've addressed all of the changes, we may as well merge this to test it out :)
