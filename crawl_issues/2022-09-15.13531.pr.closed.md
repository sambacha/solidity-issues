I've done a bit of grepping, and it seems like you're missing a case in `libevmasm/SemanticInformation.cpp` in `invalidInPureFunction(Instruction _instructioN)`. If `DIFFICULTY` was invalid there, then surely `PREVRANDAO` is?

Also in `test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp`, and `test/tools/ossfuzz/protoToYul.cpp`, but those are tools, so maybe not relevant to this PR.

They both have the same value, so it can only contain either `DIFFICULTY` or `PREVRANDAO`, in that switch case i decided to leave the original one.

same with the other cases, all switches just use the number and the semantics didn't really change. Whether we want to update the yul interpreter m_state.difficulty part is a different question, but nothing breaks if we keep it like this.

Not quiet sure why the grammar test fails:

found an exception in the grammar test for `let basefee...` and added one as well for `let prevrandao`

This issue solves #13517 as well, right? Should be added to the top comment.

It should. But just to note, this PR hasn't made Paris the default.

If that is desired I can change that, no problem :)

I tried to keep my automatic [Search & Replace](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13531/commits/513d5a32658127eb4afa44b45cff526a36e87e30) in that commit.

Tests & style are not yet updated, probably some broken due to the rename.
