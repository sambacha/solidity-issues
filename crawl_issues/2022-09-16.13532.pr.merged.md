Need to pull out the docker changes, but first need to cut a new Hera release too.

Since evmc10 supports refund accounting, after this change the tests could include that.

Let's see if #13594 simplifies this too.

What's the status here? Is it ready to be merged along with #13537?

> What's the status here?

I'm still unclear about some of the gas changes, but if we don't want to investigate further it is good to merge (after some squashing).

Ah, ok, I do see the huge drops in some tests. I think it would be better to investigate. We're sometimes basing our optimizer decisions on these costs so better to have some confidence in them.

Marking this as "priority review" for investigating the gas changes, since this will is and will even more so become a blocker for other work.

Rebased after #11087, but tests not updated yet.
