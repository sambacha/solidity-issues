## Description

I need to declare a `bytes1` constant in Solidity (0.8.17). The following used to work, according to code examples I found online:

```
bytes1 b = 0xf;
```

However this gives an error

```
TypeError: Type int_const 15 is not implicitly convertible to expected type bytes1.
```

The implicit conversion only works if the value is specified with two hex digits:

```
bytes1 b = 0x0f;
```

This is an unnecessary and confusing restriction.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.17
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Linux

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
