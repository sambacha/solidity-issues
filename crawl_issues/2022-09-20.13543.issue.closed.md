It seems that [test/libsolidity/semanticTests/structs/copy_from_calldata.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/structs/copy_from_calldata.sol) is misplaced, since it does not involve structs at all, but rather just dynamic arrays. Shouldn't it be inside `array` subdirectory? 
Noticed the possible issue [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13464#issuecomment-1239819462).

True. We should move it and any other non-struct tests from that dir. But I think we should also add an actual test for copying calldata structs.

We already have these:
```
copy_struct_with_nested_array_from_calldata_to_memory.sol
copy_struct_with_nested_array_from_calldata_to_storage.sol
```
