Some error codes have been removed and are no longer emitted (for example, 8760 for shadowing of opcodes). There is currently a risk that those codes are reintroduced with a different meaning.

[`scripts/error_codes.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/db571add54bb55f008bff1b51f3dafad7112b8d6/scripts/error_codes.py) should be amended to include a list of removed error codes and verify that they are not in use in the codebase.
