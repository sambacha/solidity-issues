Can you add `--pretty-print --json-indent 4` in `args` to (`test/cmdlineTests/standard_urls_existing_and_missing/`) like we attempted in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13162#pullrequestreview-1101249411? This is the real test that this change actually works :)

If that passes, we can merge.

In that case , we should add it to an `args` file in `test/cmdlineTests/standard_urls_missing/args` as well. Both of these were giving issues in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13162#pullrequestreview-1101249411

CI failed because error not matched, I will fix it asap.
