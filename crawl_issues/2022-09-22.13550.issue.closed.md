This came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12570#issuecomment-1253478487.

The compiler can parse Yul and output it after processing. Implementing a pretty-printer mode for Yul that does no actual processing would be trivial and potentially useful.

Not sure if we actually want to do this (it's a bit tangential to compiler's main purpose) but on the other hand we already have all the pieces for it. Similar to the situation in #12753.

Hi. I'm looking at this issue. Just want to confirm something, say I have this Yul code:
```yul
// test.sol
{
    let a := 1
    {{ let b := 1
    let d := add(a, b)
    }}
}
```

Is this output from `solc --yul test.sol` what is wanted as pretty-printed Yul?
```yul
object "object" {
    code {
        let a := 1
        {
            {
                let b := 1
                let d := add(a, b)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Or is this what we are looking for:
```
{
    {
        let a := 1
        {
            {
                let b := 1
                let d := add(a, b)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Good question. I think it might be better for the formatter not to add the `object` if it's not there because then it would have to come up with a name and this could affect the meaning of the code. For example `datasize()` should fail if the object you're referencing does not exist - but if you happen to reference `"object"`, and the formatter adds it, it will compile, potentially obscuring a bug in the code.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
