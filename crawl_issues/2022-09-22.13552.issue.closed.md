Related to #13544 and #7665.

Currently command-line tests in StandardJSON mode expect output exactly matching the expectations. This is not a problem until we try to post-process the output and run into problems like #13544.

Since the formatting is irrelevant most of the time, I think `cmdlineTests.sh` should be using `jq` on the output and expectations to reformat them before diffing.

We'll also need a way to disable this to keep tests for the `--pretty-print` CLI option functional. I'd go with that I suggested in #7665, i.e. disable this mode when a file called `no-pretty-print` exists in the test directory.

Maybe you could drop by at the [#solidity-dev](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ethereum_solidity-dev:gitter.im) channel to discuss this first? This is an easy issue but it's also very low priority so I'd rather find something more relevant for you. But this depends on how comfortable you are with C++ so we should talk a bit first.

Yes sir I am comfortable in cpp I have been doing competitive programming for a long time and I have used cpp over there rest it will be better for me if I solve a low priority issue first as this can give me some time to learn new this also rest it's up to you if you can guide me I would take up this issue and solve it.

The problem with low priority issues though is that we get so many PRs solving them that we're currently struggling to get through the backlog (65 open PRs now, down from ~100 not so long ago) and they're taking the team's attention away from the real stuff we should be working on. We do appreciate contributions, but I'd rather find you something related to our current roadmap than this random issue :) Especially that the work to do here is pretty much all Bash, not C++.

If you're good at C++, that's great! We're really in need of more skilled contributors who can take on tasks that are not just simple refactors.

@Krish-bhardwaj How about #13652?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
