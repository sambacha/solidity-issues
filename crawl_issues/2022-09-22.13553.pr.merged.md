I tried to create a checklist for reviewers and contributors to make our reviews a bit more consistent.

Marking it as a draft since I want first to get opinions and feedback from the team. Both about the form and content. Feel free to suggest things you would change, add or remove.

I wanted it to be concise but it's hard to do that while keeping the reasoning clear. I used bold to mark the important parts and make it still somewhat usable as a checklist.

Oh yeah, this should be linked in the [contributing docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#workflow-for-pull-requests) as well.

Thanks @franzihei. All suggestions applied. I guess the style was a bit too casual. I should have skipped contractions and capitalized titles from the beginning :)

I would prefer to not use any questions in the items. But I guess this is just a matter of taste.

I think the main items should be always in imperative form, where the description may contain questions to add details to the main item. But yeah, I guess its just a matter of taste.

It's actually because this is meant to be a checklist for someone who is reviewing a PR (which could be a contributor doing a self-review or a reviewer on our side). So for that reason I think that the question form is more appropriate. The point is to look at the PR critically and ask yourself these questions.

I like the question style because it reminds me more of a checklist to go through ("ask yourself these questions when going through a PR").

Changes applied. Hopefully this version is acceptable to everyone.

I think that enough people from the team saw it so we can merge it if there are no new comments.
