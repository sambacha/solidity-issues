## Description

solc crashes when a specific contract is compiled.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.17+commit.8df45f5f
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: VM or test chain
- Operating system: MacOS Monterey 12.2

## Steps to Reproduce
I just try to compile this contract which find in `solifity_fuzz_corpus`
```solidity
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C
{
        uint y;
	mapping (uint => uint) map;
	function f(address a, bytes memory data) public {
		map[0] = 0;
                y = 0;
		(bool success, bytes memory ret) = a.staticcall(data);
		assert(success);
		assert(map[0] == 0);
                assert(y == 0);
	}
}
```

compile on 0.8.16 solc is ok
compile on 0.8.17 solc without `pragma experimental SMTChecker;` is ok
I suspect the crash caused by SMTChecker module, with specific variable assert?

Thanks for reporting!
Yep looks like an SMTChecker bug.

I can confirm that this crashes with a segmentation fault for me.

Also, removing pretty much anything from the repro other than the `assert(map[0] == 0);` line makes it not crash so it does not seem to be caused by one specific thing in the example.

Yea it's weird. The example is quite simple so there's nothing that immediately strikes me as the issue, which is worrying.

I actually could not reproduce the issue. I tried with the pragma, and without the pragma with the model checker compiler options.

I think it's due to Z3 version on Arch. It segfaults for me with [`4.11.0-1`](https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/z/z3/z3-4.11.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst). Works with the current [`4.11.2-1`](https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/z/z3/z3-4.11.2-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst).

I checked z3 4.11.0 and indeed managed to reproduce it. Unfortunately the crash is inside z3 itself:

```cpp
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff796ed76 in spacer::hypothesis_reducer::reduce_core (this=0x7fffffffa9a0, pf=<optimized out>) at /home/leo/devel/z3/src/muz/spacer/spacer_proof_utils.cpp:621
621	            p = todo.back();
(gdb) bt
#0  0x00007ffff796ed76 in spacer::hypothesis_reducer::reduce_core (this=0x7fffffffa9a0, pf=<optimized out>)
    at z3/src/muz/spacer/spacer_proof_utils.cpp:621
```

z3 4.11.2 seems to have fixed the crash. We should make sure the next release ships linked with z3 4.11.2 since it fixes the issue.
