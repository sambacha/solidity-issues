ðŸ‘‹Hi. ðŸ‘‹
I am working with ERC1155 standard smart contract.

But now all require statements in the contract return **false** even **require(true)**.

I am so confused about this issue.

What's happened in the contract and how can I fix it?

(build env is Hardhat)

Based on this description we will not be able to help. Could you provide a reproduceable minimal test case demonstrating your problem?

I'm going to close this since the issue provides no information about the problem. Feel free to reopen if you can show how to reproduce it with the compiler. As it is, it sounds more like a configuration problem with the framework.
