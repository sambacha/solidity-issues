# [\#13559 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13559) `closed`: Create2 deploys itself instead of deploying the intended contract.

## Description

using this code
```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Factory {
    // Returns the address of the newly deployed contract
    function deploy(address _owner, uint _foo, uint _salt) public payable returns (address) {
        return address(new TestContract{salt: bytes32(_salt)}(_owner, _foo));
    }
}

contract TestContract {
    address public owner;
    uint public foo;

    constructor(address _owner, uint _foo) payable {
        owner = _owner;
        foo = _foo;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```
When I run the deploy function of the factory contract it should deploy the test contract but the address it produces is for another instance of the factory contract.

The ```At Address``` call function on remix is faulty.

It loads the incorrect contract.

I investigated the deployed contract on etherscan and the address was of the intended contract.
