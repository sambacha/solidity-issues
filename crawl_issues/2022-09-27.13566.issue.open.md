Gas estimator built into the compiler (`solc --gas`) has not been actively maintained for some time now and has multiple bugs and missing features.

We don't think it makes sense to put more effort into it so we'll be removing it in the next breaking version. There will be no deprecation warnings because as far as we can tell the estimator is rarely used in practice and there are no major tools that depend on it.
