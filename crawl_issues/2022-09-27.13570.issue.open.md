@bshastry what is the impact of this bug (High, Medium, Low)?

The bug seems to have been introduced in 0.8.4.

Slightly simpler repro:
```bash
solc test.sol --asm --optimize
```
```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public {
        uint x;
        assembly {
            function g(i1, i2, i3) -> o1, o2, o3, o4, o5, o6, o7, o8, o9, o10, o11, o12, o13, o14, o15, o16, o17 {}
            pop(x)
        }
    }
}
```
The problem disappears when the assembly block is not using some variable from the surrounding Solidity code.

I'd say impact is `low` to `medium`. Having this many return variables is not common but not impossible and I can't see a good workaround other than removing at least one return value.

@bshastry I wouldn't tag it as `codegen bug` since it's an ICE. We use that label for stuff that goes through the codegen without error but results in "wrong" code being generated.

I'd say low mostly because of the number of variables involved. Maybe there's a case for medium if this would be encountered often in via Yul compilation but so far I've not seen that.

Another variant

```
contract C {
  bytes s;
  function f() external
  {
    assembly
    {
      function af0(ai0, ai1) -> ao0, ao1, ao2, ao3, ao4, ao5, ao6, ao7, ao8, ao9, ao10, ao11, ao12, ao13, ao14, ao15, ao16
      {
        sstore(s.offset, ai0)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Repro

```
solc --ir-optimized --asm test.sol --optimize
```

Just since this issue just came up in chat, for the record, ``--ir-optimized`` is superfluous in the reproductions. These are issues in the assembler (triggered by ``--asm`` just as it would be with ``--bin``) after legacy code generation and legacy optimizer.

Since @cameel said earlier that this was introduced in 0.8.4, the likely culprit is

```
 * Yul EVM Code Transform: Stack Optimization: Reuse slots of unused function arguments and defer allocating stack slots for return variables until after expression statements and assignments that do not reference them.
```

in the Changelog, so that'd be the first place to look, i.e. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10942

It's probably closely related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10942/files#r585845980

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10942/files#r585845980 reads like when we did those changes, we assumed that the optimizer would flatten all nested functions up front. However, these cases of legacy-codegen-inline assembly, in which the assembly refers to identifiers of Solidity remain unoptimized, so the input situation may look different then from what we expected.
