@cameel @r0qs I'm somehow not sure what to do with #8185. I guess that issue was created, when the script was different. However, right now the only place where we redirect potential errors to `/dev/null` is where we test a specific source for its compilability. We have especially in `test/libsolidity/syntaxTests` sources, that are not compilable. So to introduce a mechanism to show these errors would not make much sense from my point of view. For the other steps - e.g. export and import, we will show the compilation errors (compiler's `stderr` & `stdout`). Also if there is a mismatch between expected- and obtained output we show the diff. However, I introduced also `--exit-on-error`, that will stop on the first mismatch and show exactly what commands where used to allow further investigation of potential problems.

It wasn't really that much different. In [the last revision before the issue was reported](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c13aa5bf34b3fdf65ce4f0fdaacbb764b4955a5e/scripts/ASTImportTest.sh) I see that only `solc` output was being sent to `/dev/null` so basically as it is now.

I think it would still be worthwhile to check why it's not compilable. If it's a compilation error, ignore. But if it's an ICE or a segfault, I'd print the error and exit.

But to detect that, it would be best to compile via Standard JSON since then we can check if we got valid JSON on output. I wouldn't do this in this PR though because it's a bit unrelated. So just post a comment about it in the issue and leave it open.

This is nice and I think it solves part of that issue. I'd still keep it open as I said above though.

Hmm.. interesting idea.. I think we should change return codes in `solc/main.cpp` so that we get `0` on success, `1` on normal failures but `2` on exceptions. 

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13633

After #13633 got merged, I change the script accordingly. However, the script will ignore all `UnimplementedFeatureError` exceptions.

Running the branch locally, I got the following result:
```
SUCCESS: 1103 tests passed, 0 failed, 1883 could not be compiled (2986 sources total).
```
Is it expected that 1883 cannot be compiled?

Ah yes! The reason for that the syntax tests. Many of these syntax tests consists of errors to be able to check for specific behaviour of the parser. Maybe we should change that to only use the semantic test cases. But in general the high amount of not compilable tests are expected.

I think that syntax tests are actually more important for this feature than semantic tests. At least with regard to AST import/export - because they generally use more varied syntax so I'd expect them to cover more corner cases of the AST. For assembly import/export it might actually be the opposite though so ideally we'd have both.

@r0qs @cameel  The original script did not invoke the code generator. This was changed in this PR. Thats why many of the syntax tests were treated as non-compilable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13576#discussion_r1018435755. I corrected this now.

I also added now another change in `scripts/common.sh`. I noticed that the `printStackTrace` function was not working correctly under macOS. The `cut` command there is not the gnu version (similar to `readlink`). This version does not support e.g. `--delimiter`. However, on macOS it will now use `gcut` instead of `cut`.

I just applied it. ðŸ˜› Didn't see the need to wait.
Now waiting for the tests to pass.
