# [\#13581 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13581) `merged`: Let the nightlies call themselves 'nightly', the return.
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

Since PR[#10772](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10772), nightly builds started to call themselves `ci` during the build. 

This happens because the nightly workflow in the solc-bin repo invokes the `build_emscripten.sh` from the solidity repo, in line [78](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/nightly-emscripten.yml#L78), after the script set the `prerelease.txt` to the nightly version (line [53](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/.github/workflows/nightly-emscripten.yml#L53)), thus overwriting the `prerelease.txt` created by the workflow. 

The creation of the `prerelease.txt` file was added to the nightly workflow here https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/64 to fix the issue when nightly builds were calling themselves `develop`. Now, they want to be `ci`, but we should not allow it!

You can see the error by running:
```javascript
solc.loadRemoteVersion("v0.8.15-nightly.2022.5.27+commit.095cc647", (err, compiler) => {
    console.log(compiler.version())
})
```
Which returns: `0.8.15-ci.2022.5.27+commit.095cc647.Emscripten.clang` 
Instead of: `0.8.15-nightly.2022.5.27+commit.095cc647.Emscripten.clang`

EDITED:
~The PR adds a condition to not modify the `prerelease.txt` file if it is a `nightly` build.~
The PR adds an optional argument to set the release binary name in the `build` script and also modifies the `emscripten_build` script to receive optional parameters for the same purpose. Parameters were used in the latter instead of arguments since the script would have more than one optional argument, requiring the user to provide the first argument even if he only wants to set the second.
The docker script was also modified to forward the parameters to the CI scripts.
If no parameters are given, the script behaves as before.

It should be merged before https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/123.

Also, needs rebase and commit squashing.

Is there any difference in squashing commits manually via console, i.e. `git rebase -i` and simply selecting the `squash and merge` option on github?

Probably just description. Also, I'm not sure if it creates a merge commit (and I'd prefer if it did).

I think it's fine to use it when you know you want a single commit.

@r0qs I think this is still not rebased on latest `develop`. Note the `force_release` jobs that do not run. They were renamed in one of the PRs merged recently and apparently your branch is not on top of changes from that PR.

Yes. I will rebase and squash the commit. I was waiting for your input in the previous comments to do that :)

@r0qs https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13581#discussion_r1029467995 is the only thing left. After that it's good to merge.
