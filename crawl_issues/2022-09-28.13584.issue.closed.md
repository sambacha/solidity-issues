We should have a CI check that enforces the presence of docstrings on all files, classes and public functions. Possibly also for some other things like enums.

This is often pointed out in reviews and automating it would make them less tedious.

We'll need some kind of whitelist for now though because not all of the code strictly follows this rule and going back and writing proper docstrings would be a huge effort to do at once.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
