PR for #7665 

1. updated [test/cmdlineTests.sh](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/compare/develop...GeorgePlotnikov:solidity:use-pretty-json-for-cmlinetests-output?expand=1#diff-568183246dfdd2dc67bd8ac41016a8b57a33acdd02654a981cec9851df864f02) to
  a. use `--pretty-json --indent 4` as a standard output formatting for cmdline tests
  b. fix regexes to strip bytecode, opcode, sourcemap
2. updated expected output
3. pay attention on these tests. I used the following versions of `z3 4.11.0` `CVC4 1.8` + [the latest symfpu](https://github.com/martin-cs/symfpu). Logical expressions were rebuilt but have equals meaning

@cameel @leonardoalt @matheusaaguiar 

These
- ci/circleci: t_osx_cli
- ci/circleci: t_ubu_cli
- ci/circleci: t_ubu_release_cli

failed because of p.3 from the description. To eliminate this discrepancy I can update the expected output accordingly or these jobs (probably build agents or jobs configuration) should be updated. Need a decision on that.

Looks like your local expectations do not match what we're getting in CI. Not sure why that is (you do have Z3 4.8.11 so it should match - @leonardoalt, can that be due to CVC4?) but I think the simplest solution would be to just accept the version from our CI.

@GeorgePlotnikov the cmdline tests expected output can be updated automatically running with the option `--update`:
```
./test/cmdlineTests.sh --update
```
It is also a good idea to run `isoltest` with a similar option. In this case nothing should change, nonetheless it is worth to be mentioned for the sake of future contributions:
```
./build/test/tools/isoltest --enforce-gas-cost --optimize --accept-updates
```
This way you should get the tests expected output updated and then they will not fail in CI.
That being said, I don't understand why the changes in the expected outputs. They seem to be equivalent to what we already have, just changing conditions to the negation of their opposite, i.e, `(x' <= 0)` --> `!(x' >= 1)`.

I noticed that you mentioned  using `symfpu`, would it be responsible for the introduced changes in the tests expected output?

UPD: trying to figure out what is the problem with [standard_json_recovery](https://github.com/GeorgePlotnikov/solidity/tree/f8b38f0d0ea2128c657c41a73b08e524509c7af6/test/cmdlineTests/recovery_standard_json). occasionally it fails regardless accepting suggested output (a \n appears or disappears) which is weird, probably somewhere not obvious error.

p. s. sorry for many build-failed commits
p. p. s. @matheusaaguiar I have run `isoltest` and 23 of them were updated (mostly counterexamples were added) but I want to make the deal with `recover_standard_json` first.

This seems like the same problem we had [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13162#discussion_r966314538).
I think that we did not investigated it further in that occasion because it was not breaking other PRs... (guess we should open an issue and/or starting investigating it, @cameel ?)
For now, it seems to me that you should just remove the problematic linebreak and move on with the work.

@GeorgePlotnikov , on another topic, I see that you have merged `develop` branch in one of the commits. We do prefer a rebase instead of that. Could you fix it, please?

We did, kinda. In the end I realized what the problem was and reported it in #13544. which is now fixed.

Yeah, I recommend checking our newly added [ReviewChecklist](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReviewChecklist.md).

@matheusaaguiar @cameel  at last I founded a problem in regex on the line 196:

`json = re.sub("\n\\s+\n", "\n\n", json) # Remove trailing whitespace` -> `json = re.sub("\n\\s*\n", "\n", json)`

otherwise the puzzle will never be completed (if there is no expected `\n` it appears and vise-versa) now - fixed).
The branch is also rebased + [ReviewChecklist](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/ReviewChecklist.md) updated. Please review.

@GeorgePlotnikov I would recommend squashing your commits a bit. I'd normally say it at the end of review but you accumulated quite a few of them so squashing now might make your life easier. It does not have to be a single commit but each commit should represent a single logical change relative to `develop`, without going back and forth and commits that undo things other commits did (i.e. the review fixes should just be squashed into the original commits).
