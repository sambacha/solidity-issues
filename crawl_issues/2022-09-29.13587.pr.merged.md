I don't think it's that trivial :p
main question is, why?

Faster compilation due to less headers included in places where it isn't necessary?

Also, headers included in the places where they are actually used and not indirectly through EVMVersion.h

Both things I understood to be universally agreed...

That may be true, but it could also have been written as the motivation in the first place.

Especially because forward declarations are usually code smell.

Therefore even though I agree with this specific point, I find the forward declaration worse and think it shouldn't be there.

I guess the question now is whether we go forward with the forward declarations (lol), or close this as won't do? @Marenz if you were to benchmark this, would we see any significant gain in compilation times (doesn't have to be significant I guess, just noticeable)?

I think it's good.
