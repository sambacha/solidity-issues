I focused on the issue under More Concise "Cheatsheet" Page related to converting the list of global variables to a table. For this issue, I just used the ..list-table::  command for the reStructuredText format.

Partly fixes: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12934

@mariagabrielacs123 Are you still interested in working on this?

I've also taken a look at this, and honestly, I think leaving it as is (i.e. without table) is the way to go. Our documentation page width is quite narrow, and if create the table in such a way that there's no line breaks in column 1 and 2, we'll end up with a tiny third column (description), which will have a ton of line breaks.

I vote for closing the issue.

Well, now I see the initial approach used only two columns (having the return type included in the first column), which would certainly be better that what is currently on `develop`, so that might be an option.

I think this should really be a table. What we have currently is compact but not very readable at a glance - as a cheatsheet should be. I'm sure this can be converted into one, but looks like it will require more adjustments than just putting what we have in into a table. It probably just has too much info. We could shorten the descriptions and play more with the content.

I tried it and it does not look that bad. The descriptions are relatively short. The biggest problem are actually two snippets in backticks that don't wrap and go past the edge of the table.

Well, I think that's what we should do - but that's just because we don't have time for this now and it's very low priority. I do think this can be improved and made fit for a table but for this we need someone willing to actually experiment more with both the format and the content.

I did play with it for a moment last week and managed to get `:widths:` working. I also reduced padding and introduced another column for arguments. I pushed to code to the PR so please take a look. I think it's not that bad but also not great (I have mixed feelings about how arguments are presented) and still needs some work.

Maybe two columns is the way to go for now. I'd be fine going back to that (while keeping the width ajustments) or just closing the PR.

I just took a look, and to be honest, it's still not great; longer values in the `Arguments` column still break, which is not an improvement in my opinion. The description - while not that bad - is still excessively crammed in my opinion.

I've updated the description to link to the original issue, and am still for closing this PR until we have more time for it. This PR should be linked to the issue, so the future implementer should have full context as to what we tried, why it didn't work, and what should be done/attempted in the next PR.
