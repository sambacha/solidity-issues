Updated outputCompilationResults() to appropriately report when there are no contracts to compile. As requested in issue #4617 (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4617) the needsHumanTargetedStdout check was removed so the header is printed for all contracts regardless of options presented. The needsHumanTargetedStdout was then deleted as it was not used anywhere else.
