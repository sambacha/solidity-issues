This pull request provides the functionality and updates the test cases necessary to address [this issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4617). 

The issue requests the output from solc be updated to specify when no contract was supplied and print the header regardless of options specified without altering the current functionality when only abstract contracts etc are provided. 

This was achieved by adding functionality CommandLineInterface::outputCompilationResults() to provide appropriate output when no contract is supplied and removing the checks necessary to print headers. Headers will now always print if a contract is supplied.

The test cases were updated to accept the new output as previously the tests would check that no output was provided in these conditions. As such 8 automated tests fail when creating this pull request as they are failing on the new output provided.

@Andy53 thanks for the contribution by the way! One thing to not in the future - if you decide to continue contributing, which would be great, is to create a separate branch in your fork, and open a PR from there, instead of working on your fork's develop directly.

We discussed this yesterday, so before merging, this PR should be closed, and a new one opened on a separate branch (working directly on `develop` is against the unwritten rules).

One thing that's obviously missing is a test case that will target the compilation of a file without contracts, which should then assert that proper output has been received - in this case
```
Compiler run successful, no contracts to compile.
```
Also, another couple of test cases need to be added, mainly to address Chris' comment in the original issue
```
We should also check what happens if contracts are present but are abstract or interfaces.
```
