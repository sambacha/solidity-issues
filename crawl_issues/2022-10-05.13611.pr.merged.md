Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13362.

I managed to reproduce the problem locally using a Kinetic docker image, and upon some investigation, it turns out that the problem was related to this [change](
https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debhelper/-/commit/5debbd6171dd2a091dde9ed499d8bb118ed2e1a8) in the `debhelper` package used to build the `.deb`.

The change, released in debhelper version [13.8](https://launchpad.net/debian/+source/debhelper/13.8), enables the cmake [FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#variable:FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED) option by default, which prevents cmake from downloading or updating any content and assumes that it is already available. This option was set to `OFF` in all debhelper releases prior to 13.8.

The current `fmtlib` cmake configuration depends on the `FetchContent` module and thus fails to retrieve the package, throwing the chain of linking errors as shown here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13362#issuecomment-1240976092.

This issue only affects kinetic, since all other versions used by our `release_ppa` script rely on the old configuration (where the option was set to `OFF`):
```
focal: debhelper (12.10ubuntu1)
jammy: debhelper (13.6ubuntu1)
kinetic: debhelper (13.9.1ubuntu1)
```

This PR forces the cmake option to be `OFF` again to allow cmake to fetch the content. Another alternative would be to change the current `fmtlib` cmake configuration to not rely on `FetchContent_MakeAvailable` and use `ExternalProject_Add` instead.

I guess something like https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#variable:FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED may also be an option. Still we can merge this as is to get things working and then decide whether we want to switch to another solution.

> Oh, wow... this has a lot of implications :-). If I understand this correctly, we can just drop the downloading of the fmt sources elsewhere in the script (as well as the others for that matter).

Yeah, but currently, only `fmtlib` uses `FetchContent` module, right? So maybe it is easy just to replace its cmake config. I can do that if you think it is a better option. I tried to be less invasive as possible since I am still getting my head around the current build process, haha

> I think some time in the past, this already defaulted to `ON` and that's why we have those downloads in there - I still thought the ppa builds were fully offline the whole time :-).

Ah! Right, yeah, I didn't check all previous debhelper, only until 12.10. And to be honest, I thought that too when I looked at the `release_ppa` script because it downloads the dependencies before running the dpkg. So, it was a bit weird that the cmake was also attempting to do the same instead of first looking if the dependency exists locally.

> I'm approving this, since it's the easiest quick fix for the issue at hand, but we should rethink our handling of dependencies here - it's also a bit weird that we add json-cpp to our source archives in scripts/create_source_tarball.sh, but we don't add range-v3 or fmtlib there, etc.

Hum, I wasn't aware of this script. Where is it used?

The problem is that the `FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED` and `FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED` are already `OFF` by default in cmake. However, debhelper is now setting the `FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED` to `ON`, so `FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED` would not have effect anyway, I guess.

The weird thing is: we *do* predownload fmtlib - I'd have imagined cmake with ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED`` to just pick the already downloaded archive up in that case :-).

During the release process to create the tarball that ends up being uploaded to the github release page :-) (the script is mentioned in ReleaseChecklist.md for that purpose). I.e. the github source archives like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.17/solidity_0.8.17.tar.gz, currently weirdly contain ``deps/downloads/jsoncpp-1.9.3.tar.gz``, but *don't* contain the other dependencies :-). But yeah, we should do https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9720, s.t. we can rely on the auto-generated github source archives anyways - and those won't contain *any* dependencies. It's good that a few dependencies are already missing, since that confirms that it's fine to implicitly drop all of them that way :-).

I merged this for now in any case, just that we're sure not to run into this in the next release :-).

Yeah, it does not seem like it. As far as I understood, when it is turned ON, it assumes that the content has already been populated. So we need to extract the downloaded source somewhere and change the logic of the `fmtlib` cmake config to populate the dependency manually if it cannot be fetched. I will take a look on how we can improve that.
