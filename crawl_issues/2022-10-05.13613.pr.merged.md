Hi @Andy53 , it seems that in your last commit you mistakenly merged branch `develop` on your PR branch instead of rebasing on top of the former.
You could fix it by first rewinding the last commit and then rebasing on top of develop.
```
git reset --merge HEAD~1
git rebase -i origin/develop
```
The rebase command with `-i` should open an interactive session in which you can choose to squash some commits, like the `trailing whitespace` ones, for example.
Feel free to ask or dm if you need help.

This rebase did not go to plan sadly :( I seem to have pulled 2 commits in from another branch.

So the latest push [4357949](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/43579491e3ba267d23afaaefdd768e7906bd7973) seems to be correct. It's got just the changes to the documentation required for the PR and nothing else.

Sorry, maybe I misdirect you with the commands I suggested. Probably, the `origin/develop` you rebased onto is actually your own fork repository. Maybe you have a `upstream` remote which points to the solidity original repo? If not, you can add it with:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git
git fetch upstream
```
Anyway, there are still commits not belonging and also the last one you mentioned, [4357949](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/43579491e3ba267d23afaaefdd768e7906bd7973), is your first modification.
Try to see if you can still find the other relevant commits and then rebase on the `develop` branch of the original solidity repo. Otherwise, I have resumed the changes so far in my local copy and can push them later.

I think I might have got it right this time. Files changed is down to 1 now.

Restored the lost modifications and rebased on top of `develop`.
