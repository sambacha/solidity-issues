The bytecode PR check in solc-bin [assumes that PR branches are always available in the repo](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/199db16cc9b2af20c04536ff0b1c7bba21a874bf/.github/workflows/t-bytecode-compare.yml#L66-L71). This results in CI failures on external PRs, for example [5140692597](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/actions/runs/3158544890/jobs/5140692597) (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/123):
```
Commit range: origin/gh-pages..origin/ci-to-nightly
fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/ci-to-nightly': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
```

The code needs to be adjusted to handle external PRs as well, e.g. by creating a local tracking branch in the checkout.
