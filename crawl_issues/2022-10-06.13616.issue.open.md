Our `check_style.sh` script is supposed to post the errors it finds as a comment in the PR. E.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10653#issuecomment-748128097. Looks like it does not work with external PRs, due to permission issues. For example in [1184923](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/26748/workflows/45c1a6ca-bb58-40fe-ad72-4cc8681d1cf3/jobs/1184923) from #13595 you can see this error: 
```
posting error message to github
{
  "message": "Requires authentication",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue-comment"
}
ERROR: Error message does not contain file path.
```
and there's no comment in the issue.

Is there something we can do to fix it? The bug tracker is public so CI should not need any specific permissions/tokens to post a comment, even when it's someone not from the team triggering it.

Fixing this save us having to constantly point this out in external PR reviews.
