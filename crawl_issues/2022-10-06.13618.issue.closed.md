#13376 added support for modifying optimizer's cleanup sequence. It's possible to do that both on the CLI and via StandardJSON with `settings.optimizer.details.yulDetails.optimizerSteps` but looks like we did not update StandardJSON [Input Description](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#input-description) to mention that. The comment for the option should mention that it's possible to change the cleanup sequence and direct users to [Selecting Optimizations](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/optimizer.html#selecting-optimizations) for more details.
