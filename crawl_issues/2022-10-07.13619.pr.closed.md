I have altered the title and added the issue link to the description. I have merged in the changes suggested which involved removing the hard link. I have added some clarifications to address the comments regarding having 2 sequences.

My git skills are incredibly weak and I don't know how to squash the review changes and google is not giving me any obvious answers so if you have instructions on how to do this somewhere I will be happy to get it done.

> @cameel, is it OK to put URLs here? I feel as though it's a better approach than leaving written breadcrumbs, i.e. `"The Optimizer > Selecting Optimizations".`

I suggested removing the link myself (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13619#discussion_r991256922) :). See the comment but overall, the problem is that the link leads specifically to latest docs at soliditylang.org, not to the docs you're looking at, wherever and for whatever version they are.

I agree that written breadcrumbs suck but I think that's a part of a more general problem that having this documented in a form of a giant JSON snippet sucks in general. I often need to link to docs of some specific field and all I can do is just point at the whole section. I think that rewriting it as a series of tables would solve both problems. Not sure if others agree though so maybe we should discuss that.

In this particular PR, I don't think we can do better than breadcrumbs unfortunately.

This article seems to describe it well: [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Squashing Commits with Git Rebase](https://medium.com/@slamflipstrom/a-beginners-guide-to-squashing-commits-with-git-rebase-8185cf6e62ec).

In short, you just check out your branch and do `git rebase --interactive develop`. It will open an editor (make sure your `$EDITOR` environment variable is set and contains the name of an editor you're comfortable with, e.g. `vim` or `nano` or whatever you use) and let you rearrange or squash your commits into each other.
