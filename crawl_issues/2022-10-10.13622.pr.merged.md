**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Clang 16 that is used by upstream oss-fuzz contains a warning called `-Wshorten-64-to-32` (see https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html#wshorten-64-to-32) that errors protobuf fuzzer builds.

This is because of protobuf compiler auto-generated files implicitly perform this implicit conversion.

Since fixing upstream protobuf compiler is tedious, this PR "fixes" the failing build by passing the `-Wno-shorten-64-to-32` flag to protobuf fuzzer builds.

Commenting makes sense. Will update.

Regarding a default on option, I think it will be good to retain this warning for the rest of the Solidity code base.
