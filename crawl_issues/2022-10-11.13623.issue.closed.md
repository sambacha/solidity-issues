The contract
```solidity
  contract C {
      uint public x;
  }
```
generates
```
            {
                let _1 := memoryguard(0x80)
                mstore(64, _1)
                if iszero(lt(calldatasize(), 4))
                {
                    let _2 := 0
                    if eq(0x0c55699c, shr(224, calldataload(_2)))
                    {
                        if callvalue() { revert(_2, _2) }
                        if slt(add(calldatasize(), not(3)), _2) { revert(_2, _2) }
                        mstore(_1, sload(_2))
                        return(_1, 32)
                    }
                }
                revert(0, 0)
            }
```

The revert in ` if slt(add(calldatasize(), not(3)), _2) { revert(_2, _2) }` is unreachable. We should remove this.

There are two ways to do this:

1. The check for `calldatasize` lower bounds should only be done if there is at least one parameter.
2. Build a symbolic solver that can infer this property.

Given that (1) is just a simple `if` in the codegen, I think that waiting for the solver would be a bit of an overkill here :)

By the way, `if iszero(lt(calldatasize(), 4))` is redundant too. At least as long as the last byte of the selector is non-zero (and this can be determined at compilation time).

Why? `calldatasize` is dynamic and can only be known at runtime? @cameel

Because if it's shorter than 4 bytes, `if eq(0x0c55699c, shr(224, calldataload(_2)))` will never be true so the code will lead to the same revert.

Ah I see. We can only do that change in codegen if there is no function that has a selector 0.

It's also worth thinking if that check should be delayed to the end of the function dispatch.

I'd say more generally, if the selector does not end with a zero byte (otherwise a truncated selector in calldata might match).

> It's also worth thinking if that check should be delayed to the end of the function dispatch.

I think we would risk going into the wrong branch with truncated calldata so probably no.

Why zero byte? @cameel

Because otherwise when you send e.g. `0x112233` in calldata it would match selector `0x11223300`. The size check is only redundant if the selector does not end with a zero. Otherwise zeros read past the end could be mistaken for actual zeros sent by the client.

Has this issue been fixed? If not I would like to try working on it.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
