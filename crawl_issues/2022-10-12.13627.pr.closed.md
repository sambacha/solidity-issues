Thank you very much for the PR, but I think there is some misunderstanding here.

The mixed upper and lower casing of the hexadecimal digits of the address is not a mistake, but serves as a checksum. See https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/types.html?highlight=address#address-literals, resp. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md for a full explanation.

The 32 byte value above does *not* use an address checksum, since, well, it's not an address. So the difference is very much intentional.

Given that, I'm closing the PR.
