The receive function documentation is slightly inaccurate currently as a contract can still receive Ether through payable functions even if no receive or payable fallback function is present.

@Dev-Doggo can you please rebase against the latest upstream develop so we can get at least the `euler` and `gp2` jobs to go green. `ext_hardhat` will still unfortunately be red, but at least the build will be as green as possible at the moment, and we can merge this in.

Thanks @Dev-Doggo. Also note for future reference: merging develop into your branch is not the same as rebasing.

@nikola-matic Yep, sorry about that I'm not great with git, I think I fixed it.
