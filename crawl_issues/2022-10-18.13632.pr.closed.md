Adds support to Isoltest to load tests from arbitrary paths. Tests are copied into the semanticTests folder and deleted upon completion, an entry has been added to .gitignore so they don't cause problems. Fixes #13551

Thank you very much for the contribution, but copying files to the test directories and deleting them is definitely not the way to go here. I posted a suggestion for how to do this instead to the underlying issue, but until the details are settled here, also removed the "good first issue" label from it.

So sorry for the underlying issue being marked "good first issue" despite being underspecified - but given that I'll close this PR.
