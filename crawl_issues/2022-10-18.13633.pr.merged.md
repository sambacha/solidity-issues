It could be useful to distinguish normal errors from exceptions. `solc` will now return `0` on success, `1` on normal failures, but `2` on exceptions. 

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13576#issuecomment-1282912101.

Sure, why not. But then I'd also use that convention in other executables like `isolteset` or `yul-phaser`.

Oh, this also should have a changelog entry.

Also, needs a rebase (gp2 is already fixed on `develop`).

Ok, merging this... I hope it doesn't break anything anywhere, but it should be fine...
