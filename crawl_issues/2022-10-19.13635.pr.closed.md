Added a check to SemanticTest.cpp to ensure all output is printed on new lines. Also added a test (emit_multiple_outputs.sol). Fixes #13592

> Hey @Andy53, so I've taken a more detailed look at the PR, and it turns out that it's a fairly simple issue. Namely, the reason the expected results were printed on the same line is that `TestFunctionCall::format` we were checking that the current side effect is not equal to the last side effect so as not to insert a new line after the last element is piped into the `stringstream`.
> 
> In case of two identical emits, the first will be equal to the last, and a new line will therefore not be inserted. In order to solve this, the only necessary thing is to refactor the looping of elements in the `sideEffects` vector, i.e.:
> 
> ```c++
> if (!sideEffects.empty())
> {
> 	stream << std::endl;
> 	size_t i = 0;
> 	for (; i < sideEffects.size() - 1; ++i)
> 		stream << _linePrefix << "// ~ " << sideEffects[i] << std::endl;
> 	stream << _linePrefix << "// ~ " << sideEffects[i];
> }
> ```
> 
> Nothing else is necessary here, so the changes in `SemanticTest.cpp` should be reverted.

Also, I've implemented this in your branch, so if you don't feel doing this yourself, I can pushed the changes :)
