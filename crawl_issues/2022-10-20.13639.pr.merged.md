Implements the first item of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13615

This PR adds an action to comment on PRs from external contributors. It requires a token with `read:org` permissions to be able to check whether the contributor is a member of the organization.

Please, remember to create the secret in the solidity repo with the name `READ_ORG` using a PAT with `read:org` scope.

Maybe we should rename the secret to something that says what it is, rather what it's used for? This way, looking at settings, we'll at least know what each secret actually is. Otherwise we'll have to have @chriseth add a copy of the secret for each thing we use it for (I don't even see a way to clone it in the UI).

Something like `STACKENBOTTEN_PAT` might be a better name. Or it could be more generic like `PROJECT_AUTOMATION_PAT` but still something that identifies the actor, i.e. the account we use for project automation.

The same secret should then be used instead of `PROJECT_BOARD_AUTOMATION` in the other action.
