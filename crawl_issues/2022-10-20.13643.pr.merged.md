**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

For some reason, `npm install` is not able to resolve some dependencies (namely [keyv](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts/blob/main/yarn.lock#L2570)), and thus the build of gp2 fails.

The CI job report the following error https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/26946/workflows/f1a18e69-c5ec-4f7d-84c1-845b7f8abf2e/jobs/1194591?invite=true#step-104-141
```
yarn run v1.22.15
$ tsc && tsc -p tsconfig.lib.esm.json && tsc -p tsconfig.lib.commonjs.json
error TS2688: Cannot find type definition file for 'keyv'.
  The file is in the program because:
    Entry point for implicit type library 'keyv'
```

The [gp2 repo](https://github.com/gnosis/gp-v2-contracts) only contains a `yarn.lock` file and npm versions v7+ should support `yarn.lock` files (https://blog.npmjs.org/post/621733939456933888/npm-v7-series-why-keep-package-lockjson). However, this does not seem to be the case for our CI even though the npm version is 8.1.2.

This PR replaces npm with yarn to resolve the missing dependency and also update the gp2 repository since the original was archived.

Update: I found this issue: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/62793, which refers to the source of the problem, although the solution is still unclear.

Also, can you include the link to the failing job and the error message in the PR description? It makes it easier to later check if an error is something we've seen before - and how we fixed it.
