<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).
- If you feel uncertain about your feature request, perhaps it's better to open a language design or feedback forum thread via the issue selector, or by going to the forum directly.

## Abstract
You can't implicitly define storage variables in the constructor and have to define ones explicitly.

It forces developers to **always** define the state variables explicitly:
```solidity
contract Contract {
  uint256 a;
  uint256 b;
  constructor(uint256 _a, uint256 _b) {
    a = _a;
    b = _b:
  }
}
```

Such not only expands the overall source size but also creates possible security flaws when dealing with **underscores**. There are plenty of cases when developers have forgotten to put one, leading to _incorrect logic execution_ with _loss of funds_. 
<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

## Motivation
Such has been a feature in many languages.

Consider the next JavaScript example:
```js
class ContractLike {
  constructor(public a, private b) {}
}
```
It's much simpler to define variables this way, instead of
```js
class ContractLike {
  public a;
  public b;
  constructor(a, b) {
    this.a = a;
    this.b = b;
  }
}
```

Solidity should follow the latest industry standards and keep with them where possible.
<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

## Specification

If variables put in `constructor` come with state visibility parameters, they are automatically placed on the storage top in the same order they are put in the `constructor`.

Example:
```solidity
contract Contract {
  constructor(address public a, uint256 public immutable b, bool private c, int128 internal d) {
    a = 0x0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567;
    b = 11;
    c = false;
    d = -12;
  }
}
```
If there are explicitly declared storage variables, they are put after the ones defined in the constructor (or before, depending on the implementation details).

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

## Backwards Compatibility
The feature is fully backward compatible as it does not break the current syntax but only extends it.

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

This would violate the design principles of solidity in explicitness and clear readability of the storage layouts, so I'm closing this.
