Rectified issue in TestFunctionCall::Format to ensure emit logs are printed on separate lines. Added two tests to check for proper emit output.  Fixes #13592

I have opened a new pull request here due to when I tried to rebase the last one I made a few mistakes. Old PR: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13635

This PR is failing the gp2 test with an error that's already fixed. I think your fork is not up to date. Please rebase on latest `develop`.
