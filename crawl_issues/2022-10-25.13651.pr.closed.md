Temporary workaround for https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3295.

`t_ems_ext_hardhat` is failing in all our PRs now. All tests in the suite fail with an errors like this (from [1198229](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/27026/workflows/5de23979-ad27-45d3-a053-0fd3f5c2d1b0/jobs/1198229)):

```

The patch hard-codes the version to the last released one, which at least makes Hardhat not reject the version outright. Hopefully there's not much hard-coded specifically for 0.8.17 inside Hardhat. We should remove this as soon as the upstream issue is fixed.

Turns out this way of fixing it won't work. It's not just `HARDHAT_TESTS_SOLC_VERSION`, the whole mechanism for supplying a custom binary is broken.
