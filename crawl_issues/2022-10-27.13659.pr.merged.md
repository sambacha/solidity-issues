This pull request provides the functionality and updates the test cases necessary to address https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4617.

The issue requests the output from solc be updated to specify when no contract was supplied and print the header  when ewasm, ir or ir-optimized is specified without altering the current functionality when only abstract contracts etc are provided.

The test cases were updated to accept the new output as previously the tests would check that no output was provided in these conditions. Additionally 2 new test cases were added to cmdline tests, one to test no contract outputs the correct statement and one to check a file containing a number of abstract contracts and interfaces produces no output.

This replaces the current PR [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13606) duet to the fact that was done on the develop branch.

Tests are failing. Please keep the PR as "draft" until it's working and ready for review.
