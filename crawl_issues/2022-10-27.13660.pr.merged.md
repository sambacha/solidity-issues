This is a bunch of tweaks extracted from #12362 to make that PR smaller. They're all related to changes made there but make sense on their own as well.

By the way, does changing error/warning/other messages require a changelog entry?

Depends on the size/impact of the change. I wouldn't add one for something trivial like this but if we were changing a lot of messages in a systematic way or addressing something that's a known annoyance to users, we could consider adding a change log entry.
