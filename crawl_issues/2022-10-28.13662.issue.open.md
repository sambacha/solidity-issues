# [\#13662 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13662) `open`: Allow overloading of custom errors
**Labels**: `low effort`, `low impact`, `must have eventually`

## Abstract

Allow custom error with the same name, but different parameter, to be declared

## Motivation

According to [this blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/), custom errors are encode similarly to function call.

> The error data would be encoded identically as the ABI encoding for function calls, i.e., 
> `abi.encodeWithSignature("InsufficientBalance(uint256,uint256)", balance[msg.sender], amount)`.

However, declaring
```
error InsufficientBalance(address owner); // for ERC20
error InsufficientBalance(address owner, uint256 tokenId); // for ERC1155
```
result in an error `DeclarationError: Identifier already declared`.

This should be allowed IMO.

## Backwards Compatibility

N/A

There are some backwards compatibility concerns here but very mild IMO and not worth discarding this feature. There is a valid assumption today that would be broken with overloading: that a custom error name is unique within a contract.

This is still relevant.

@NunoFilipeSantos @cameel Can this be triaged before closing as stale?

From a development perspective, errors are really similar to functions.
Is there any sufficient difference between the implementations?

```js
  // == Error within `error` == //
  error CustomError(uint16 param16, uint224 /* no parameter */);

  function usageCustomError() external pure {
    revert CustomError(17, 18);
  }

  // == Error within `function` == //
  function FunctionError(
    uint16 param16,
    uint224 param224
  ) internal pure returns (uint256 freemem_pointer, uint256 length) {
    string memory sig = "FunctionError(uint16,uint224)";
    assembly {
      freemem_pointer := mload(0x40)

      let sign := keccak256(add(sig, 0x20), mload(sig))
      sign := and(sign, shl(224, 0xFFFFFFFF))

      mstore(add(freemem_pointer, 0x00), sign)
      mstore(add(freemem_pointer, 0x4), param16)
      mstore(add(freemem_pointer, 0x24), param224)

      length := 0x44
    }
  }

  function usageFunctionError() external pure {
    (uint256 pointer, uint256 length) = FunctionError(17, 18);
    assembly {
      revert(pointer, length)
    }
  }
```

- Possibly Custom Errors use less Gas
- Custom Errors may have unnamed parameters

From the perspective of equals of the implementations, it is possible to consider Custom Errors to be special functions and overflow should be possible.
It may be possible to provide a wider standard of error message decoding to **allow any type which has a selector to be an error**.
