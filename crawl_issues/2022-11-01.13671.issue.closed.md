```solidity
contract C {
    bool lock;
    modifier nonReentrant() {
        require(lock);
        lock = true;
        _;
        lock = false;
    }

    function earlyReturn() nonReentrant external {
        assembly {
            return(0, 0)
        }
    }
}
```

In the above contract, it's very easy to miss that the contract enters a deadlock. The lock is never freed.

We should do control flow analysis for contracts with modifiers that has a "post" block and warn if there is a reachable assembly `return` or `stop`. Note: unlike a reachable `return`, a reachable `revert` is fine. Because the lock will be freed.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
