# [\#13672 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13672) `closed`: Workflow to comment on stale triaged issues

This PR adds a workflow to handle stale issues, fixing https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13615 item 2.

As the actions must be reusable between different repositories but it was requested that the automation exists in the same repo for easier maintenance (i.e., neither create a GH app nor a repo for all actions). I decided to use the composite actions feature of Github.
Thus, this workflow uses reusable actions to query issues using the [GitHub search API](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) through the GH CLI (i.e., any filter/search query that can be used in the search bar on the issues tab can also be used by the actions).

The workflow comments on any triaged issue that is stale for more than 14 days (default).
An issue is considered triaged if it has at least one label.
The workflow ignores issues with the label `waiting for more input` (maybe we can customize the `stale_issues` action to receive a list of labels to be ignored).
It has a `DRY_RUN` mode that only prints the url of stale issues.
The action can be triggered manually using `workflow_dispatch` for testing.

Currently, the workflow does not close the issues. We must discuss if this is desirable and what other labels should be ignored.

The `stale-issues` workflow can be modified to be a reusable workflow (i.e., triggered by `workflow_call` events), so it can be called by other repo (e.g. solc-js), or the `stale_issues` action can be called directly by the other repo, doing something like:
```yml
      - name: Get inactive open issues
        uses: ethereum/solidity/.github/actions/stale_issues@develop
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          period: 20
```

I would prefer having another repo with all reusable actions/workflow that we could share between the repos in the org. But maybe this PR can be a starting point.

By the way, why not use `actions/stale`? Do we need some features it does not provide?

I'd say let's keep that in Soldity repo for now and we can think about moving that to a separate repo if we end up having many of them. I'm not sure if we'll actually have that many so I would prefer not to do it prematurely.

Please rebase and integrate with the existing stale actions.

Closing this in favor of a simpler alternative: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13947
