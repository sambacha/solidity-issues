Execution of the EVM Assembly JSON import/export tests need ~20 minutes.

You got tons of `std::` qualifier usages in cpp files here by the way.

Also, changelog entry since this introduces a new input mode right?

So I see that #13576 is a dependency, but it looks like you've deleted (or renamed) `ASTImportTest.sh`; is it still a dependency, and how do you plan to resolve #13576 so it's aligned with this PR?

Also, if you rebase against develop, you can finally get them sweet sweet green builds.

Yeah, initially we had import/export tests only for the AST (`ASTImportTest.sh`). But with this PR we will have an additional kind of import/export tests for the EVM Assembly. So now the script will support AST & EVM Assembly import/export tests, that's why I just renamed it to `ImportExportTest.sh`.

In this PR the renaming is done in a single commit. But we could also rename the script later. It is then probably easier to read the PR.

I removed the syntax tests from the the evm asm reimport tests. The majority of the syntax tests are not compilable. Now it will only use the semantic tests. This reduces also the execution time to ~10 minutes.

Does this PR also cover everything from #11254?

EDIT by @aarlt:

In this PR I did not change the structure of the underlying parts. I only added some additional things that were needed to make it work, e.g. `modifierDepth`, `jumpType` and also `sourceList`. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12799

Iâ€™m not sure right now why I was not changing the underlying structure already. I think the plan was to have at least a basic working version - without bigger structural changes - potentially not breaking. So that we could do this later in a potentially breaking release. Sadly the whole PR took much more time. @chriseth maybe you remember?

Uups.. I just saw that I accidentally edited @cameel comment ðŸ˜… sorry

Needs rebase now that we merged the script refactor.

@cameel thx for your feedback! I totally agree with you! The idea was just to implement it like the AST import, but I did not receive any feedback on the structure before, so I thought it was ok. However, I added now `solidity::evmasm::AssemblyStack`, where it gets used directly inside `CommandLineInterface`. I just added support for combined json output, so that the test script is able to run correctly. I still need to do some cleanups, some output specific code is still missing. Also input verification is still not really done.

However, let me know what you think about the current structure and the `AssemblyStack`. Did you had something similar in your mind?

Yeah, completely understandable. Sorry that this PR was waiting for reviews so long.

> However, let me know what you think about the current structure and the `AssemblyStack`. Did you had something similar in your mind?

I only skimmed through it for now but looks exactly like what I wanted. Just `CompilerStack` should use it internally too because now we have some duplication between them. And I'd extract the changes to use it there and the new stack itself into a separate PR.

To make review smoother I already fixed some of the smaller stuff that I'd normally point out. I pushed that in a separate fixup commit, so you can take a look before squashing it.

I also extracted some of the tweaks you have here into #14145 so that we can review them separately and quickly merge into `develop`. No point going over them again each time this is reviewed.

#14145 is merged. You can now rebase on it.

I would really like to get this PR merged soon. I think I integrated all the feedback. I will squash all commits after the final review round.

Wow, this PR adds an extra 30 min to the CLI test runs. This [brings the CI running time back to ~1h](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity?branch=import-asm-json-updated&status=none&status=success)  :(

At the very least, the new CLI test should [get its own parallel run](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/.circleci/parallel_cli_tests.py#L6-L17). But that will speed it up only a tiny bit (like maybe ~3 min depending on how much the other tests it's grouped with take). IMO this is just too slow overall. We should either speed it up or parallelize it more before merging.

Just to keep priorities clear here - we absolutely need this merged **very soon**, preferably today so I think @r0qs should focus on the three must-haves I listed in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13673#pullrequestreview-1690945812 - unless of course someone finds something serious, like a bug.

For the other minor improvements and refactors - feel free to just push fixups directly. Or just leave them be for now to be potentially addressed in some follow-up cleanup PR. I already fixed a lot of these myself while reviewing this last week. All the big, structural problems, like the import being part of `CompilerStack` are fixed at this point and remaining ones IMO are not serious enough to block the PR.
