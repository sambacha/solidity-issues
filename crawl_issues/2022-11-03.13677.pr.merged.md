This PR fixes the `welcome-external-pr` workflow to detect team members properly. The previous version did not handle pagination and consequently could produce false negatives, as can be seen here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13675#issuecomment-1301045747
The pagination was removed since it does not make sense for the size of the Solidity team, and a better endpoint was used, as suggested by @ekpyron.

Rebase for that green build please.
