# [\#13678 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13678) `closed`: Data location not enforced between abstract contract and implementation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621705?u=21fd615579f5de92577292c69afe808532a4951c&v=4" width="50">[decanus](https://github.com/decanus) opened issue at [2022-11-03 13:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13678):

Given the following function signature in an abstract contract:

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        uint256,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes memory /* data */
    ) internal virtual;
```

We would expect that the following code not compile:

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        uint256,
        address,
        uint256,
        bytes calldata /* data */
    ) internal override { }
```

However it does, and when overriding it skews with the values of the previous parameters. The easiest way to prevent this mistake is to not allow changing the storage location.

Are you using the latest compiler? This could be a serious issue with our previous fix, but it's more likely that you're running into this bug that has already been fixed in 0.8.14:
- [Bug Concerning Data Location during Inheritance](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/05/17/data-location-inheritance-bug/)
- #10900
