## Description


I'm a developer of the [gigahorse](https://github.com/nevillegrech/gigahorse-toolchain) binary lifter and I was looking at recently deployed contracts for which our tool reports a high number of unreachable blocks. I came across contracts that had lots of dead code in their runtime bytecode.

Mapping these blocks back to their source locations I found that the dead code originated from library methods only called during the contract's construction. A past [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13349) suggests that this is not the intended behavior. In addition private/internal methods declared on the contract or one of its super-contracts and called only during construction are not part of the runtime bytecode.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.17
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): london
- Operating system: ubuntu 20.04

## Steps to Reproduce

Minmal example:

```solidity
// Taken from OZ's Address
library MinimalAddress {

    function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly { size := extcodesize(account) }
        return size > 0;
    }
}

contract HasDeadCode {
    address public impl;

    constructor (address _implementation) {
        impl = _implementation;
        require(MinimalAddress.isContract(_implementation));
    }
}

contract NoDeadCode {
    address public impl;

    constructor (address _implementation) {
        impl = _implementation;
        require(isContract(_implementation));
    }

    function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
        uint256 size;
        // solhint-disable-next-line no-inline-assembly
        assembly { size := extcodesize(account) }
        return size > 0;
    }
}

```

The runtime bytecodes of the above without optimizations will be the following (issue persists with `--optimize` and different numbers of rounds):

`HasDeadCode`:
```

```

`NoDeadCode`:
```

```

For contract `HasDeadCode` block `0x6b` implements the `isContract` library method and is dead code in the bytecode.

Partial dissasembly output:
```
   0x6b: JUMPDEST  
   0x6c: PUSH1     0x0
   0x6e: DUP1      
   0x6f: DUP3      
   0x70: EXTCODESIZE
   0x71: SWAP1     
   0x72: POP       
   0x73: PUSH1     0x0
   0x75: DUP2      
   0x76: GT        
   0x77: SWAP2     
   0x78: POP       
   0x79: POP       
   0x7a: SWAP2     
   0x7b: SWAP1     
   0x7c: POP       
   0x7d: JUMP      
```

Same issue is not present in contract `NoDeadCode`.

Just finally getting around to look at reports that have fallen through the grid so far: I can confirm this and this indeed looks strange.
The runtime assembly of ``HasDeadCode`` with ``--optimize --asm`` indeed contains a tag for the implementation of ``isContract``, which is not referenced - so it *should* be eliminated by the libevmasm optimizer, but indeed isn't.

via-IR is not affected, but this is still something that'd be worthwhile to fix on the libevmasm level, depending on what causes it there.

Here's a short reproduction:
```solidity
library L {
    function destruct() internal {
        selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
    }
}
contract C {
    constructor() {
        if (msg.sender == address(0xdead)) {
            L.destruct();
        }
    }
}
```

`solc --bin-runtime --no-cbor-metadata --optimize` produces

Here's a brief description on why this is happening:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e50d56517bcd1513dbeee82d83d209fe23395bd5/libevmasm/JumpdestRemover.cpp#L34

The `_tagsReferencedFromOutside` will contain a reference to this tag (`tag_2`) in the following example:

```asm
======= /tmp/first.sol:C =======
EVM assembly:
  mstore(0x40, 0x80)
  callvalue
  dup1
  iszero
  tag_1
  jumpi
  0x00
  dup1
  revert
tag_1:
  pop
  not(0xdeac)
  caller
  add
  tag_5
  jumpi
  tag_5
  or(tag_0_2, shl(0x20, tag_6))
  0x20
  shr
  jump	// in
tag_5:
  jump(tag_7)
tag_6:
  caller
  selfdestruct
tag_7:
  dataSize(sub_0)
  dup1
  dataOffset(sub_0)
  0x00
  codecopy
  0x00
  return
stop

sub_0: assembly {
      mstore(0x40, 0x80)
      0x00
      dup1
      revert
    tag_2:
      caller
      selfdestruct
}
```

There are a couple of ways to deal with this.
- An elegant fix would be if we can optimize the sequence `or(tag_0_2, shl(0x20, tag_6)); 0x20; shr` into `tag_6`. For this, we need to encode that `tags` have at most 2 / 3 bytes.
- Fix the codegen so that this `or(...)` is not generated in this case.

---

Maybe adding the rule `SHL(N, OR(A, B)) => OR(SHL(N, A), SHL(N, B))` might do the trick.

Is this going to be fixed in the next release of Solidity?

Yes, very likely.

Great, thanks.
