## Description

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

interface Foo {}

interface Bar {
    event MyEvent(Foo indexed indexed indexed some);
}
```

The above contract is _compiled_ while my expectation was to get a parse error. Other tools are failing to parse such source. For an instance, `solidity-coverage` HardHat plugin is failing on it. Is it intended to use multiple `indexed` entries for event arguments? Also is it documented somewhere?

## Environment

This is reproducible in Remix IDE.

## Steps to Reproduce

Run code sample from "Description" section in Remix IDE.

Regards.

I don't think it's intended. Looks like a bug to me. We don't allow that with any other modifier.

As @cameel said, there is already a PR addressing this issue, so it not up for taking by anyone else.
