# [\#13684 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13684) `open`: AST reimport fails for inline assembly with uninitialized variable declarations
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`, `low effort`, `low impact`, `must have eventually`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-11-07 20:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13684):

An attempt to import an AST produced by the compiler fails when the original source code contains an inline assembly block with a variable declaration without an initializer:

`test.sol`
```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public pure {
        assembly {
            let x
        }
    }
}
```
```bash
solc test.sol --combined-json ast | solc --import-ast -
```
```
Failed to import AST: Expected "nodeType" to be of type string!
```

This is reproducible all the way down to 0.6.2, when the `--import-ast` option was introduced, though before 0.8.0 the error message was different and it seems to be failing for a different reason (even examples that work on 0.8.x fail on those versions)
```
Failed to import AST: Top-level node should be a 'SourceUnit'
```
