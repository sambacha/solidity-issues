Just out of curiosity, how are you/we benchmarking this runtime? Are the results available to all via some CI job, or do you run it locally on your machine?

@ekpyron this is more efficient than storing in the AST since it only needs to be done once per YulString.

For reference: result from chat: eventually it makes sense to change the main data of ``Literal``s to ``u256`` (merely keeping a string as optional formatting hint and resetting that on any value change), but we'll keep it at the cache here for now.
