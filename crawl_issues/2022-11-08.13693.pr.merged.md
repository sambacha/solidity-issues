# [\#13693 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13693) `merged`: Resolved `FunctionDefinition` instead of `FunctionCall` in CFG
**Labels**: `refactor`

Small refactor PR extracted from #12362.

With the addition of custom operators a `FunctionCall` will no longer be the only node in the AST that can represent a function call. Instead of adding node node types to the graph or treating everything as a generic `ASTNode`, it's better to store a definition instead - because that's really the only thing we need from that node. For this to work, the virtual calls need to be resolved tough.

Since this may lead to misleading function flows, if no contract definition is passed, maybe we should remove the default ``nullptr`` for ``_contract`` from ``ControlFlowBuilder::createFunctionFlow`` (explicitly passing ``nullptr`` in the free function case)?

Sure. Good idea. Default removed.

But just wanted to note that  `ControlFlowBuilder` already uses `m_contract` to resolve virtual modifiers - so forgetting to pass in a contract wasn't harmless before this PR either :)
