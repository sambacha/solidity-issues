Add "original" field to storage_value to precise track "dirty" state of
a storage slot as defined in EIP-2200. In case a current storage value
is restored to original (after multiple modifications in a single
transaction), the storage slot is not considered "dirty" any more.
Previously, we only had a bool dirty flag to model this and a storage
slot was always considered "dirty" after first modification.

This allows https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13532 to land cleanly.

@cameel @ekpyron this is the last blocker for the EVMC upgrade.
