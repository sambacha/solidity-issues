`soltest` steps are failing, I'm assuming you didn't update all of the tests?

Yes, it takes like 2 hrs to run it locally, and will need to rebase this anyhow once the dependencies are merged.

Ah neat, so I see that @cameel approved https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13537, which means you can resolve conflicts on [this one](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13532) so we can merge it, and then you can rebase this one so we can merge it, and so on and so forth? :D

@axic, dependencies are merged, so is this good to go?

Good to go from my perspective.

Needed to update tests due to rebasing over the optimizor changes which were merged.
