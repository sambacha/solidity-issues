Since the dependency has been merged in, I've resolved the conflicts and rebased, so the PR should now be ready for review.

Please note the last commit is there to show the test is indeed run.

Maybe we should also update the description of `difficulty()` in Yul docs as a part of this PR?

Perhaps would leave this to the other PR when the changes are actually applied?

But I meant the changes that already took effect with the merge. I.e. the fact that it does not really return difficulty now (and that it depends on the underlying EVM rather than the EVM version set in the compiler).

After checking it out locally I spotted a few more places where the later EVM versions were missing. So I added them. That's already in the PR now. Some of those were in the fuzzer and tests so let's see if that doesn't break the CI.

@cameel yay, it is fixed now, let's merge :)
