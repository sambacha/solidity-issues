This is the leftover task of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6727 :  Improve LoadResolver to know that memory is zero initially

We could also improve it so that it knows that storage is zero in the constructor.

Additionally, we should also improve the way keccak knowledge is cleared on memory writes.

How much is this expected to improve things? I guess not much judging by how it was left hanging for so long?

Adding the knowledge that storage is zero in the constructor could make quite a big improvement especially for packed storage. We might have to drag this through into function calls (especially when they are only called once).

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
