Hey there - great docs! I work for Alchemy and we see that one of the most frequent things developers ask when learning web3 / smart contracts is what to do once they write their first smart contract. Based on these queries, I added in blockchain api providers as well as Goerli faucets to help developers understand how to deploy their solidity based smart contracts onto the Goerli testnet and Ethereum mainnet as I didn't see this in the docs. Love what you guys do for the ecosystem, lmk if there's a better spot to put these :) thanks!

Hi @shelleyolivia, 

Thanks for contributing and for the kudos!

Unfortunately, the two sections you are suggesting to add are out of scope for the rather lean "Resources" section of the Solidity docs.

I will close this PR due to the following reasons:
- The "Resources" section aims to list resources that are directly relevant to people using Solidity: IDEs, editor integrations and tools. Everything else that is useful or nice to know, like coding tutorials or guides, but covered by other good resources already, is not included in this section. This is especially relevant for topics covered well by the ethereum.org developer portal.
- Blockchain API Providers are well covered by ethereum.org, see the ["Nodes as a service" section](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/#popular-node-services).
- Testnets and available faucets are well covered by ethereum.org, see the ["Networks" section](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets).

Last but not least, just for the sake of completeness, I'd like to point out that Goerli should not be used as a default testnet for app developers (it's the recommended default testnet for testing of validating and staking). The recommended testnet for application developers is [Sepolia](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#ethereum-testnets).
