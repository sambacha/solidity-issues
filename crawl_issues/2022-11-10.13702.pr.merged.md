This is ready for review, but would be nice to have some more benchmarks.

The last two commits actually degrade performance on the Optimizer.sol example. Need to investigate.

This needs to be tighter integrated in the caller: Whenever we call one of the functions of KnowledgeBase in a loop, we should save at least one lookup.

This was fuzzed a while back iirc. Will fuzz the latest code nevertheless and report findings here if any.
