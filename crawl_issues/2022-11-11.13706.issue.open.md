# [\#13706 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13706) `open`: The maximum integer allowed in version pragma is platform-dependent
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `low effort`, `low impact`, `must have eventually`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-11-11 00:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13706):

The code checking if integers used in `pragma solidity` uses `unsigned int` as the underlying type and relies on its overflow behavior, which means that the range depends on what platform the compiler was built for: [`unsigned` can be 16- or 32-bit long](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types).

For example this pragma may or may not be allowed, depending on the platform:
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0 <=65536;
```

The code using such a pragma would pass source verification on some platforms but not on others.

To fix this we should use a type with a platform-independent size, either `uint16_t` or `uint32_t`.

I think this is a bug, ~though it could also be seen as a breaking change~. EDIT: Actually not breaking if we use `uint32_t` - then all the code that used to compile would still compile.
