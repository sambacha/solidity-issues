There are errors in the function `void ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(If const& _if)` and function `void ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(Switch const& _switch)` when calculating CFG.
1. In the function `void ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(If const& _if)`, the `if.condition` block is not the same block as the `if.then` block. The original code is calculated as one same block.
2. The switch.expression block are not the same block as all the cases block in cases, the original code is calculated as one same block. This can cause some potential problems during the optimization phase.

Thank you for your pull request!
I have to admit that I don't fully understand your change nor the description. Can you provide a simple test case where the bug is present?
Please not that the first thing `ControlFlowBuilder::ControlFlowBuilder(Block const& _ast)` does is create a new node, and the current code relies on that behaviour. Since blocks / curly braces are not optional in Yul (as they are in Solidity), I think this already causes the behaviour you are trying to achieve with your change.
Is that true?

Thanks for your reply. I got your point, I think there may be some ambiguity between us.
**I'm sorry that in the previous comment I was talking about “block” while actually, it should be “node”.**

Generally, before visiting a Yul Block, we must assign `m_currentNode `a value, as `ControlFlowBuilder::ControlFlowBuilder(Block const& _ast)` does, if we don't do this, the block being visited will have the same `m_currentNode` as the old one, which is incorrect.
In void `ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(If const& _if)` and `void ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(Switch const& _switch)`, the current code didn't do this.

For example,
```
{
  let x := 0
  if x
  {
    x := 1
  }
  x := 2
}
```
currently, 2 nodes(n1, n2) will be generated after `ControlFlowBuilder` phase.

n1 covers `{let x := 0, if.cond.expr x, x := 1}` 3 items
successors [n2, n2]

n2 covers `{x := 2}` 1 item
successors []

I think it's wrong.
First, In n1, no matter what x is, the {x:=1} can be reached, which doesn't add up.
Second, n1 has two successors, which are both n2. It doesn't make sense too.

The same thing happens in `void ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(Switch const& _switch)`.

So I proposed a PR yesterday.
In my code, we should generate 3 nodes(n1, n2, n3) regarding this piece of code.
n1 covers `{let x:=0 , if.cond.expr x}` 2 items
successors [n2, n3]

n2 covers `{x := 1}` 1 item
successors [n3]

n3 covers `{x := 2}` 1 item
successors []

It's the constructor, `ControlFlowBuilder::ControlFlowBuilder(Block const& _ast)`, not the visit, `ControlFlowBuilder::operator()(Block const& _ast)` that already has the ``m_currentNode = newNode();``, though.
So the problem may in fact be genuine.

I'm actually wondering - if this checks out - if this can have any serious effects.

@ChrisXXXXXXX Thanks for a more detailed explanation. I think I understand your point now. Yeah, we don't explicitly add nodes for the `if`/`case` bodies themselves unless there's actually something interesting inside (a function call, nested `if`, etc.).

But the question is: does that actually cause real issues? Can you show a test case where that actually breaks something in the optimizer? The thing is that this particular CFG is primarily used for detecting which flows revert, terminate or continue and seems to only track the bits relevant to that use case. For this reason I think this omission might have been intentional. We have a more full-featured CFG in [`libyul/backends/evm/ControlFlowGraph.h`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/backends/evm/ControlFlowGraph.h) that we use in other cases.

I think it's fine if the CFG is really only used for side-effects. If the body has a `revert()`, `stop()` or a function call, it does get a node. In the case shown above the double edge seems weird but harmless to me.

BTW, I initially started analyzing the other, more full-featured graph and I was surprised why I get the same graphviz output with and without this PR :) So since I already generated it, here's how that full CFG looks like in this case:

@cameel 
I'm still wondering if there are cases in which this is a problem... resp. why it's *not* :-). What happens currently, if the ``if`` contains a ``leave`` as first instruction... then the current version of the CFG will assume that the function always leaves early? What if it then afterwards ``return``s and this is not taken into account in redundant store eliminator? I haven't constructed an actually buggy case yet, but I'm also not yet convinced that there isn't any :-).

We visit `leave` explicitly and add a node for it so I think this case is not a problem.

I think that as long as every control structure/instruction/syntax element is always either skipped or has a single end node that's the starting point for the next one, we should be fine.

But ok, I did not analyze it that deeply so there could be something I'm not seeing. Thinking up more test cases and increasing coverage is never a bad idea.

@ChrisXXXXXXX After discussing this with @ekpyron, we decided that it's a good idea to accept this PR, even if the current state does not seem broken. That way the graph is less weird and there's less risk there's a problem we're not seeing.

But before that - could you try to come up with some corner cases here and cover them with tests in `test/libyul/controlFlowSideEffects` or general optimizer tests (with optimizer steps that could be affected)? Even if these cases are not broken, better coverage would give us more confidence that the CFG works correctly.

Thanks for accepting this PR, it's a great idea and will help avoid potential security issues. 
At present, I have no extreme case to give, I will continue to pay attention, and once I find an extreme case, I will add it here immediately.

@ChrisXXXXXXX These really don't need to be *that* extreme. Just a few code snippets where we run into the case you're fixing here. The one with `leave` mentioned by @ekpyron would be a good one, but it shouldn't really be hard to come up with more.
