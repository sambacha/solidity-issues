First version of a structured concrete design document for generics.

This may also already involve defining weaker transitions in the type system, like introducing tuple types as first-citizen types and tying data locations to types instead of variables, and staging those for implementation. This preliminary transition of the type system may be split into a non-breaking part and a breaking part to be scheduled for the breaking release planned later in the year.
