## Abstract

Solidity could allow to have `storage` references in `memory` structures or even `memory` arrays.

## Motivation

Sometimes it is handy to have memory structure with some storage refs. Now we can use this trick, uncomfortable but works:
```solidity
type DataPtr is uint256;

function get(DataPtr ptr) internal pure returns(Data storage data) {
    assembly {
        data.slot := ptr
    }
}
```

## Specification

It would be convenient to have `storage` refs in `memory` struct by allowing following syntax:

```solidity
struct Data {
    // ...
}

struct Object {
    Data storage data; // <- allow storage keyword here
    bytes32 context;
}
```

Yes, we plan on associating data locations with the type in the future, not with the variable declaration (which is currently the case). The same goes for calldata references in memory. Just the nonsensical combinations like memory references in storage should remain invalid. Not entirely sure we have an issue for that yet, though.

@ekpyron glad to hear that this kind of functionality was already planned

As for some more implementation details on this: for nested reference types, the outermost data location should become the implicit default data location for the inner types, so e.g. ``uint[][] memory x;`` would be short for ``uint[] memory [] memory x;`` (while after solving this issue we'll also have ``uint[] calldata [] memory x;``). Similarly, for struct members the default, non-mentioned data location means inheriting the location from the struct itself. On the other hand variable declarations of variables of reference type will still have to specify the outermost data location explicitly. This way we should be able to pull this of in a non-breaking backwards compatible way.

Furthermore, in the longer term, this will be a prerequisite for a generics-ready type system, i.e. it's related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13725 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/869
