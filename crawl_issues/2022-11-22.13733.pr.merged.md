**Labels**: `EOF`

Intentionally has no changelog entry, no docs and no CLI help, since we consider it internal and only for testing for now.
Similarly, I'd say this can live without extensive CLI option validation and command line tests for now, since we'll likely still change the behaviour anyways.

This should make the eof version available everywhere except in ``Assembly`` itself, which I'd do with one of the next steps (the basic container format, while keeping in mind that we need some function abstraction).
The parts in testing is still a bit messy, but we can fix it properly once we have CI setup with evmone binaries supporting EOF.

We might also make the yul dialects depend on the EOF version, depending on what opcode changes we get in the end.

Most of this will be subject to change before we reach a final version.

~~Ah, I missed a few fuzzer cases, will fix soon.~~ Should be fixed now.

Is this really going to change? Isn't validation basically just "evm version > paris"?

I mean, I think that in terms of reviewing, it would be much easier to have them now in a single PR rather than remember later what's missing.

It's still unclear which EVM version will actually introduce it. And I mean - it's not *actually* producing EOF right now anyways, so this PR will always be incomplete :-). And if I add a ``evm version > paris`` check now, I can't really run it anymore without adding shanghai as evm version... for which it would be nice to know what'll make it into shanghai, which is unclear yet :-)... so in that sense: for now we *want* to be able to run this in what will later be invalid combinations. Also not quite sure yet whether ``--ir`` will be affected by eof version or only ``--ir-optimized`` or even only everything after that, so we'll only really see which combinations of options to allow, once the rest is done.
So I'd say for an undocumented, experimental flag, that isn't to be released as just this, this should be fine :-).
