# [\#13739 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13739) `merged`: Code reshuffling before custom operators
**Labels**: `refactor`

Another refactor PR extracted from #12362.

A bunch of trivial changes that move code around, extract common helpers, add helper variables or rename stuff. They don't add much on their own but they're still not wrong even without the operator PR and I want them merged separately to reduce the size of that PR. There are no functional changes here so I think this bit is also easier to review separately than mixed with all the actual changes.
