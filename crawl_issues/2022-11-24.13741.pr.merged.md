# [\#13741 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13741) `merged`: Consistent terminology for attached/bound functions
**Labels**: `refactor`

Another refactor PR extracted from #12362.

In the operators PR the new form of `using for` is referred to as "binding an operator to a function". This makes the meaning of `FunctionType::bound()` ambiguous so in the PR we decided to rename it to `boundToType()` to clarify.

We also noticed that the way we refer to binding functions is not consistent in docs (we sometimes say "bind" or "bound" and sometimes "attach" or "attached").

Finally, there's a small clarification that only *internal* library functions can be used with `using for`.

UPDATE 2022-12-02: We decided to change it the other way around. I.e. replace "bound" with "attached".

Is [this](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/SyntaxChecker.cpp#L418) or [this](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/DeclarationTypeChecker.cpp#L488) relevant?

Changing to draft for now because I need to change the PR. After discussing it with @ekpyron it turned out that the "bound" terminology is actually wrong. It was about "first argument of a function being bound" rather than "function being bound to a type". We decided to change it to "attached".

This is now ready for review again. I changed the terminology from "bind" to "attach".

Note that there are many more changes now. The "bound function" terminology was quite pervasive. It was even in the changelog as far back as 0.2.0 (2015-12-02).
