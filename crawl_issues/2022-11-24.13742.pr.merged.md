Re ran the `ext_benchmarks` step, but it's still failing, so not flaky. Needs to be looked into.

@nikola-matic The reason it's failing is probably because the last run on `develop` failed. `develop` is the base branch here and it tries to get benchmarks from it.

Kinda weird, because I changed this at some point not to fail if base branch as no benchmarks. Still, I reran CI on `develop` - if `c_ext_benchmarks` succeeds there, we can rerun here and it will probably succeed too.

Ah OK, that makes perfect sense, and the develop run should now hopefully pass since the CI seems to be back to normal.
