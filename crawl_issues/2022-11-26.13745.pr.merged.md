# [\#13745 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13745) `merged`: Close stale issues

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2022-11-26 00:56](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13745):

This PR addresses some of the comments made here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13615#issuecomment-1325635999 and in the matrix channel.

It sets the `days-before-issue-close` to 0, forcing issues labeled with `stale` to be immediately closed.
The `days-before-issue-stale` is irrelevant in this case since @NunoFilipeSantos manually added the stale labels, and the action will have up to 180 days to close everything until it starts to label new stale issues.
As the action has a limit of operations per run due to the GitHub rate limit, not all issues will be closed in a single run.
The action excludes stale issues that also have any of the following labels: `bug`, `roadmap`, `must have` and `must have eventually`.
The closed issues will be labeled: `closed-due-inactivity`.
`DEBUG` is currently enabled.

Please see the changes in the first commit here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/7ff369a752b07c97b1c495f506f94d22632cf6e2 since I also renamed the action to a more generic name.

Also, a general remark: it's better to put the rename in a separate commit. If you rename and modify the file in the same commit, git may not recognize that it's still the same file and the diff is harder to read (you just see one whole file deleted and the other added instead of having them compared).

I saw that you initially had it that way and it would have been ok to keep it. You don't always have to squash the PR into a single commit. It should be as many commits as there are logical changes. It's just that we want review fixes incorporated into the original commits.

I reverted the changes and remove the commit the renamed the file ;)
If everything is fine now, I can squash the commits and create another PR that rename the file.

Also, the debug is set to `true`. Should we just set it to `false` and let it play out? ;P

Up to @NunoFilipeSantos. If you're asking me, I'd rather be careful since this will hit a lot of issues so if it goes wrong, it'll cause havoc.

I'm going to merge it since it's still in debug mode. You can now prepare a PR to flip the switch so that @NunoFilipeSantos can do that at will, either after inspecting the results or right away.

Please don't do it right away. Indeed was good not to disable the debug since the action considered the most recent issues/prs first and not only the ones already labeled. I changed that. See here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13758
