## Abstract

The double negative seems to read incorrect.

>  that does not keep track of the keys that were assigned a non-zero value

should be

>  that does not keep track of the keys that were assigned a zero value

No, it's correct. Mappings do not keep track of their keys, and this includes keys with non-zero value (i.e. the ones that you would expect to be affected by `delete`). That's why using `delete` on a mapping does not clear the values.

Thank you for the clarification!
