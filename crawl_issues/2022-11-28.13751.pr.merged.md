# [\#13751 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13751) `merged`: Fix internal error in multiple wrong options for SMTChecker natspec

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2022-11-28 16:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13751):

Fix https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13732

The ideal fix would be adding source location to DocTags so we could point exactly to the wrong tag, but that's quite a lot of overhead. This is a quite niche feature and the current error reporting in this PR should be enough.
