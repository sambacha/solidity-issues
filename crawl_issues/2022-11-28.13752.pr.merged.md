Part of #13719 

Current benchmarks:
```

    100% (15.381 s)

  2.326% (0.124451 s): UnusedPruner

 34.140% (1.826744 s): CommonSubexpressionEliminator
--------------------------------------
    100% (5.351 s)

33.8s
```

So relative to develop this changes overall execution time from 42.7 to 33.8 seconds.
The relevant components change from:
```
 2.675% (0.558851 s): UnusedStoreEliminator
29.865% (6.238317 s): UnusedAssignEliminator
-
 2.150% (0.187418 s): UnusedStoreEliminator
36.591% (3.189325 s): UnusedAssignEliminator
```
to
```
1.701% (0.261641 s): UnusedAssignEliminator
4.936% (0.759197 s): UnusedStoreEliminator
-
1.075% (0.057502 s): UnusedAssignEliminator
1.680% (0.089905 s): UnusedStoreEliminator
```

It is not yet clear to me why the UnusedStoreEliminator gets more expensive in the first contract, but I think we can live with the change. Maybe the knowledge base PR will fix it again.

Looks like an 8+ second improvement for the `chains.sol` benchmark, so consistent with your tests. Good stuff!

@chriseth by the way, what are you benchmarking this against, `chains.sol`?

@bshastry Did we fuzz this already? If not, it'd be a good target as well. On a completely independent note - did you ever figure out why it took the large AWS machine to find the last redundant store eliminator bug :-)? Just since this touches the same component again.

Yes, this was also fuzzed without any new finding but I can repeat it in case changes have been made. The main reason the last redundant store eliminator bug was difficult to find was due to the low probability of generating a test case that contained a call to a function that conditionally reverted sandwiched between stores to the same slot. Something like

```
{
  sstore(0, 1)
  f(calldataload(0))
  sstore(0, 2)
  function f(x) {
    if (gt(x, calldataload(1))) { leave }
    revert(0, 0)
  }
}
```

Now there is a custom mutation that adds store to zero (simulating storage overwrites) but there is no mutation that specifically generates a function that conditionally reverts, so I guess the time may be attributed to generating such a function and issuing a call that would be sandwiched between such sstores. I vaguely remember that another pre-requisite for the bug to manifest was that the function is *not* inlined. That makes it a little less likely as well.

Rebased.

I'd say this would even deserve a changelog entry, if it didn't have any observable effect - but since it does change the behaviour in nested loops, it definitely needs one.
