> Don't see how this relates to chain assignments but it is not wrong.

The `assignment` function which does the `switch` on the AST types calls the function that is modified in this PR to see if this actually refers to a variable. Because the contract in the buggy test was wrapped in a tuple `(C).x`, this function did not see it as a state variable, but rather as a generic `MemberAccess`. The added cleanup allows the function to read `(C).x => C.x => x`, which then correctly associates it with the state variable.
