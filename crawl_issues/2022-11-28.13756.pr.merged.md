I checked the logs, and it seems to be working as intended. One thing to keep in mind is that the closing action does not consider the exempt rules, only the labeling action does. So, for example, if an issue was labeled as `stale` manually and had the `bug` label, it would be closed anyway. For the purpose of this initial PR this should be fine (i.e., initial cleanup of ancient issues)

I rebased it, by the way.

It _is_ fine. Go ahead.

We had 28 bugs labeled stale though. Those would have been closed. I removed the `stale` label from them now.
