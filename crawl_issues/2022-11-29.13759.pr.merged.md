# [\#13759 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13759) `merged`: Add `block.prevrandao` as alias for `block.difficulty`

Supersedes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13531. Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13512.

This PR is an attempt to finish the work started in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13531. It reuses part of the solution proposed there but ignores the renaming of the `Instruction` enum.

As both opcodes share the same bytecode for different EVMs, the EVM version determine whether the compiler outputs one or the other in the `instructionInfo` function. The table below illustrate the expected behavior:


| EVM Version  | Changes                                                             |
| :------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EVM < PARIS  | `difficulty`: builtin and reserved identifier (not changed). Not allowed as user-defined identifier.<br>`prevrandao`: not reserved. Allowed as user-defined identifier. |
| EVM >= PARIS | `difficulty`: reserved identifier (warning, behave as prevrandao).<br>`prevrandao`: builtin and reserved identifier. Not allowed as user-defined identifier. |
| EVM >= PARIS (0.9.0) | `difficulty`: not reserved. Allowed as user-defined identifier.<br>`prevrandao`: builtin and reserved identifier. Not allowed as user-defined identifier.|

`block.difficulty` and `block.prevrandao` are allowed in **all** versions with their appropriate warnings.

I only had a quick look over this so far, but this looks generally good! I think we can still reduce the number of cases, in which we have to drag along the evm version a bit and switch between passing it along and storing it in some cases, but most of it looks good already!

Testing failures seem mostly or entirely SMT related bugs independent of this PR.

Ok, I think we're getting there, but we're still missing test for the names in the evmasm output and for the opcode names in the output.

I'd suggest to use command line tests for that, compiling e.g.
```
ontract C {
    constructor() payable {
        uint x = block.difficulty;
        assembly {
            sstore(0, x)
            stop()
        }
    }
    fallback() external payable { assembly { stop() } }
}
```
with
``--no-cbor-metadata --via-ir --optimize --opcodes --asm --debug-info none --evm-version london``
and
``--no-cbor-metadata --via-ir --optimize --opcodes --asm --debug-info none --evm-version paris``
and the same for ``block.prevrandao``.

That should produce pretty minimal evmasm and opcode output containing the respective names.

Only some very minor comments and a question left. We can probably merge it soon (we should squash the 66+ commits then, though :-))

Yes, related with the smtCheckerTests, I'm adding them right now in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13883 because SMT tests only run for the default EVM version.

For the `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/state/block_difficulty.sol` it already run for EVM < paris and there is the `block_difficulty_post_paris.sol` to test `difficulty` in EVM > paris as well the `block_prevrandao_pre_paris.sol` and `block_prevrandao.sol` for the `prevrandao` state checks.

For the syntaxTests in questions indeed it is missing the `magic_block` for prevrandao and EVM >= paris. I will add it.
