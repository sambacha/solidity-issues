That's what I expected would happen with legacy, and why I asked the other day on the channel if the time comparison was taking the compilation results into account.

We have `set -euo pipefail` and the compilation failure causes the script to fail (we should extend the `trap` to catch `ERR` as well, since we don't clean up temp files in this case as well), so we'll need to decide what to do in these situations, i.e. allow the script to continue or not.

Oh, we still have to sort out the failure @nikola-matic reported above.

Just checked and I'm getting that too (with the 0.8.17 release binary). And the optimized running time via IR is not even that slow: 7 seconds. For a fair comparison we do need all these benchmarks to compile via IR, right?

Yes, the benchmark is not too bad, but I think it's still good to have it to see what the worst component is if the runtime is not that bad. It could also be that this benchmark gets considerably worse when the other gets better.

So, @chriseth addressed most of the issues, however, running this locally, I noticed that the output on failure is not great, i.e. for `OptimizorClub` legacy compilation, this is what it looks like:
```
=======================================================
            OptimizorClub.sol
-------------------------------------------------------
legacy pipeline took Command exited with non-zero status 1
6.23 seconds to execute.
via-ir pipeline took 41.31 seconds to execute.
=======================================================
```
Since we have `set -eo pipefail`, it means I can't catch the exit code of the legacy compilation run, so instead, we just let it fail silently with `|| true`. Due to this, I check the result output file to see if it contains the `Command exited with ....` statement, which would indicate failure, and then change the output message accordingly:
```
=======================================================
            OptimizorClub.sol
-------------------------------------------------------
legacy pipeline took FAILED seconds to execute.
via-ir pipeline took 43.20 seconds to execute.
=======================================================
``` 
It's not great, but better than it was - and honestly, I think setting `-e pipefail` was probably not the way to go, since we expect failures to occur and want to process them accordingly.
I also then piped `stderr` to a temp file, whose contents I print at the end of the benchmark run so as not to pollute the actual benchmark results with warnings and errors in-between each executing `*.sol` file. The caveat here is that we don't get the pretty colour output when we pipe it to a file and then to tty instead of to tty directly. Final form of the output is below.
```
=======================================================
            chains.sol
-------------------------------------------------------
legacy pipeline took 0.96 seconds to execute.
via-ir pipeline took 331.51 seconds to execute.
=======================================================
=======================================================
            OptimizorClub.sol
-------------------------------------------------------
legacy pipeline took FAILED seconds to execute.
via-ir pipeline took 43.20 seconds to execute.
=======================================================


=======================================================
Warnings and errors generated during run:
=======================================================

@cameel, please give it a look over when you get the time; I've added this as a separate commit, so it can be reverted completely if needed.

> The caveat here is that we don't get the pretty colour output when we pipe it to a file and then to tty instead of to tty directly.

You can use the `--color` flag to force colored output even without TTY.

> Since we have set `-eo pipefail`, it means I can't catch the exit code of the legacy compilation run, so instead, we just let it fail silently with `|| true`.

We typically work around it by wrapping the command in `set +x`, `set -x`. Still not pretty, but more reliable than grepping the output for error messages and we get to keep `set -e` for all other parts of the script.

> I think setting `-e pipefail` was probably not the way to go, since we expect failures to occur and want to process them accordingly.

Fine to drop it if when it interferes with what you want to do. `-euo pipefail` is a good default but all of these have some quirks and there are situations were you don't want them (i.e. `pipefail` does not mix well with `grep`, which outputs the number of matches via its status code).

> It's not great, but better than it was

Yeah. Well, it gets the job done so I think it's acceptable here. The worst part is that with errors silenced it's easy to miss when we start getting them for a different reason.

Ideally, we'd just require the contracts to compile via legacy. I played with this contract a bit and actually managed to fix it for legacy with a very simple tweak: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13760#discussion_r1038250063 - maybe with that we could just drop this error silencing after all?
