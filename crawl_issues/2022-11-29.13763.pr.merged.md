The docs should specify that members `.push()` and `.pop()` only exist for dynamically sized-arrays. This is done later in the section under the "Array Members" subheading but could cause some initial confusion when not mentioned earlier in the section.

Come to think of it, could further specify that this applies exclusively to dynamic *storage* arrays. What do we think?
