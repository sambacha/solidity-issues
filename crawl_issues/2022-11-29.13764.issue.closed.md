## Description
Private library functions are normally not accessible outside of the library. `L.f` is actually an invalid expression, both inside and outside of the library, when `f` is private. It appears, however, that it's possible to bypass this restriction by binding a private function to a type at file-level.

This is a bug. Private library functions should not be usable in `using for` outside of the library where they are defined.

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
library L {
    function privateFunction(uint) private {}
}

using {L.privateFunction} for uint;

contract C {
    function test() public {
        uint x;
        x.privateFunction();    // No errors
        //L.privateFunction(x); // Error: Member "privateFunction" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(library L).
    }
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.17 (`develop`)
