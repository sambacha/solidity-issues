# [\#13766 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13766) `merged`: Fix spurious unreachable warning in `SemVerMatcher`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2022-11-29 22:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13766):

This is the same false-positive as #13087, but at a new spot. Probably introduced by the recently merged #12797. It only happens in Debug mode and we don't have a CI run for that.

Apparently this is still not fixed in GCC. My original report was closed as a duplicate but it's tracked as [bug#104787](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=104787).

### Errors
This is what I'm getting locally without this workaround:
```
test/libsolidity/SemVerMatcher.cpp: In function ‘solidity::langutil::SemVerMatchExpression solidity::frontend::test::SemVerMatcher::{anonymous}::parseExpression(const std::string&)’:
test/libsolidity/SemVerMatcher.cpp:78:1: error: control reaches end of non-void function [-Werror=return-type]
