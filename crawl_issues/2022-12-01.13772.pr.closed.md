Unfortunately now this old version of code is not enough, because need to adjust jump offsets. They need to be within the code section, i.e. in this simplified PR we could just start all jumps with a `+10` offset (due to the fixed header size).

Need to expose `eofVersion` in `AbstractAssembly` and passed down to `assemble()`.

@axic @r0qs @ekpyron is this supposed to end up being merge-able, or is it just a PoC before the spec is finalized?

In general, the sooner we get this stuff actually merge-able the better - but first of all it serves as PoC (and as basis for the other EOF-PoCs). But this PR here doesn't even have the most recent version of this - that'd be here:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/compare/eof1-container...eof1-container-test

Which also adds a CI run that actually tests this stuff. But those tests still fail, since the evmone branch implementing EOF still doesn't implement the most recent spec of things :-).

So yeah, in practice, I don't see an imminent merge happening here :-).

@ekpyron I'd vote getting all those commits into this PR and preparing this for merge. If there's any header change it can be applied. It will be worse maintaining all these separate branches/PRs imho.

@axic do you have a branch of evmone without the to-be-dropped requirement for terminating instructions at the end? Without that we can't merge this anyways.

@ekpyron I think that can be sorted out, but yeah you're right this depends on testing suite, which is the achilles heel.

If we get such an evmone branch, though, we can indeed set somebody on making this mergable.
