### What

Switch the default code generation backend.

### Why

Switching to this will help alleviate stack-too-deep errors, it will allow better optimizations thanks to the YUL optimizer.
The compiler output code will be more human-readable.
The codegen is more uniform and, therefore, less error-prone, reducing the risk of compiler bugs.

### How

Informing Tooling teams to prepare to make this switch.
We won't remove the old code generation pipeline immediately.
If we don't have any significant negative feedback, we'll remove it 2 quarters later.

#### Tasks
