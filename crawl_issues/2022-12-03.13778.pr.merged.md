@ekpyron should this be mentioned in the changelog? I only see one entry related to `solidity-upgrade` and it's a bug fix.

Technically, it probably should, but since I don't think anyone uses it, and we haven't tracked it there, I'm fine with just merging.

On a second thought: since solidity-upgrade is actually packaged downstream (e.g. in https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/solidity/), maybe it's better to have a short note about it in the Changelog after all.
