## Description

- The `typeString` field of a function type, e.g., `function (string memory) external` is `function (string) external`. 
- It should be `function (string memory) external`

## Environment

- Compiler version: Solidity 0.8.17
- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04

## Steps to Reproduce
- Input file: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/abiEncoder/abi_encode_conversions.sol
- Running: `solc --ast-compact-json --pretty-json abi_encode_conversions.sol -o . --overwrite`

@aarlt can you take a look and triage this, since you're the JSON AST expert? :)

The reference type arguments for external function types don't *really* involve a data location - you can also assign a function taking a calldata argument to a function pointer taking a memory argument. There's a related issue to actually make data locations on external function pointers optional to clarify this - it's a bit unfortunate that this way it's not precisely possible to construct sources from the AST (until we make the data locations actually optional in function types) - but you can always default to ``memory`` for them and all code should work...

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
