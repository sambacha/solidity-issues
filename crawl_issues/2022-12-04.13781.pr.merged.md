Compat version 13 is currently the recommended one.

An important change introduced in 10 was change of default to target parallel builds

In another package I've updated, I was able to confirm my changes with `debuild -b -uc -us` executed in `debian/`-enabled repository

Usually on any changes to this script we run it to create a prerelease on launchpad (we can do that at any time). A CI run for this seems a bit of an overkill, this script hardly ever changes :-).

https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man7/debhelper.7.html#compatibility%20levels
would suggest that we may also need to bump the ``debhelper`` version in `debian/control` as a dependency, though?
``g++ (>= 5.0)`` could also have used a bump ages ago I guess :-).

I'll update those as well

I've updated the mentioned files. I've only updated gcc for solidity itself, I think z3 might support older versions, even though I wasn't able to verify that in their CI/docs immediately.

I've updated GCC to 9+, this is currently used in your CI setup.

Btw the copyright section in the package is really outdated, the complete license is [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/templates/license.h.in)

The license changes would fall outside of scope I intended for this PR. Can it be merged now?

Also, review fixes need to be squashed into the original commit before we merge.

I just tried to create a prerelease from this PR and unfortunately it fails for some reason:

```
dpkg-source: info: using source format '3.0 (quilt)'
dpkg-source: info: building solc using existing ./solc_0.8.18~develop-2022-12-06-51b4861e.orig.tar.gz
dpkg-source: error: cannot represent change to deps/downloads/fmt-8.0.1.tar.gz: binary file contents changed

dpkg-buildpackage: error: dpkg-source -b . subprocess returned exit status 1
debuild: fatal error at line 1182:
dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -ui -S -d -sa failed
```

I tried running on `develop` and there it works. On top of this PR it failed twice. We'll need to figure out what's happening. I'm leaving it for now because we have a release coming and need to focus on getting PRs ready for that. This one unfortunately won't make it.

### Repro
Here's how I was running it:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --volume /tmp/gnupg:/root/.gnupg debian
```

```bash
branch=debian-compat-13-ppa

cd
apt update
apt install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends git wget devscripts debhelper dput

# My key has Unicode characters and makes gpg fail with the default POSIX locale
apt install --assume-yes --no-install-recommends locales
sed -i 's/^# *\(en_US\.UTF-8\)/\1/' /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

git clone https://github.com/ethereum/solidity --depth 1 --branch "$branch"
cd solidity/
git branch --show-current

cat << EOF > /etc/dput.cf 
[ethereum-dev]
fqdn            = ppa.launchpad.net
method          = ftp
incoming        = ~ethereum/ethereum-dev
login           = anonymous

[ethereum]
fqdn            = ppa.launchpad.net
method          = ftp
incoming        = ~ethereum/ethereum
login           = anonymous

[ethereum-static]
fqdn            = ppa.launchpad.net
method          = ftp
incoming        = ~ethereum/ethereum-static
login           = anonymous
EOF

cat << EOF > .release_ppa_auth
export LAUNCHPAD_EMAIL=<my mail>
export LAUNCHPAD_KEYID=<my key id>
EOF

scripts/release_ppa.sh "$branch"
```

BTW, I had to create a branch called `debian-compat-13-ppa` pointing at this PR because `release_ppa.sh` expects a branch from our repo (not a fork). We can delete it when the PR is merged.

The error message suggests it's this issue: https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/dpkg-dev/dpkg-source.1.en.html#cannot_represent_change_to_file but do you modify the file in question? Is it referenced anywhere in the debian package specs? I can't find such references anywhere.

Fun fact: we just figured out that apparently multiple fetches of https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/archive/8.0.1.tar.gz yield archives with different hashes, albeit with identical contents, that seems to be causing the issue - probably unrelated to the change in this PR.

Looks like it's not related to the PR after all.

The file is indeed different but this seems to be a weird issue on Github. The source link suddenly started non-deterministically returning different files. If you run this multiple times:
```bash
curl https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/archive/8.0.1.tar.gz --remote-name --location --silent && sha256sum 8.0.1.tar.gz
```
you'll eventually get different hashes. Either `b06ca3130158c625848f3fb7418f235155a4d389b2abc3a6245fb01cb0eb1e01` or `a811a7d8b49694514b49059ae390f2417d6c53b6ec3f1e83a3a65619ed37375f`. Both are valid archives with the same exact content (diffs binary equal) but the archives themselves are different (one is ~2 kB bigger).

It appears that the source archive for version 9.1.0 has the same problem. Might be a more widespread github issue. Our CI builds are now regularly failing due to this.

This is breaking our release scripts and we have a release planned for tomorrow so it's a big issue we're trying to work around now.

I think you may already be involved, but just in case: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-30-git-archive-checksums-may-change/

Now that we're done with releasing solc, I tried doing a pre-release PPA build again and it succeeded as expected. The Z3 build seems to work as well locally, though I could not really test it fully because we already have the latest version built and Launchpad rejects it for that reason. At least does not seem like it fails due to any other problem.

I think we can merge it once CI finishes.

From the looks of it, the prerelease was created from the old script without this PR, though - and apparently ubuntu focal actually is incompatible with the change (see https://launchpadlibrarian.net/652849231/buildlog_ubuntu-focal-amd64.solc_1%3A0.8.19-0ubuntu1~focal_BUILDING.txt.gz) - so we'll need to revert this PR, unfortunately.
