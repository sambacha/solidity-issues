Update the editor extensions section of the resources page:

1. Remove the Atom section - as Atom is being deprecated on 2022-12-15. See https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/
2. Update the vim syntax plugins - add the thesis fork of the tomlion vim syntax highlighter. The thesis fork is maintained.
3. add/rename vscode extensions - add truffle and remix extensions and rename the two Solidity extensions to include the authors.

Oh, this also needs commits to be squashed (does not have to be just one but at least review fixes should not be separate commits - they should be fixed up into the original commits they modify).

@cameel I have squashed them down to one commit and updated the text on that commit to reflect the further actions/updates we took.
