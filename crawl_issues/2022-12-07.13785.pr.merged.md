# [\#13785 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13785) `merged`: Strict assembly fuzzer: Change optimization setting from full to minimal
**Labels**: `fuzz blocker`

I'm not sure what the `full` optimization setting does when YulStack is not used for optimization (only parsing).

> You're not using it only for parsing though (unless the assumption is that all examples will fail at the parsing step?). You still have a call to `assemble()` there and this runs the optimizer. It also does stack optimizations.

The main issue with the `full` optimization setting is that, it reports ICEs that I am not able to reproduce via the command line i.e., 

```
$ solc --strict-assembly --asm test.yul
```

uses `minimal` optimization setting and only parses and assembles using this setting.

```
$ solc --strict-assembly --optimize --asm test.yul
```

uses `full` optimization setting and parses, optimizes, and assembles using this setting.

How could I reproduce (via CLI) ICEs that happen when `full` optimization setting is used only for assembly but not optimization?

So you're saying that `solc --strict-assembly --optimize` does not really apply full optimization at all stages? Sounds like something we should fix instead.

@cameel did this go into the release? If not, please move it to the next milestone.

We should discuss this on the channel.

I approved this and I don't think merging it would break anything but from what I understand so far, it looks like this might not be a proper fix but rather just a workaround for how `--optimize` works and maybe we should take a closer look at that instead.

@bshastry Do you happen to have an example case of such an ICE that's not reproducible via CLI? It'd probably easy to see what happens :-). Maybe ``--yul-optimizations ":"`` will allow triggering it these days, but yeah, I'm not sure whether it's too many or too few optimizations or what exactly is the issue here - with an example case it might be easier to tell :-).

Fine with merging this in any case.

So basically in this configuration of YulStack

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7cd589eee46bf83635bd279d0957c199ec16c8ca/test/tools/ossfuzz/strictasm_assembly_ossfuzz.cpp#L40-L46

issuing an assemble as in here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7cd589eee46bf83635bd279d0957c199ec16c8ca/test/tools/ossfuzz/strictasm_assembly_ossfuzz.cpp#L53

throws

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7cd589eee46bf83635bd279d0957c199ec16c8ca/libyul/backends/evm/StackLayoutGenerator.cpp#L759

for the following input

```
{
  function g(b,s) -> y {
    y := g(b, g(y, s))
  }
}
```

However, if the change in this PR is applied, it no longer throws.

As I tried to reproduce the throw on CLI, I found that the CLI command `solc --strict-assembly --asm test.yul` uses the minimal optimizer setting and does not throw.

ok, I think I finally understand what is happening here and what you meant by "when YulStack is not used for optimization (only parsing)". So it's only specifically optimization you're skipping, not code generation, which is what I thought you meant by "only parsing". And I was wrong about the optimizer - you *are* skipping the Yul optimizer (i.e. `YulStack::optimize()`) and the `assembly.optimise()` I pointed out is only the libevmasm optimizer.

So the problem probably is that you're running with the libevmasm optimizer enabled but Yul optimizer disabled, which you can't really do on the CLI. It is only possible via Standard JSON. But, as @ekpyron pointed you, you can get something close enough with `--yul-optimizations ":"`. For me this reproduces your ICE:
```bash
solc test.yul --strict-assembly --optimize --asm --yul-optimizations ":"
```
```
======= test.sol (EVM) =======
Uncaught exception:
/solidity/libyul/backends/evm/StackLayoutGenerator.cpp(759): Throw in function solidity::yul::StackLayoutGenerator::fillInJunk(const solidity::yul::CFG::BasicBlock&, const solidity::yul::CFG::FunctionInfo*)::<lambda(solidity::yul::Stack, const Stack&)>::<lambda(const StackSlot&)>
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Yul assertion failed
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Yul assertion failed
```

In any case, please report this as a bug. The fact that it fails on `yulAssert(depth)` suggests that it might be a variant of "stack too deep" but even if that's the case, it should be raising `StackTooDeepError` instead. Failing on an assertion is a bug and skips any handlers we or tools might have specifically for "stack too deep" (you actually have exactly such a handler in your code, which would catch it).

In that case I'm merging the PR. It does seem to be the correct solution to your problem after all. But now the question is if we should be fuzzing the config with only libevmasm optimizer enabled as well? It is something you can reproduce on the CLI after all, and actually, `--yul-optimizations ":"` is exactly what we've been suggesting to tools lately.
