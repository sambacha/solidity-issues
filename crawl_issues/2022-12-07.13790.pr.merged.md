**Labels**: `roadmap`

Fixes #11969. Part of #13718.
~Depends on #13741.~ Merged.

**Here is a high-level description of the changes introduced by the PR: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13718#issuecomment-1341058649. I recommend reading that before reviewing.**

This PR replaces #12362, which has accumulated too many comments and will be hard to get through to anyone wanting to do a fresh review. With the simplifications, fixes and extra tests, I think the code has diverged enough from the original that it will be easier to look at on its own. The code has also been trimmed down quite a bit, with a series of refactor PRs merged separately and support for structs moved to a separate branch ([`user-defined-operators-for-structs`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/user-defined-operators-for-structs)).

I'm going to close the original PR by @wechman but before that I'll restore it to the state it was in before I took it over.

Added a change that disallows non-pure suffixes. Originally I wanted it to be a separate PR but this turned out to be simple enough that I think it's fine to add it here. It being a separate commit should be enough.

PR ready for review again:
- Disallowed using library functions for operators.
- Disallowed non-global operators.
- Operator bindings are type-checked in `using for` rather than at the point of use.
- More tests for various corner cases.
- Consistently using `TokenTraits::friendlyName()` in error messages.

Also:
- I did not yet implement storing information about operators in a source unit annotation. I'll do that in a follow-up PR not to stall this one.
    - My initial approach didn't work out because I did it in `TypeChecker` and there there's no guarantee that `using for` will be processed before the operator is used. I have another idea but not yet done with it.
- I did not forbid binding the same operator to the same function multiple times. Actually, without having the operators stored in the annotation, it's easier not to forbid it. I might still do it in the PR that adds the annotation.

Commits are a mess right now so I'll be squashing them and pushing here but there should be no more actual change unless requested in the review.

Sounds like a job for the ``DeclarationTypeChecker``- the purpose of that existing is exactly to precollect and precheck stuff before type checking to avoid problems like that... but yeah, really no need to do it in this PR, especially if the behaviour is already there.

And we'll need to redesign all of this for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13365 eventually anyways - might be wise to start thinking about that more concretely in the foreseeable future actually...

> Maybe we should have one or two tests about the evaluation order, so sth like

Added a test that checks evaluation order on some simple cases with binary/unary, multiple operators and operators nested in calls.

I wasn't sure if it would work because I could run into the same problem I have in `TypeChecker`. I.e. it's the `DeclarationTypeChecker` that processes `type T is X` declarations so at the point where I find `using for` the type used in it might not yet have all annotations needed to handle it.

My initial idea was actually to do it in `NameAndTypeResolver`, because it seems like it would be the right place for resolving what the operator name refers to. But I dropped that idea because it runs even earlier than `NameAndTypeResolver` so I have no type info yet.

The approach I wanted to try instead was to scan all `using for` directives in `TypeChecker`, but only once, when I'm visiting `SourceUnit` node.

> The using-for type checking issue could probably be rather easily solved by filling in annotation in the DeclarationTypeChecker, but we can postpone it.

Well, it's not complicated to implement but some approaches do not work so needs some experimentation. I was aiming to still get it into this release, just as a separate PR so that it does not  stop the main PR in case it's not ready.

The point is not to handle everything elsewhere, but to have one pass collect the statements in appropriate annotations and the next check it. But yeah, anyways - there's really no need to delay any of this for any of that :-).

I just pushed 4 more commits. Changes only in docs and tests:
- Correction for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13790#discussion_r1111967019.
- Syntax test for making a pure external call was actually broken and failing for an unrelated reason. Replaced it with a set of correct syntax tests for external calls and also added one semantic test since that case should actually work. I ran into #13989 while fixing them.
- Removed fixme about #13900 from smt tests.

I think I fixed all there was to fix. The commits are squashed. Here's a rough list of changes:
- Extra semantic tests for cleanup.
- Extra semantic test for an operator calling a `view` function via a mismatched interface.
- An error about the type not being an UDVT does not hide an error about the function not being free or pure (+test case).
- Extra assert about function not being bound when type-checking `using for`.
- Changed naming convention for semantic tests. The `calling_operator_` prefix was not helpful as it is in syntax tests, because all semantic tests necessarily invoke the operator.
