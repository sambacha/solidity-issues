Not meant as proper fix, but just to demonstrate the issue.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13825/files#r1098546344 already has a version that uses hashes to recognize duplicates instead - but we need to carefully check that it behaves properly wrt link references in all cases (especially if the duplicates are only due to subassemblies having the same code, but potentially coming from different source yul objects/contracts).

Do you see in the linked test files how to reproduce cases for which any of this happens or do you need some examples :-)?
