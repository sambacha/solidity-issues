The [`pool-together` external test](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/externalTests/pool-together.sh)
[1236822](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/27861/workflows/6ebcc686-9fc9-4574-8a32-f35177103202/jobs/1236822) started failing today, in PRs and on develop with errors like this:

```
  7) PrizeDistributor
       "before each" hook for "should succeed to read an empty Draw ID => DrawCalculator mapping":
     Error: cannot find artifact "ERC20Mintable"
      at Object.getArtifact (node_modules/hardhat-deploy/src/DeploymentsManager.ts:180:17)
      at getContractFactoryByName (node_modules/hardhat-deploy-ethers/src/internal/helpers.ts:228:20)
```

This is likely due to the fact that we're deleting any artifacts shipped with the project on purpose because we want them rebuilt by Hardhat: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/37e935f02546c83384ca6db9dd4d864bf533d004/test/externalTests/pool-together.sh#L72-L75

This used to work fine. Need to check why it broke all of a sudden.
