When there's more than one matching overload for an unqualified function call, compiler lists all matching candidates. This is not the case when the function is called on an object.

### Example - error for member access
```solidity
contract C {
    function f(uint16) public {}
    function f(uint32) public {}

    function test() public {
        this.f(uint16(1));
    }
}
```

```
Error: Member "f" not unique after argument-dependent lookup in contract C.
 --> test.sol:6:9:
  |
6 |         this.f(uint16(1));
  |         ^^^^^^
```

### Example - error for unqualified access
```solidity
contract C {
    function f(uint16) public {}
    function f(uint32) public {}

    function test() public {
        f(uint16(1));
    }
}
```
```
Error: No unique declaration found after argument-dependent lookup.
 --> test.sol:6:9:
  |
6 |         f(uint16(1));
  |         ^
Note: Candidate:
 --> test.sol:2:5:
  |
2 |     function f(uint16) public {}
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Candidate:
 --> test.sol:3:5:
  |
3 |     function f(uint32) public {}
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Is something like this supposed to be allowed?
```solidity
contract C {
    function f(uint16) public {}
    function f(uint32) public {}

    function test() public {
        f(uint16(1));
    }
}
```

I'm trying to use a pattern like this but can't get past the compiler error. Is the overload selection ambiguous because a `uint16` can be cast to a `uint32`?

No, this overload is currently ambiguous. See #1256.
