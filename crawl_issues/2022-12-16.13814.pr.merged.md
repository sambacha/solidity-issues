**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `external contribution :star:`

Note sure if `"type[]"` and `"type[20]"` were given as examples or not in the blocks below:

```c++
/// Constructor for a dynamically sized array type ("type[]")
...
/// Constructor for a fixed-size array type ("type[20]")
```

This PR replaces them with their generic form that was also used in a few lines above as a comment for `class ArrayType`:

```c++
/**
 * The type of an array. The flavours are byte array (bytes), statically- (<type>[<length>])
 * and dynamically-sized array (<type>[]).
```
