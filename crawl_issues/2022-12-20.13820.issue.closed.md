@franzihei noticed that the docs build started to fail and reported it in the matrix chat. After some investigation, it seems that since `sphinx-a4doc` version `1.4.0` the latex build crashes with the following error:

The full traceback has been saved in /tmp/sphinx-err-5t7rypkb.log, if you want to report the issue to the developers.
Please also report this if it was a user error, so that a better error message can be provided next time.

```

The problem seems to be related to this change https://github.com/taminomara/sphinx-a4doc/commit/169ca4384e095e752b34bdf95b9f7c151e9e5abb.

Fixing the version to `sphinx-a4doc==1.3.0` in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/requirements.txt#L7) fix the problem temporarily (tested with python3.7 and python3.9). But we need to investigate it further ~and report the issue upstream.~
