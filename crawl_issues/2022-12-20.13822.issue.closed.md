On some examples (notably chains.sol), the DataFlowAnalyzer still takes a gigantic part of the optimizer time.
Profiling shows that 63% of the whole computation time is spent inside `DataFlowAnalyzer::clearValues` while most of this time is spent inside `std::_Rb_tree<>::find(YulString const&)`.

An "easy" solution to this is to use better performing data structures to store the relation between how variables reference each other.

Another aspect that wastes time is that variables that are assigned inside e.g. an if body are determined multiple times when the if bodies are nested. It might be better to collect assigned variables (or reset them) at the point we visit the assignment.

A backwards map-to-string already improved performance tremendously. What would probably best is to use a data structure that contains two instances of the form `set<pair<YulString, YulString>>`, for forward and backward references. loer_bound / upper_bound operations allow iterating over keys and efficient deleting without the additional overhead of a set inside a map.

Ah, I did this with another `unordered_map<YulString, set<YulString>`. Will see if I can get additional gains with your approach.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
