Initial draft implementation of the complete unified EOF spec.
Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13717
To be used as:
```
solc --evm-version shanghai --experimental-eof-version 1 --via-ir --optimize --bin --runtime-bin <contract.sol>
```
or for compiling yul-to-eof:
```
solc --evm-version shanghai --experimental-eof-version 1 --optimize --strict-assembly --bin <code.yul>
```
(optimizer is required for now, but its effects can be minimized by ``--yul-optimizations ":"``)

We briefly discussed with @ekpyron trying to merge this at some point, so that recent EOF changes can be prototyped by external people.
