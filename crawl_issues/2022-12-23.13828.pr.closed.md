Added functionality for assembly to support underscore's and scientific notation in numeric short form. Fixes #13407

This will now work:
```
contract A {
    function b() public pure {
    uint c;
        assembly {
            c := 3200000000
            c := 3_200_000_000
            c := 1e3
        }
    }
}
```

Thank you for working on this, but we won't be pursuing this change in assembly/yul for the time being, so I'm closing the PR.
