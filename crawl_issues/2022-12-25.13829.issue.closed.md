## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/abi-spec.html#use-of-dynamic-types

## Abstract

In the following sentence : **We take the first four bytes of sha3("f(uint256,uint32[],bytes10,bytes)"), i.e. 0x8be65246.** maybe you should replace **sha3** by **keccak**, it could mislead some people.
