sphinx 6.0.0 was released several hours ago (https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/releases/tag/v6.0.0) and it is not supported by current code: example of filed docs build https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/27991/workflows/8f12532e-1234-4041-80c3-e6d395958a30/jobs/1242177

I propose to fix version to 5.* as temporary fast solution

Hi @quantum13, thanks for your contribution.

Indeed, as we don't fix the versions of the dependencies, the recent update of `sphinx` to `6.0.0` dropped support to [docutils 0.17](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/changes.html#release-6-0-0-released-dec-29-2022) and as `sphinx_rtd_theme` does not have an official release with support to `docutils 0.18` https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/1302#issuecomment-1355106377 the build of the documentation started to fail as you noted.

Maybe it is better to wait for the next `sphinx_rtd_theme` release?

@r0qs I do not insist. I just thought that better not to confuse contributors with broken docs build step (as I was confused in #13816).

Please close this PR if you think that better to wait.

No problem at all, I totally agree with you. It is just because we recently had a similar situation with `sphinx-a4doc` in which the issue was quickly fixed upstream, and now I need to redo the workaround. So, it may be the case here as well.

As the documentation build is not critical, we can probably spend some time rethinking the current setup.
For instance, I would like to hear from others if we should change to a fixed version in the `requeriments.txt` instead of relying on minimum versions as it is now. Or if we should update the current minimum versions since they are already pretty outdated.

Any suggestion here @ekpyron @cameel ?

@r0qs I would merge this and then either look for a more 'long term' solution later (e.g. pinning a specific version in `requirements.txt` as you suggested), or simply wait until it's fixed upstream (is there an issue in the sphinx repo for this?).
I'd like to just note, that `docs` is a required steps and is currently blocking merging anything.

Ok. It is an issue in `sphinx_rtd_theme` and it was already fixed there, but not released yet. They have a release candidate version though.

We can give the release candidate a try.
