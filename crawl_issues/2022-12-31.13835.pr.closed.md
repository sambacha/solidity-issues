This PR changes the print statements to `f-strings`, which makes the code faster.

Hi, thanks for your contribution. What is the real benefit of the change in our case? Can you provide data on how fast it is compared with the current version?

Hi @SmashedFrenzy16, thanks for bringing this up, but it turned out that this script is not being used anymore, and we should remove it (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13852). So I'm closing this PR for now.
