Thanks for your contribution, but the license is not a markdown file.

It is commonplace to name it `LICENSE.md` for rendering purposes (also every text file is markdown implicitly, just without rendering). It is also more common to just name it `LICENSE`. The least common option is what we have with the `.txt` extension.

I honestly never saw it with the `.md` extension, but indeed have seen it as just `LICENSE` or with the `.txt` extension. Maybe because the use of license files is prior to the existence of markdown.

Should we rename it to `LICENSE`, then? Because in the way it currently is, it does not follow the markdown syntax.
