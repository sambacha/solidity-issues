I tried to enhance the cheat sheet as per issue #12934, and I converted the [Modifiers](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html#modifiers) section of cheatsheet into a clean formatted table.

I will appreciate the review on this PR.

Heya @bakhtiarcr7, I'm gonna generate the docs and take a look. In the meantime, can you please pull and rebase vs the latest develop, as this should fix the failing steps (of which `docs` is required for merging).

I've rebased the PR again the latest upstream develop to get the build green. Overall, the direction of the PR is good, as we would prefer to have tables over lists - however, you'll have to address the requested changes before we can proceed.
