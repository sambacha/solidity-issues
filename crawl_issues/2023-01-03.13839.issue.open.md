```
==== Source: s1.sol ====
import {f as g, g as h} from "s1.sol";
function f() pure returns (uint) { return 100 + h() - g(); }
==== Source: s2.sol ====
import {f as h} from "s1.sol";
function f() pure returns (uint) { return 2; }
function g() pure returns (uint) { return 4; }
==== Source: s3.sol ====
import "s2.sol";
contract C {
  function foo() public pure returns (uint) {
return f() - g() - h();
  }
}
// ----
// foo() -> FAILURE
```

To reproduce, copy the test file in `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/test.sol` and run 

```
$ isoltest --show-messages semanticTests/test
```

Since both being error cases, the main question here is how annoying this is for fuzzing - apart from that, we could even accept the difference and close this.

This is not annoying for fuzzing, it is just one of the few corner cases reported. I opened an issue in case there is something important that we should consider.
