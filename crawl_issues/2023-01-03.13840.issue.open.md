pragma solidity 0.8.17;

contract Lottery{
    address public owner;
    constructor(){
        owner == msg.sender;
    }
} 
```

**Issue:** In the given code, there is a mistake in the assignment of the `owner` variable in the `constructor` function. Instead of using the assignment operator `=`, the double equal `==` operator is used, which is a comparison operator and does not assign a value to the variable. This mistake can be hard to identify, as the Solidity compiler does not raise any `warnings` or `errors` for this issue.

**Feature Expected:** As a result, it is essential for the compiler should carefully check the code and make sure that the correct operators are used at the time of initialization of a variable at the function level.

We in fact do have a warning for cases like this: ``Statement has no effect``. However, we reserved it to only pure statement for a somewhat odd reason: a view statement without effect can be used to silence the ``mutability can be restricted to pure`` warning and we don't have a better workaround.

The middle ground here would probably be to only allow very specific view statements without effect (like e.g. ``this``), while extending the "has no effect" warning to all other more complex cases. An even better solution may be to extend the warning to *all* statements without effect and to come up with a new way to silence mutability warnings explicitly.
