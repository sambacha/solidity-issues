**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

As we've previously [pinned the v4-core version](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13806) in pooltogether external tests, and reported an [issue](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-core/issues/287), which has been resolved - I am removing the version pin. However, when doing so, we get the following error:
```
Wrong compiler version detected
```
This is a know issue, and we have `neutralize_packaged_contracts` for that precise reason.
