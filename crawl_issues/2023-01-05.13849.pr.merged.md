We've had this job fail every day for years now, posting messages to the channel, without that making us fix it, so the notifications have clearly failed its purpose :-).

We can add them back, when the job is succeeding again, but for now the notifications serve little purpose other than spamming the channel :-).

Pinging @bshastry to be aware of this, in case we merge it.

I'd guess that @bshastry will keep having an eye for the CI run when we merge the PRs fixing the issues - and once we fixed everything, we can just revert this change, so I don't think we'll need an issue for tracking it.
