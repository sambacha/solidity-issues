# [\#13851 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13851) `closed`: Allow try/catch without the catch

## Abstract

Solidity always requires `try { â€¦ }` to be followed by `catch { â€¦ }`. Make `catch { â€¦ }` optional.

## Motivation

Most of the time I do `try { â€¦ } catch {}` to make a non-reverting call, and do something if only there is no failure. In those cases, I have no use for `catch`, so I leave it empty within `{}`. But it just looks ugly. I want to be able to write `try { â€¦ }` without any trailing `catch {}`.

## Specification

Make `try { â€¦ }` equivalent to `try { â€¦ } catch {}`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change seems to be entirely backwards compatible.
