Maybe we could just remove the whole `scripts/endToEndExtraction` directory. I guess the probability is quite low that we will need that again. However, why should we only remove that `verify-testcases.py` script?

Indeed. We should remove all `endToEndExtraction` if they are no longer used. I updated the title and issue description.

I see that we did test extraction in #8464 and #8518. In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8197#issuecomment-609825831 @chriseth said that most of the remaining tests check for events. We also still have #12253 open ([`SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SolidityEndToEndTest.cpp) still has ~4k lines) and isoltest now supports events (#11050). So are we sure we won't be doing any more extraction?

Right. We could quickly discuss that in the meeting this week then.

Nobody said we wouldn't extract anything else, but I don't see us using the scripts for whatever remains.
