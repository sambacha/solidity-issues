Looks like `verbatim` is considered to have defaulted control flow side effects, so it's e.g. assumed not to successfully terminate a transaction.

This should either be changed or at least be clearly documented, since it is well possible to construct `verbatim` that very much does affect control flow behaviour, which would be ill-behaved for example wrt the unused store eliminator.

We should probably do the following:
- change the control flow side effects of `verbatim` to ``canContinue && canRevert && canTerminate``
- double-check that this makes it well-behaved everywhere when constructing `verbatim` from existing opcodes
- consider strengthening the warning in the docs towards potentially not all side-effects being known, resp. it being user-responsibility to make sure that "worst side effects of existing opcodes" are "bad enough".
- document that ``msize`` in verbatim will be ignored (while ``msize`` otherwise is disallowed with the optimizer)
