Due to the recent upgrade of our docker images from 20.04 to 22.04, and thus the related gcc upgrade, the `b_ubu_cxx20` job started failing due to usage of deprecated functions, structs, stdlib features, etc.

These will need to be addressed, and the `b_ubu_cxx20` job re-enabled in `.circleci/config.yml`.
