## Abstract

According to the above page, for C++ we have as dependencies: 
       Boost (version 1.77+ on Windows, 1.65+ otherwise) | C++ libraries.

with a note below: "Starting from 0.5.10 linking against Boost 1.70+ should work without manual intervention."

But in this change: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/1da82045c4881e5ccd6f15f7abf472272e1028cd "fs::directory_options" was used. a feature which was added in boost 1.72.

What's the minimum boost version you are targeting?

The Windows boost version is also technically wrong, as it needs to be 1.77 exactly. See:
