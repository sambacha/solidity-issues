Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13767. 

This PR migrates the `prb-math` external tests script to python and add support to foundry.

The PR also adds an initial architecture to the python-based external tests. The idea was to allow us to easily migrate from different test frameworks as external projects change their dependencies.

I didn't migrate all the shellscripts yet, for instance, the `store_benchmark_report` still missing for the `prb-math`. But it would be nice to discuss some ideas around the current architecture.

Depends on: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13982, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14064 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14140.

- The dependence on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13982 is due to the change of the [t_ems_ext](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13982/files#diff-78a8a19706dbd2a4425dd72bdab0502ed7a2cef16365ab7030a5a0588927bf47L1221), which was renamed to `t_ext` and now receives the `image` as parameter instead of only the nodejs version. This allows running some external tests on different base images, e.g. `cimg/rust:1.66.1`. ~The change was required since Foundry depends on rust and not nodejs~. Actually, as we are now downloading the `forge` binary, rust is not needed.

- The dependence on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14064 is based on the replacement of the old `test/externalTests.sh` by a python script that allows run one, multiple or all external tests.

- The dependence on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14140 is due to the new `install_python3` and `install_foundry` CI commands.

TODO:
- [ ] Update external tests README (I think we can update the docs once we migrate the other tests to python as well. So we can have a PR that introduces the new way of setup a external test using the python-based suite)
- [ ] Add support to Foundry in `parse_eth_gas_report.py` (will be done in a future PR)
- [ ] Store Foundry benchmarks report (will be done in a future PR)

I believe most of the comments were addressed and this is now ready for review again. Let me know if I forgot something.

> To make the review smoother I tried to avoid commenting on trivial stuff that's easy to fix. Instead I just checked out the branch and corrected it myself as I went through the PR. I committed it all as fixups and pushed to your branch. Feel free to just squash it but let me know if you disagree with any of the changes.

Nice thanks, I agree with all the changes. I just used the default [black](https://github.com/psf/black) config to formatting the code in the PR, could you share your config so I can update my editor to not mess up with the current one?

Oh, so that's the formatting from black. I didn't realize you were already using it. If that's automatic formatting then that's good enough I guess. I thought you were doing it by hand.

I think you just have it configured for wrong line length and its wrapping a lot of things that do not need to be wrappsed ([we have line length set to 130 characters in `pylintrc`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/pylintrc#L65)).

BTW, feel free to add your black config to the repo (in a separate PR), next to `pylintrc`. Even if it's not hooked into CI, it would not hurt if we all used the same config locally. I don't have my own config, since I prefer formatting by hand so we can take yours as a starting point.

Yes. I will adjust the line length on my config then and create a PR for it. Maybe even hook it and mypy in the CI, so we can already get all these style checks ;)

Just FYI, what I just pushed is only a small fixup commit + rebase + conflict resolutions (the presets that were disabled when you started it now work on `develop` and can be enabled).
