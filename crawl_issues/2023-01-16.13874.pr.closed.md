The check in `CMakeLists.txt` needs to be updated to match: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/609f15229bd72310925b038ee83328cab13c3043/cmake/EthDependencies.cmake#L34-L41

Please also remember to include a short comment pointing out why earlier versions won't work.

There are also two more places that check version, but we probably can leave them at 1.65:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/609f15229bd72310925b038ee83328cab13c3043/libsolutil/Numeric.h#L28-L30
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/609f15229bd72310925b038ee83328cab13c3043/libsolutil/Common.h#L44-L46

They were added in #5824, apparently because earlier versions required some workarounds for multiprecision. So this particular code should still work on 1.65.

If the current build passes, I'll make the changes here as well.

I would not really bump that version. I'd consider just removing it because the one in CMakeFiles.txt covers this anyway. But I'm also fine with leaving it as is. It does seem accurate for these particular files.

I'll remove it.
