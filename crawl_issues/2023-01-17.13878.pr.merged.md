# [\#13878 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13878) `merged`: Remove workarounds for latest dependencies from gnosis ext test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-01-17 15:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13878):

Just a quick workaround cleanup in the Gnosis Safe test.

I rechecked https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/2051, because it was recently closed despite the fact that I don't think it was actually fixed and it confirmed that. While doing it I noticed that a bunch of the other workarounds are no longer needed though.
