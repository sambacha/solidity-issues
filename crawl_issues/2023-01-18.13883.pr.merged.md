> Just to confirm, once #13759 is merged, this PR should be rebased, and should then in theory be green (unless we've mixed fixing up some tests), right?

Yes, I think so.

Since it's already based on the ``prevrandao`` branch, it shouldn't even need a rebase.

SMTChecker tests that are flaky on os x are @leonardoalt's specialty... rule of thumb in such cases: just disable the test and hope for better times.

> Looks good but the PR does more than just changing the default version. There's some stuff related to `difficulty` and `prevrandao` that looks like it should have been done in #13759.

It mostly does the smt checker changes, which couldn't have properly been done before since the smtchecker is only tested against the most recent evm version.

Oh, needs some commit squashing. All the SMT stuff should probably be in one commit.

@ekpyron @r0qs @cameel I updated the SMT code and tests and committed directly here. Feel free to squash the last 2 commits (SMT related) or move it around.

The rest of the SMT stuff LGTM.

Approved - disabled automerge again, in case we still want to squash, otherwise it can just be merged.
