# [\#13885 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13885) `closed`: Memory allocation in for-loops are never treated as temporary

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31553173?u=fbe6c6b8d63f693b8367103acdd1299b31961d12&v=4" width="50">[brockelmore](https://github.com/brockelmore) opened issue at [2023-01-20 18:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13885):

## Description
An effective memory leak in for-loops or while loops leads to blowup in evm memory usage. The compiler does not recognize basically any memory storage as temporary inside a for-loop so there is a boatload of unnecessary memory expansions.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.17, via-ir true or false, 10m optimizer runs
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): latest
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: REVM
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.6.2 <0.9.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract OutOfGas is Test {

    function testOutOfGas() public {
        vm.pauseGasMetering();

        for(uint256 i = 0; i <= 129100; i++){
            console2.log("Run #", i, gasleft());
        }
    }
}
```

alternative, abi.encode version:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity >=0.6.2 <0.9.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract OutOfGas is Test {

    function testOutOfGas() public {
        vm.pauseGasMetering();

        mineSalt(bytes32(uint256(1)));
    }

    function mineSalt(bytes32 bytecodeHash) internal pure returns (bytes32 salt) {
        uint256 targetStart = uint16(bytes2(hex"1234"));
        uint256 targetEnd = uint16(bytes2(hex"5678"));

        uint256 i;
        address addr;

        while (uint16(uint160(addr) >> 144) != targetStart || uint16(uint160(addr)) != targetEnd) {
            salt = bytes32(i);
            // computeCreate2Address uses keccak256 + abi.encodePacked
            addr = computeCreate2Address(salt, bytecodeHash, address(2000));
            i += 1;
        }
    }
}
```

here is a foundry.toml to use:
```toml
[profile.default]
auto_detect_solc = false
bytecode_hash = "none"
ffi = true
fuzz = { runs = 256 }
gas_reports = ["*"]
libs = ["lib"]
optimizer = true
optimizer_runs = 10_000_000
memory_limit = 33554432 # default limit
via-ir = true
out = "out"
solc = "0.8.17"
src = "src"
test = "test"
```

while the above wouldn't be possible in normal deployed applications, it highlights that there are unneeded free memory pointer updates and treating memory variables as permanent inside a for-loop when unnecessary. The above in latest foundry errors out with `OutOfGas` but only because of our imposed memory limit of 33.5mb per call frame. This means that for each iteration we are expanding memory. It affects non-function call loops (i.e. `abi.encode` and its variants) as well.

There are some issues related to this already: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12335, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5107

What's interesting about how this interacts with for loops or while loops is that a programmer might analyze a function and conclude it should run in linear or sublinear time/gas, but instead get quadratic gas due to memory expansion. This should be considered a serious issue.

Currently the plan is to tackle these issues in Q3: #13722.

Yeah, this is a known issue and we'll get to it this year - closing this as duplicate of the linked issues.
