Hi @Zachinquarantine, thanks for your contribution. Could you also remove the whole `endToEndExtraction` folder? It turns out that we don't need it anymore. See here for reference: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13852#issuecomment-1405214622

Took over and removed the folder. Also rebased on develop.
