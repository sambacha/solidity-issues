# [\#13891 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13891) `closed`: 26-byte memory leak in libcln makes the nightly `t_ubu_asan_soltest` and `t_ubu_asan_cli` jobs fail
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `low effort`, `medium impact`

Our address sanitizer jobs keep failing due to a small memory leak, apparently coming from libcln.

We should reproduce and report upstream if possible, but it does not seem to be coming from our own code so first we need to silence that in the nightly run. It's currently spamming the #solidity-dev channel with tons of messages every day.

@r0qs's analysis of the issue:

My guess is that this is some static global allocation in libcln, which is probably perfectly fine, so (of course after a proper investigation) we may just want to blacklist allocations from there being sanitized (there ought to be *some* way of doing that). Interestingly, due to similar issues with Z3 and CVC4 in general, we don't even run the SMT tests in those test runs, I think - so it may actually stem from some static library initialization merely due to linking to it itself, not from actually running anything through it. But yeah, worth a closer look eventually.

The easiest way to sched a bit more light on this without too much effort would probably be to work within the dockerimage environment of this test run, remove the ``libcln-dev`` package and replace it by a custom build with debug symbols, which should tell us what ``/usr/lib/libcln.so.6+0x56c2f`` really is (there may even be some way to plug in remote debugging symbols or such with even less effort).

```

However, running with `ASAN_OPTIONS=report_globals=0` (https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags#run-time-flags) and `-fsanitize=address` doesn't seem to work though. And the blocklist seems to be only supported by clang: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer#turning-off-instrumentation

For a bit more context of why this started to happen when we migrated to Ubuntu `22.04`. It seems to be because CVC4 actually has CLN as an [optional feature](https://github.com/CVC4/CVC4-archived/blob/master/INSTALL.md#cln--v13-class-library-for-numbers), but Jammy ships CVC4 with it enabled by default (see cvc4 build logs: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/500040171/buildlog_ubuntu-groovy-amd64.cvc4_1.8-2_BUILDING.txt.gz - search for `MP library`).
While Ubuntu `20.04` doesn't, it uses the default CVC4 multi-precision arithmetic package, which is GMP (see: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/463402585/buildlog_ubuntu-focal-amd64.cvc4_1.6-2build2_BUILDING.txt.gz).

Rebuilding CVC4 with GMP instead of CLN work around the problem.

A static global for a shared library in a header... what are they thinking there :-)...
And this is what it does: https://www.ginac.de/CLN/cln.git/?p=cln.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/base/output/cl_prin_globals.cc;hb=HEAD

Quite weird, if you ask me...

haha. Maybe setting `alloc_dealloc_mismatch` to false and/or `asan-globals` to 0 could also work. I also found this option: [malloc_context_size=0](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerCallStack) which may work. But it would disable it completely I guess.

I guess that's meant to be a workaround for undefined order of initialization of static globals...
Should probably rather use something like
```
cl_print_flags& default_print_flags();
```
with an implemenation of
```
cl_print_flags& default_print_flags()
{
    static cl_print_flags flags;
    return flags;
}
```

If we want to suggest that upstream... won't solve our problem short-term, though...

I guess the hardcore method for working around this on our end for now would be
```
sed -i -e 's/static cl_prin_globals_init_helper cl_prin_globals_init_helper_instance;//' /usr/include/cln/io.h
```
for that build run - that *may* solve this and I'd be surprised if it had any bad effects...

Yeah, and IMHO rebuilding CVC4 disabling CLN seems fine to me. I mean, we were already not using CLN with CVC4 and the Ubuntu Focal image, so even though the CVC4 docs claims that CLN has some performance gains against GMP, going back to GMP would only keep us in a similar configuration as we had before the migration to Ubuntu Jammy. And we don't need to mess with anything.

Rebuilding a custom cvc4 messes up all our testing. Building with or without GMP has caused various differences in Z3 in the past - same danger for CVC4 I guess...

As in: the SMT test suite won't pass against a stock ubuntu installation, if we test against custom builds of things.

But yeah, as for the root cause in libcln: it's actually not a false positive - cln is properly leaking memory there (even though not exactly a devestating amount) :-). Might be worth reporting.

Maybe we should just disable CVC4 for now, if that helps. Most SMTChecker tests rely on z3 because of CHC (CVC4 doesn't have a CHC solver), and we need to upgrade the interface to CVC5 anyway.

The following options works:
```
LSAN_OPTIONS="malloc_context_size=0" solc
```

or

```
cat <<- 'EOF' > cln.supp
leak:*__interceptor_malloc*
EOF
LSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=cln.supp" solc
```

I cannot suppress by `cl_prin_globals_init_helper` since it does not appear in the stack trace in the default (non-debug) CLN build.

That sounds like it disables *a lot* of cases in bulk... you can't suppress by library name instead of by symbol?

According with the [docs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer#suppressions) it depends on the stack trace, and the one without the debug symbols does not provide too much info to match against it.
```
The pattern will be substring-matched against the symbolized stack trace of the leak.
```

The actual stack trace is just:
```
