Fixes #13890

- Should "default" visibility be accepted? Is it equivalent to public or do we want public to be explicit?
- I'm not sure why, but some test fail ... can you help me identify why ?

> One thing. Not sure we'll actually accept this PR. What I said in [#13890 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13890#issuecomment-1405218045) was just my opinion and I started a discussion internally in the team to get a decision but looks like not everyone agrees that this is an acceptable feature. This will have to wait until we actually get some consensus in the team.

I fully understand. 

The  `good first issue candidate`, `low effort` and `low impact` labels made me think this was a good opportunity for me give it a try, and see if I can contribute to the compiler. If you end up doing it (which I hope) then maybe you'll appreciate having the PR ready. Otherwise no worry, I'd still be happy I gave it a try.

Sure, no worries. Thanks for taking the time anyway.

We actually introduced `good first issue candidate` at some point specifically because we had some issues that looked like it would be a `good first issue` eventually but were blocked for various reasons and had to be held back :) I did intend to make this one into that once it's accepted for implementation.

We're planning to restart the design calls in the coming weeks and do more decisions on pending issues. There was a lot of chaos in the last months so we have a bit of a backlog now.

While the changes make sense, it creates additional questions on whether the definition in the interface should be enforced in the contract that implements the interface. 

Currently when an interface defined an external function it can be implemented as external or public. If the interface allows for both external and public, should the contract enforce this?

IMO:
- functions declared as external in the interface can be implemented as either external or public
- functions declared as public in the interface can only be implemented as public.

This is already the way overriding works between (abstract) contracts:

```solidity
abstract contract AbstractPublic {
    function get() public virtual;
}

abstract contract AbstractExternal {
    function get() external virtual;
}

contract PublicPublic is AbstractPublic {
    function get() public override {} // ok
}

contract ExternalExternal is AbstractExternal {
    function get() external override {} // ok
}

contract ExternalPublic is AbstractExternal {
    function get() public override {} // ok
}
contract PublicExternal is AbstractPublic {
    function get() external override {} // TypeError: Overriding function visibility differs.
}
```

@NunoFilipeSantos This one is really blocked on a design decision rather than missing a review. @ekpyron was generally against it (there are some things we could potentially do as a part of #13727) but wanted to hear more opinions before we go for closing it: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13890#issuecomment-1408642168

We concluded that we won't merge this PR as is, but we acknowledge the underlying issue and hope to be able to provide better mechanisms around that with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13727, even though this will require a bit of more patience, for which I apologize.
