Workaround to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13891 by suppressing CLN memory leak errors in `t_ubu_asan_soltest` and `t_ubu_asan_cli`.

I tested it in a local docker image based on the current develop branch (commit `206e7cf`) with `-DSANITIZE=address` and `ASAN_OPTIONS="check_initialization_order=true:detect_stack_use_after_return=true:strict_init_order=true:strict_string_checks=true:detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2"` as done by the CI.

> I'm just gonna trust that you properly checked that this works, since it'll only show on nightly CI ;-).

Haha I updated the description with my test environment. But yeah, it seems to work :P
