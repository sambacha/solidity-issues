# [\#13908 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13908) `open`: Calls to attached functions in a library do not always match equivalent direct calls in terms of being internal/external
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `medium effort`, `low impact`

### Description
In Solidity we distinguish between internal and external library calls by whether the function is qualified with a library name or not. Generally, a qualified call (`L.f()`) is external while an unqualified one (`f()`) is internal. The only exception are internal functions - in that case `L.f()` is an internal call.

This behavior should be preserved when the function is attached via `using for`. Whether the call is internal or external should depend on whether `using {L.f}` or `using {f}` was used. Currently this is not the case - there is no difference between these two directives.

### How to reproduce

#### Public functions
Attached public functions are currently called externally (which is not allowed in libraries), even if unqualified in `using for`:
```solidity
library L {
    using {publicFunction} for uint;

    function publicFunction(uint) public pure {}

    function test(uint x) public pure {
        x.publicFunction(); // Error: Libraries cannot call their own functions externally.
        publicFunction(x);  // internal call
    }
}
```
`x.publicFunction()` here should be an internal call as well and compile without errors.


#### Private functions
Attached private functions are always called internally, even if qualified in `using for`:
```solidity
library L {
    using {L.privateFunction} for uint;

    function privateFunction(uint) private pure {}

    function test(uint x) public pure {
        x.privateFunction();  // internal call
        L.privateFunction(x); // Error: Member "privateFunction" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(library L).
    }
}
```
`x.privateFunction()` here should be an external call and produce a compilation error.

#### External functions
External library functions are currently not usable with `using for` (#13765) but after that's fixed (#13855), the following example is going to be inconsistent:

```solidity
library L {
    using {externalFunction} for uint;

    function externalFunction(uint) external pure {}

    function test(uint x) public pure {
        x.externalFunction(); // external call
        externalFunction(x);  // Error: Undeclared identifier. "externalFunction" is not (or not yet) visible at this point.
    }
}
```
`x.externalFunction()` here should be an external call and produce a compilation error.

### Specification
- Given `using {f}`, `x.f()` should be equivalent to `f()`.
- Given `using {L.f}`, `x.f()` should be equivalent to `L.f()`.
- Make sure the fix does not break functions qualified in different ways. For example `M.f()`, where `M` is a module and `f()` is a free function should always be an internal call.
- Calling the function in presence of conflicting directives (i.e. both `using {f}` and `using {L.f}` for the same type) should be an error.
    - Unless the function is internal. Then it is allowed.
    - To avoid introducing non-backwards-compatible changes, the error should be issued at the point of call. If the function is not actually called, it's not an error.
    - Note that the conflict may exist only in some scopes, not everywhere. E.g. if there is a file-level `using {L.f}` and one library has `using {L}` while another does not.
    - For the external case it would be fine to produce an error directly in the directive because such use currently an error (though this will change when #13765 is fixed).

Regarding the private variant, the alternative, non-breaking idea is to make private functions work the same way internal ones do. I.e. both `using {L.f}` and `using {f}` would work for them and `x.f()` would always resolve into an internal call. This one would also require making it possible to call private functions via `L.f()` inside the library that defines them, which is currently a compilation error.

I think it's more likely that we'll choose this way so I'd suggest implementing that, keeping in mind that we might change that decision on the next design call.

We did not make a concrete decision on the call today but the general sentiment was that libraries with external functions are something that needs to be deprecated and replaced with something better and it's not worth putting time into straightening the kinks of the current implementation.
