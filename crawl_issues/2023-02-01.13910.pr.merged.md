Is this meant to fix the crash we had in nightly today? Why does it help?

Yes, the idea was to not print the AddressSanitizer suppress statistics in the cli tests (https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer#flags) so the output could be correctly checked (https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/28328/workflows/e959d2e2-22b1-427f-9f59-c4bf76d60d85/jobs/1257155).

However I just tested it here, and it actually returns an non-zero exit code (apparently even if suppressed it still considered an error, and thus other tests fail anyway). So I need to find another way to fix this.

```

This will actually work if we pass an absolute path to the file with the suppression rules. The problem with my previous local attempt was that I provided the relative path to the file, so the cmdlineTests could not find it because the script changes directory while running and it was looking at `build/solc` directory instead of the repo root.
Passing the absolute path, fixed the problem. You can check it yourself running the following docker image:

```dockerfile
FROM solbuildpackpusher/solidity-buildpack-deps@sha256:07419ed58537cbca9d4c30701fb84f6bb517ce2fce7f3b5dccb3db8bf1c30183

RUN git clone https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git && \
    mkdir -p solidity/build; \
    cd solidity/build; \
    cmake .. -DSANITIZE=address; \
    make -j2
RUN ASAN_OPTIONS="check_initialization_order=true:detect_stack_use_after_return=true:strict_init_order=true:strict_string_checks=true:detect_invalid_pointer_pairs=2"; \
    TERM=xterm LSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=/solidity/.circleci/cln-asan.supp:print_suppressions=0" /solidity/test/cmdlineTests.sh
    # Comment the line above and uncomment the below to see the error
    # TERM=xterm /solidity/test/cmdlineTests.sh
```
And build it like so:
```
docker build --force-rm --tag asan-cli-test --file Dockerfile.asan-cli .
```
