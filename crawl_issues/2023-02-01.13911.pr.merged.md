There are two other broken links:
- https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019
    - MS changes this all the time. Not sure it's even still available.
- https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/16c5f09109c793db99fe35f037c6092b061bd39260ee7a677c8a97f18c955ab1/
    - Not sure if the gateway is just temporarily down or if we have to find a new one.

There are also a few more redirects, where I'm not sure if we should switch the link or not (e.g. `spdx.org` is now apparently `spdx.dev` for some files we link to but some are still served from the old domain). Probably not something we want to sort out just before the release.

They changed their gateway a while ago: https://gateway.ethswarm.org/access

But if we are using the old swarm client it will not be compatible anymore. The new client is called [bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee), and it requires a very different setup than the previous swarm versions. Even the hashes algorithms used changed, I think (not sure).

We may need to update solc-bin to use this instead: https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-js/blob/master/src/chunk/bmt.ts#L27
