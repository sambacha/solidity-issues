It also drops the `Solidity Upgrade Tool` bug fix notice since the tool was also removed in this release.

> You did not set the date and update the bug list.

 Yes, I thought that this should be done after, according with the instructions the first commit comes before the date update.
 
 ```
 - [ ] Make sure that all merged PRs that should have changelog entries do have them.
 - [ ] Sort the changelog entries alphabetically and correct any errors you notice. Commit it.
 - [ ] Update the changelog to include a release date.
 - [ ] Run ``scripts/update_bugs_by_version.py`` to regenerate ``bugs_by_version.json`` from the changelog and ``bugs.json``.  Make sure that the resulting ``bugs_by_version.json`` has a new, empty entry for the new version.
 - [ ] Commit changes, create a pull request and wait for the tests. Then merge it.
 ```
 
 But I will do it now ;)

Yeah, but you can have multiple commits in one PR :)

I mean, we can do it in separate PRs as well, that's how we used to do it. But there's no need to. You can include all of it in the same PR as long as it's separated into commits properly.

I missed the first one. But am I looking at it right, and it was added 5 years ago? Why should it be announced in this release? Or were you referring to some of the EOF experimental stuff and just pasted the wrong PR number?

I didn't include the second one because I thought there was no need to mention, but I can include it as well.

Ah, wait. No. Of course don't add it. It's something ancient that was added ages ago. I was going through the list of merged PRs and it's sorted approximately chronologically but not by merge time. I have no idea why it popped up there. It looked suspiciously like something we already have but I did not look too deep into it. I should have :)

I'm fine not adding it. Just thought I'd see other opinions though.
