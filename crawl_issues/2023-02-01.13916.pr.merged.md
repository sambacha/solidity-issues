According to the style guide, there should be no spaces between the `mapping` keyword and types.

In the 0.8.18 release, new [mapping-types docs](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/87f61d960cceab32489350726a99c050e6f92c61/docs/types/mapping-types.rst) do include spaces, which I deleted.

Reviewing all the docs, there are some similar cases on other pages, which I also corrected.
