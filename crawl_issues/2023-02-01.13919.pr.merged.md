This helps suppressing the following message during compilation:

```
/builddir/build/BUILD/solidity-0.8.18/libsolutil/Common.h:55:27: error: 'uint8_t' was not declared in this scope
   55 | using bytes = std::vector<uint8_t>;
      |                           ^~~~~~~
/builddir/build/BUILD/solidity-0.8.18/libsolutil/Common.h:49:1: note: 'uint8_t' is defined in header '<cstdint>'; did you forget to '#include <cstdint>'?
   48 | #include <functional>
  +++ |+#include <cstdint>
   49 | #include <string>
```

Done.
 
> By the way, what platform/compiler do you use? I wonder why none of these we use in CI is pointing it out as a problem.

GCC 13.0.1 with -Werror turned on.
