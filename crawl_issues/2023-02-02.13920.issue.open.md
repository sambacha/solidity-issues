### Description
`pragma solidity` allows version ranges (e.g. `0.8.17-0.8.20`) and using comparison operators before a single version (e.g. `<0.8.17` or `=0.8.20`). Unfortunately it looks like a combination of the two is also allowed, which makes no sense: `<0.8.17 - =0.8.20`.

In version ranges the operator is simply ignored and replaced with `>=` for the first component and `<=` for the second one: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ddbef8f65092cd09422366881d0fc1dad5d4b64e/liblangutil/SemVerHandler.cpp#L209-L215

### How to reproduce
This pragma will match `0.8.17`, `0.8.18`, `0.8.19` and `0.8.20`:
```solidity
pragma solidity <0.8.17 - >0.8.20;
```

> ```solidity
> pragma solidity <0.8.17 - >0.8.20;

This feels unintuitive. I would expect

- `pragma solidity >=0.8.17 <=0.8.20;` to match `0.8.17`, `0.8.18`, `0.8.19` and `0.8.20` (inclusive range)
- `pragma solidity >0.8.17 <0.8.20;` to match `0.8.18` and `0.8.19` (exclusive range)
- `pragma solidity <0.8.17 >0.8.20;` to match nothing (no version is both smaller than `0.8.17` and also bigger than `0.8.20`)

It does work the way you say. But it's not what the issue is about. Note the `-` there in my example. It's a range of versions and for a range having these prefix operators is weird and unintuitive. The solution here is to disallow the use of these operators with version ranges.

Well, there's a PR by @eduardfina that's almost finished: #13979.
It has not had any activity in more than a month though so feel free to take it over and finish it if you want.
