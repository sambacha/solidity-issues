## Description

While installing the new Solidity version `0.8.18` (via `solc-select`) on my WSL instance that uses `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` I ran into the following problem:

```bash
~$ solc-select install 0.8.18
Installing '0.8.18'...
Version '0.8.18' installed.

~$ solc-select use 0.8.18
Switched global version to 0.8.18

~$ solc --version
/home/user/.solc-select/artifacts/solc-0.8.18/solc-0.8.18: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.32' not found (required by /home/user/.solc-select/artifacts/solc-0.8.18/solc-0.8.18)
/home/user/.solc-select/artifacts/solc-0.8.18/solc-0.8.18: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.33' not found (required by /home/user/.solc-select/artifacts/solc-0.8.18/solc-0.8.18)

```

For `0.8.17` everything works as intended, so I guess the binaries have been built using a too recent version of `GLIBC` that is not yet supported. Not sure how to fix this tbh. FYI, on Windows everything works smoothly.

I can reproduce that with docker, so it's not specific to WSL (see below). We switched to building the Linux version on Ubuntu 22.04 in this release. Some time ago we added a mechanism to load Z3 dynamically (#10483) so the binary is no longer completely static and glibc is actually linked dynamically. This appears to be an incompatibility caused by that.

We maintain the [`ethereum/ethereum-static`](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static) PPA that provides completely static builds that should work on any Ubuntu version (see below).

Still, the main argument in #10483 was that glibc should be compatible way back to 2.14, released in 2011 and it's unlikely to break compatibility again.  @ekpyron, did they actually break compatibility now?

### Installing from our PPA
```bash
apt install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-static
apt install solc
```

### Repro with Docker
```bash
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:focal
```
```bash
apt update
apt install --assume-yes wget
cd /tmp
wget https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96
chmod +x solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96
./solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96 --version
```

Yes the PPA approach indeed works and is a temporary fix for anyone who wants to quickly install `0.8.18`. The problem is that I switch a lot between different solc versions (e.g. for reviewing different contracts, using slither on different repos etc.) and therefore I want to use the `solc-select` env. In any case, for the moment I can use Windows `solc-select` & solc `0.8.18` for which I obviously don't encounter this problem. But yes it seems some compatibility broke...

After discussing this with @ekpyron - looks like glibc indeed must have broken compatibility, which is a very rare thing. We'll need to discuss whether we want to continue with these not entirely static builds going forward.

For the moment, we're going to fix the problem with this particular release by rebuilding on 20.04 and swapping the binaries in the release.

@cameel thanks a lot for the swift action - yeah this is a really rare scenario and must be analysed in-depth.

The binary in solc-bin and on the github release page has been replaced (https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/129).

We also added [a note about it in the release blog post](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement/#update-2023-02-02-rebuilt-linux-binary-for-solidity-0818)

Would you be able to confirm that the new 0.8.18 binary should have a `sha256` hash of `0x95e6ed4949a63ad89afb443ecba1fb8302dd2860ee5e9baace3e674a0f48aa77`? 

On solc-select, we are executing checks against sha256 and keccak256. These are mismatched as below: 
```
sha256 from solidity lang website manifest: 0x95e6ed4949a63ad89afb443ecba1fb8302dd2860ee5e9baace3e674a0f48aa77

keccak256 from solidity lang website manifest 0x932901581a2ef0795851363522811fa160db5561e34cbb306e7105b6bbc3834d

```

I executed a manual test on the binary available at the [specified path](https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96), and I am still getting the old checksum. 
```

@0xicingdeath can confirm the same behaviour and actually pinged 5 mins ago @0xalpharush about that lol. You will always run into the following issue:

It's possible that the old binary is being cached and being sent back when we try to retrieve. I just tried a curl on the most recent binary and I am still getting the old `a1...bd` checksum: 
```
$ curl -o solc08 https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96

definitely cached imho - I just downloaded it and it works:

funny enough, if I use `solc-select` it somehow fails...

If I do `nix-prefetch-url --type sha256 https://binaries.soliditylang.org/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.8.18+commit.87f61d96` I still get the old hash which is `1g9jbh4xkg4yvyyzyr429xx7spg01qmzdv0rczsjcb28nhzg7h51`. I think that one should have changed as well in the meantime...

@pcaversaccio Built a hotfix into solc-select to let you use the most up to date solidity version. Checkout the latest `dev` otherwise 1.0.3 release for pip is also incoming https://github.com/crytic/solc-select

cool, will check it out. Btw now my error changed to a 404 error with the current `solc-select` version :)

Hi @0xicingdeath and @pcaversaccio yes, indeed it was a cache problem. We invalided the cache for this binary now. So it should be working. Sorry for that.

Interestingly that the CI test for dapptools is failing now in my PR: https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/pull/969. Using the "older" version it was successful...
