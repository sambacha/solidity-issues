Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13921.

Due to our recent migration to ubuntu 22.04 docker images and the fact that we dynamically load Z3 (and consequently glibc), we broke compatibility with ubuntu versions using old glibc. Thus, we need to rebuild the binaries on 20.04.

Closing since the updated binary has been added to solc-bin and github release page. The PR was not meant to be merged.
