### Description
When compilation fails due to an ICE or error at the code generation stage or later, Standard JSON still gives user some outputs, e.g. metadata, while the CLI does not. For consistency both should provide the same outputs.

One consequence of this inconsistent behavior is that ICEs [have to be ignored by `prepare_report.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.18/scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.py#L134-L140) and [by `prepare_report.js`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.18/scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.js#L75-L82) in our bytecode comparison. This potentially hides some ICEs that may happen only in the emscripten binary (e.g. #13924) - we won't detect such inconsistent ICEs otherwise because we don't run full test suite against the emscripten binary. We'll be able to remove this workaround when the problem is fixed.

Ensuring that all those inputs are getting printed correctly on the CLI is going to take some effort so my suggestion would be to fix it by just hiding all the outputs in case of an ICE or other such errors. They're unlikely to be of much use in that case anyway.

### How to reproduce
This applies at least to `UnimplementedFeatureError` (ICE), `CompilerError` (ICE), `CodeGenerationError` (error) but may also affect other types that just don't happen in any of our test cases currently.

#### Input
`test.sol`
```solidity
pragma solidity *;
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

contract C {
    uint immutable x;
    constructor() {
        x = 0;
        revert("");
    }
    function f() external view returns(uint) {
        return x;
    }
}
```
`test.json`
```json
{
    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {
        "test.sol": {"urls": ["test.sol"]}
    },
    "settings": {
        "outputSelection": {"*": { "*": ["metadata", "evm.bytecode"]}}
    }
}
```
#### CLI
```bash
solc test.sol --optimize --metadata --bin
```

Current output:
```
Error: Some immutables were read from but never assigned, possibly because of optimization.
```

#### Standard JSON
```bash
solc --standard-json test.json --json-indent 4 --allow-paths .
```
Current output:
```json

Is the example you provided above (CLI vs JSON) the expected outcome, or the current outcome? If it's the current outcome, then the error message is present in both cases and could technically be compared, or does CLI need to be enriched with more data for this to be possible? Also, perhaps these kinds of comparisons should be part of a different pipeline, since in case of ICE, no bytecode will be generated, and thus there is nothing to be compared, right?

It's the current output.

It's not about the error message (which is indeed present in both cases). It's that Standard JSON provides other outputs when the message is there while CLI does not. In particular the metadata, which we include in the bytecode report. So if there's an error we still have something to compare.

I mean, we could make the report script omit that info, but the root cause is really the inconsistent output. I'd rather fix that.

> Also, perhaps these kinds of comparisons should be part of a different pipeline

We could have a separate job that compiles all the bytecode snippets with emscripten binary and makes sure none of them fails. We already have that as a part of the bytecode check though so that's redundant and extra work.

I actually don't think we should fix this the way you suggest, especially separately from the CLI rewrite. I also don't see how this relates to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13924 - we don't need equalized outputs to check ICEs against ICEs.

It's related in the sense that the bytecode compare job should be able to detect such an ICE and flag that problem earlier but it did not due this issue. We did not have to skip ICEs if the output was consistent.

And it can be fixed completely independently of the rewrite. Putting everything off until the rewrite just makes it grow in scope and moves it further away. I think that problems that can be fixed independently, should be.

You're literally suggesting that rather than fixing bugs we should spend our time making them look nicer here. ICEs and other non-graceful errors are very much intentionally not handled more gracefully - for standard-json that's just not an option, since it'd break the usage side too severely. Still I don't see any benefit in spending time on "fixing" this (I'd not even say this is broken in the first place).

I just don't think that everything that currently counts as ICE should be handled in such a non-graceful manner. Assertions - yes, definitely, perfectly reasonable. Fail fast and fix them quickly. But `StackTooDeep`, `UnimplementedFeatureError`, `CodeGenerationError`? Those those are not failed assumptions but known limitations of the compiler. They should absolutely be handled in a more graceful manner. Users run into them all the time and often don't even know what to do with them. Tooling used to have problems parsing them too until they realized they do have to parse this output to detect running into those limitations (they should not have to). Treating them the same as failed asserts is just wrong.

In this particular case it makes our own infrastructure around the compiler more brittle than it needs to be. Fixing this is mostly a matter of making sure that we still print the outputs we already have, like metadata, even if such an error happens. I don't expect this in case of failed asserts (i.e. bugs) at all - we don't add test cases expected to fail on asserts anyway so it's not a concern. Only non-assert ICEs are.
