## Abstract

I found myself needing to reference another contract's events while writing unit tests in the Solidity language:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract Test {
    event MyEvent(uint256 index);

    function testingEvents() external returns (bytes32) {
        // Works
        return Test.MyEvent.selector;
    }

    function testingEvents2() external returns (bytes32) {
        // Works
        return MyEvent.selector;
    }
}


contract AnotherTest {
    function testingEvents() external returns (bytes32) {
        // Doesn't compile due to failed lookup of `MyEvent`.
        return Test.MyEvent.selector;
    }
}
```

I'm actually not sure whether to format this as a feature request or a bug :sweat_smile:

## Motivation

In the [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) framework, you can write unit tests with Solidity. If I want to filter events emitted in logs, I can hash the signature manually:
```solidity
bytes32 selector = keccak256("MyEvent(uint256)");
```

However, it would be cleaner to actually reference the event so it's harder for the selector definition to go stale:

```solidity
bytes32 selector = Test.MyEvent.selector;
```

## Specification

I don't think this introduces new syntax.

Regarding semantics, I'm personally only interested in being able to evaluate an event's selector.

However, I wouldn't know whether it makes sense to allow emission of foreign events in your own contract:

```solidity
contract Test {
    event MyEvent(uint256 index);
}


contract AnotherTest {
    function testingEvents() external returns (bytes32) {
        emit Test.MyEvent(5);
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Update: Actually, to assert that an event was emitted, [`expectEmit`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/expect-emit) is used, and it requires emitting the event with the expected arguments. So it does make sense to allow emitting foreign events in the context of test writing at least.

## Backwards Compatibility

As far as I can see, there should be no backwards incompatibility due to the fact that function, modifier, struct and event identifiers that overlap are disallowed. I might be missing something though.

This is already planned, but we need to have #13086 first. Which should happen pretty soon (it already has a pending PR).

We actually already have another issue covering this, so closing this one to keep discussions in a single place: #9737.

Ah wait, they're not the same. Still, the upcoming change will cover both because the main thing preventing us from having events at file level was the problem with referencing foreign events.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

This seems to be fixed in `0.8.25`. The code from the OP compiles without errors
