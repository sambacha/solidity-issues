Solidity generates an accessor method for every public member.
However, `abi.encodeCall` doesn't recognize this variable.



```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
// import 'hardhat/console.sol';

pragma solidity ^0.8.12;

contract Test {

    uint public val;
    constructor(uint x) {
        val = x;
    }
    function fun() public view returns(uint) { return val; }
}

contract Test1 {

    function test(Test a) internal view {
        a.val(); //successfully reference the variable as method
        a.fun();      
        abi.encodeCall(Test.fun, ());
	abi.encodeCall(Test.val, ()); // <== fails to compile
    }
 }
```

Hello i tried to look and learn about this error an found that , 
abi.encodeCall() function is used to encode a call to a specific function and not a state variable.

eg. uint public val; -> declared in the code snippet.
We can can use the abi.encodePacked() function instead to encode the val variable eg. abi.encodePacked(a.val).

Feel free to explain me as i am a beginner with opensource contributions and would love to learn more.

> abi.encodeCall() function is used to encode a call to a specific function and not a state variable.

`a.val` refers to the getter, not the the state variable (which is not accessible externally). @drortirosh has a point. You can assign it to a function pointer (which by the way would be the workaround for anyone running into this):

```solidity
contract C {
    uint public stateVariable;

    function test() public view {
        function () external view returns (uint) f = this.stateVariable;
        f();
    }
}
```

so you should be able to use it in `abi.encodeCall()` as well. It does have a proper function type. This is just a corner case we did not think about when adding `abi.encodeCall()` so basically a bug.
