I think it should be based on labels. I'd exempt `roadmap`, `selected-for-development`, `must have`, `must have eventually`. These are basically things we know we need for the language to be complete. Maybe also `should have` and `nice to have` because these are things we still and and we specifically know we won't have time to get to them soon. `epic` also sounds like it should be exempt.

I also added those for the reasons that you just gave. It does make sense to keep things we would like to have but do not have time right now to work on them.

Should we also disable debug?

Roadmap: 23
Must have: 40
Must have eventually: 51
Should have: 78
Nice to have: 51

Total 243 out of 835.

All the epics should be on the Roadmap, they don't make sense out of it. If they are out of it, they should be closed.

**Should have** and **nice to haves** should not be exempt these are exactly the cases where we're just hoarding stuff we will never do.
