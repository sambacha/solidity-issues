## Page
When the documentation is opened in small devices the screen started overflow like this.

## Abstract

I think there is an issue in CSS file. I made some changes and it's gone, but the link arrow to remix IDE is not visible properly. We can move it besides heading to solve this problem maybe.

Let me know how can we work on this ðŸ˜Š.

Hi @ShubhamWadne, thanks for reporting the problem.

I gave it a quick look, and it seems that the problem is indeed in our layout. The `remix-link-container` is set as a [paragraph tag](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c980e96b64f9f810f909d291791a1c421ffbf08d/docs/ext/remix_code_links.py#L40) positioned in the far right corner of a code block (see: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/_static/css/custom.css#L53), outside the total display area.

I think that if we want to display the open-in-remix arrow button on the side of the example code block, we should decrement the total size of the code block until it fits the link, inlining the `remix-link-container`, and maybe also making it a `div` instead of a `p`. Or we can convert the arrow button to a simple, but nicer, button and display it on top of the respective code block. Either options would be fine I guess.

If you would like to give it a try, please let's us know :)
