Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13948.

I just made some changes in CSS file and the result looks like this.
Let me know is this enough or suggest me something better is needed.

I think that we should change the arrow icon to button with text "open in remix", this give direct action to user instead of after hovering over arrow. We can change the p tag into button also solves styling issues. But the code is written in python and I am not  familiar with python I'm a javascript coder.

Regarding changing how this looks, we should get an opinion from @franzihei and @NunoFilipeSantos.

The Python part is really not that complicated, we can help you change it but I don't think it will really be a big problem once we know *what to change it to*. And that's the actual issue here - note that we don't have direct control over the generated HTML but we're dealing with [docutils](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/) API instead. And the API is defined in terms of an abstract document. This allows the docs to be easily rendered in other formats like PDF or ePUB as well. There may be no concept of anything button-like in these formats. See the list of [body elements](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html#body-elements) you can use.

How would a button look when exported to different formats?

It would be hidden in most of them. The extension I have written for rendering it specifically excludes everything that is not HTML. Also ePUB, which is technically HTML, but I just didn't want to spend time getting it exactly right there. As for other formats, we'd have to check which ones are also HTML-based but if it's rendering wrong, we can always exclude it. This is really meant only for HTML, but we still have to abide by the docutils API, which is more general than that.

The docutils API supports buttons, right? If so, I don't see any impediment to changing it to a button.

I don't see any mention of buttons under [body elements](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/doctree.html#body-elements). I only did a quick search though. There could be something button-like in there.

Ok so I think that we should let the arrow as it is and we can do something
like giving the margin to the code box on the right side and putting that
arrow sign in that space.This can also solve the problem. Just show me
where I should make a change to give that code box margin-right.

@ShubhamWadne, not sure if I follow, why would we need to do anything in python? I thought that you could just change the style of the link and its container, no? Like adjusting the `top` property and the margin/padding of the `remix-link-container` to position the link correctly in between paragraphs and changing the style of the `remix-link` like you did.

For reference, the generated HTML for that link looks like this:
```html
<p class="remix-link-container">
    <a class="remix-link reference external" href="https://remix.ethereum.org/...">
        <span class="link-icon"></span>
        <span class="link-text">open in Remix</span>
    </a>
</p>
```

> I think that we should change the arrow icon to button with text "open in remix", this give direct action to user instead of after hovering over arrow

About the tooltip message. I agree that it would not be necessary if we have a nice button saying `open in remix`. But this button should fit the layout of the docs. So if you have any idea for its design, please feel free to suggest it :)

If needed, I think you can add some custom javascript in [docs/_static/js](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/docs/_static/js) and add a listener on the hover event. Not sure if it is worth though. Maybe a nicer `open in remix` button is better? Any opinions on it?

> There may be no concept of anything button-like in these formats.

@cameel we can make the `<a>` tag looks like a button for the `remix-link` class by only changing its css.

To change the underlying HTML you'd have to change the Sphinx extension, which is written in Python.

Well, you could technically do that with some extra attached JS but I'd avoid adding another language to the mix. This is just a link, should not really need anything fancy other than styling.

> we can make the `<a>` tag looks like a button for the `remix-link` class by only changing its css.

I'll leave opinions about looks to the others, but just wanted to say I don't see anything wrong with this being styled as a link. Semantically it *is* a link. Things like being visited that apply to links, apply here too. Or with it being a link I'd normally middle-click it to open in a new tab, which is nice to have. With a button I wouldn't necessarily expect that I can do that.

Hi @RupeshWadne, no problem :)

>  I made my final changes but 2 checks are failing can anyone tell me what can I do now.

Don't worry, those tests are unrelated with your PR. The first one related with the `t_native_test_ext_gp2` test was fixed in the `develop` branch already. So you just need to rebase your branch onto the `develop` (check the git documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) if you have never done that).

For the second failed test (`t_native_test_ext_zeppelin`) we need to investigate what is happening, but you don't need to worry with it.

Hi @RupeshWadne thanks for the changes and sorry for the late reply, but the problems mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13951#pullrequestreview-1291038243 were not fixed. You can test it yourself by running `make html` under the `docs` directory and opening the docs in your browser, e.g. `chromium _build/html/index.html`

If it is the first time you build the docs locally, you can just run the script `docs/docs.sh` which will install the dependencies and build the docs as well.

Also, as mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13951#issuecomment-1425781032 we could just style it as links if that makes it easier to fix the problem.

Hum...as far as I'm aware Remix works on mobile as well, so I would say yes.

I'm fine to actually just do what @cameel suggested in this comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13951#issuecomment-1425781032:
```
I'll leave opinions about looks to the others, but just wanted to say I don't see anything wrong with this being styled as a link. 
```

And just make a link in the top right corner of the code block saying `open in remix` (or something like that) and we can move on with this PR.

@r0qs I wanted to say that being multi-featured is not necessarily good. In other words, I wanted to discuss once whether it is really necessary, not whether it works. If there are only a couple of mobile users in the world using this Remix button, I think the user experience of the majority of other users should be a priority.

Anyway, I wasn't aware of the existence of this button until you shared this issue. This is a matter of appearance, as @cameel said. I'll make a prototype now with an `open in Remix` button :)

@NunoFilipeSantos You are right but sorry, mobile devices here refer to small devices such as iPhones and don't include tablets such as iPads. This is because this broken layout doesn't happen by the size of the tablets.

By the way, #14122 has already supported small devices. I just thought it would be easier to hide it for this issue, which is why I made that suggestion. :)
