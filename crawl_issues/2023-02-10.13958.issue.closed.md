**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

## Solidity v0.8.0 Breaking Changes

<!--Link to the page https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/080-breaking-changes.html-->

## The changes in the exponentiation expression

<!--Please describe in detail what is wrong.-->

The changes on the exponentiation on v0.8.0 was changed to be right associative operand expression from the previous (which was left associative operand) as shown on the documentation here https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/080-breaking-changes.html

This is to ask for more clarification of these two statements changes you provided:

> Exponentiation is right associative, i.e., the expression `a**b**c` is parsed as `a**(b**c)`. Before 0.8.0, it was parsed as `(a**b)**c`.

While in the updates it says:

> Change `x**y**z` to `(x**y)**z`.

## Clarification

<!--Please link to your pull request which resolves this issue.-->

Is it correct or should the update be `x**(y**z)` instead?

It is correct. It tells you to change `x**y**z` to `(x**y)**z` to preserve the old behavior. If you don't do that, it will be interpreted as `x**(y**z)`, changing the meaning of your code, which most likely was written with the assumption that it means `(x**y)**z`.
