Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13892

It requires the PAT named `PROJECT_BOARD_AUTOMATION` with the following permissions:
```
repo
read:project
```

Unassigning @matheusaaguiar. Looks like I assigned him yesterday by accident instead of adding him as a reviewer :) Sorry for the confusion.

Just realized now that as we are migrating from the classic GH project API we could actually just use the [actions/add-to-project](https://github.com/actions/add-to-project ). The configuration would be much simpler and we would not be required to deal directly with the graphql API. Anyway, either will work, so I can replace the action by something like below and activate the `Item added to project` workflow in the project settings if you think it is better to outsource the maintenance of this action:
```yml
jobs:
  add-to-project:
    name: Add issue ${{ github.event.issue.number }} to Triage column
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/add-to-project@v0.4.0
        with:
          project-url: https://github.com/orgs/${{ env.ORGANIZATION }}/projects/${{ env.PROJECT_NUMBER }}
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_BOARD_AUTOMATION }}
```
However, using the graphql API directly give us more control over the project boards and allows us to manage everything from one place (i.e. the action config).

@r0qs It's failing: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/actions/runs/4808604722/jobs/8558790280

Maybe the token is outdated after all?

By the way, we should switch this to non-dry run because it's not "dry" anyway. Merging this PR disabled the old mechanism and we have nothing in place.

Yes, it looks liked. Can you renew it and ensure that it has the following permissions?
```
repo
read:project
```
