While it's good to keep one sentence per line for easier reviewing, especially if just one sentence is altered, I think it might make sense to break them over two or more lines if they get a bit too long.

Please cite reference to /STYLE-GUIDE.md of the decision we can use going forward here.

Or can quickly make that file with just this one sentence.

Not sure what you mean. What is `STYLE-GUIDE.md`?

Right. That's a file with the answer to our question here. 

We need to make that file real quick. (Separate PR)

When we have it, everyone can use it (eventually whenever they have time). And it will save people time by its very existence.

@fulldecent for now it's best we focus on fixing the existing PR, even if we decide to adapt this later to the `STYLE-GUIDE.md`.
