Fixes #13901.

The issue here is that the `lhsResolved` pointer may be null, and the code is dereferencing it without checking for null. To fix the bug, we can add a null check before accessing `lhsResolved`. If `lhsResolved` is null, an error is reported using `m_errorReporter.reportErrors` and the function returns immediately. This ensures that the code will not attempt to dereference a null pointer, preventing a potential null dereference error.

`m_errorReporter.reportErrors` increments the error count `m_errorCount` and adds the error message to the list of errors m_errors.

Thank you for your contribution! Were you able to find a case where the pointer is actually null? If not, then it is probably better to use an assertion instead. The way the error is reported now it looks like it is a user error, not a compiler bug.

This code throws an error Null dereference.
```solidity
contract C{
    bool x;
    function fallback() external {
      ((), x) &= ((), false);
    }
}
```

Because it is trying to perform a bitwise AND operation on a null reference, which will cause a "Null dereference". 
If I understand correctly, the pointer is actually null.

I'm wondering if this is actually true. Did you manage to get the `null dereference` error compiling this? Maybe what @chriseth suggested is actually better, and we could just have an assertion there.

I only got the expected errors when compiling your example with the current solc version in the `develop` branch. Am I missing something?
```

Error: Empty tuple on the left hand side.

Error: Compound assignment is not allowed for tuple types.
 --> a.sol:6:7:

  |       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Error: Tuple component cannot be empty.
 --> a.sol:6:19:

  ```

I have come to the conclusion that this is a user error, not a compiler error. For these reason, I've decided to close this pull request.
