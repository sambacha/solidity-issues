Running `solcjs --bin --optimize Test.sol` produces the following:

However, running `solc --bin Test.sol` will successfully compile the program. Furthermore, the produced binary executes successfully using evmone.

[Test.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/files/10722655/Test.txt) contains the solidity code. What is interesting is that I can comment out functions `f4` and `f5`, and `solcjs` will still reject the program. However, if I replace the commented out functions with repeating simple line comments e.g. `// // comment` then `solcjs` will successfully compile it. Here is [comment.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/files/10722701/comment.txt).

I see that [this comment](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/issues/543#issuecomment-1093632970) suggests a memory access error is related to exceeding the Solidity maximum contract size, however, clearly there is a discrepancy between the behaviour of `solc` and `solcjs`. I don't know if this discrepancy is intended.

```
$ solcjs --version
0.8.16+commit.07a7930e.Emscripten.clang

$ lsb_release -a | grep "Description"
Description:	Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS

Thanks for the report! I can confirm that this is reproducible with node v16.19.0 and Solidity 0.8.18 as well.

The discrepancy is definitely not intended. It might be coming from the fact that `soljson.js` is compiled to 32-bit wasm. It can address less memory so it could just be running out of it earlier than `solc`, which is a 64-bit binary.

> What is interesting is that I can comment out functions `f4` and `f5`, and `solcjs` will still reject the program.

Here is [comment.txt](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/files/10722701/comment.txt).

This sounds like the issue is in processing long comments. By switching to line comments, you're basically breaking a single huge multi-line comment into lots of small comments that will be processed separately. The file is 1.6 MB so the comment can't possibly be long enough to actually exhaust available memory but maybe e.g. the regex parser we use is not particularly efficient. We do have issue reports related to that already: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12208.

> Furthermore, the produced binary executes successfully using evmone.

Yeah, this part is not surprising since it's a crash during compilation. Still, good to know.

> However, running `solc --bin Test.sol` will successfully compile the program. 

Interestingly, I managed to crash `solc` as well but only with the new codegen:
```bash
solc Test.txt --via-ir
```
And then only on a release build. A recent build from `develop` does not crash this way, so I could not check where the stack trace leads to. It looks similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13496 though.

In any case, this does look like a bug. I'm going to transfer the issue to the main repo because the crash is clearly inside the binary and not in the JS code.

@cameel out of interest, which release build could you crash using the `via-ir` flag?

I used the Linux release binary for 0.8.18.

> Just in case the initial report wasn't clear, I can still trigger this without the large comment i.e. the Test.txt file contained a program without comments.

Oh, you mean it's still reproducible without the comment? To be honest, I only quickly triaged it, I did not investigate what exactly is the cause but from your description and the effects I observed the huge comment seemed like a reasonable guess.

> Oh, you mean it's still reproducible without the comment?

Yes with solcjs it can be reproduced using just Test.txt which contains no comments. I just thought it was surprising that a) commenting out a big chunk made no difference and then b) if I changed the comments from being commented out code e.g.
```
// int x;
// x+= 2
//....
```
to
```
// comment
// comment
// comment
```
Then the problem no longer happened.

ok so that's probably not just the comment then.

I investigated this now and I think we're just running into the limits of the 32-bit memory space. It seems to be simply because of now much memory solc eats to process such a big contract. Not saying it cannot be improved to use less RAM but that would be just a matter of better optimization and not really a bugfix.

I confirmed this by trying to remove as much as possible from `Test.txt`. At first I was able to remove quite a few blocks and then removing anything would resolve the crash. Then I started duplicating a single line to compensate for removed code and with enough repetition the crash always returned. When copies of that lime became the only content of the file I started simplifying it, each time replicating it more and more times until I got to the simple `0;` repeated 200k times. This still reproduces the error:

```bash
{
    printf 'function f() {'
    for i in {1..200000}; do
        printf '    0;\n'
    done
    printf '}'
} > input.sol
npx solcjs --bin input.sol
```

Further proof is that simply removing the indent from the above makes the crash go away. But then increasing the loop count to 800k brings it back again. It's just the memory overhead of processing such a big file.

It's very possible you could crash `solc` that way too if you gave it a file that's large enough but you'd also have to have a ton of RAM. I tried giving it ~200 MB of input but I had to kill it when it ate 60 GB RAM and was still going.

So it seems to be more of a performance issue. It's not great that wasm is so limited because we always consider it as the canonical build you could use anywhere. But we might have to just live with it until 64-bit wasm becomes a thing.

@ekpyron @axic Do you think we can do anything concrete here or should we close this as "wontfix"? tl;dr is that extremely large `.sol` files given as input make the wasm binary run out of memory and crash.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.

For anyone running into this error, the actual solution is to upgrade to 0.8.28. With #15451 memory use went down significantly, even as much as 80% in some cases.

Between 0.8.21 and 0.8.27 memory usage jumped a lot due to some artifacts not being generated on demand, which we noticed only recently (see benchmarks: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15561#issuecomment-2451128725). Now that I think of it, it must have been the underlying cause of this issue too. I mean, the example is quite contrived and if you make it large enough, you'll still reach the bounds of available memory eventually, but it should not have been happening that easily.

And if anyone is still having memory problems even on 0.8.28+ (in real-life, non-contrived cases), please report that as a bug. The compiler is designed to cache most artifacts but it does it in a very simplistic way and they accumulate during compilation of large projects. It has never been seen as much of a problem, but some bigger projects I've seen do need 5+ GB of RAM even with the fix from #15451. With some effort the compiler stack could be redesigned to free unused artifacts earlier, but optimizing that won't be high on our priority list unless it's actually affecting users in practice.
