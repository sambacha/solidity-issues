Added labels to all the templates as well as descriptions.

Next step:
- Mandatory fields.

This pull request is stale because it has been open for 14 days with no activity.
It will be closed in 7 days unless the `stale` label is removed.

Someone who has an alt account at hand should also check if labels actually get added when you submit an issue without write access to the repo.

Not simply delete. Note that the new templates do not cover all the stuff that's in there.

It took me 30 seconds to fix with @r0qs suggestion. You're awesome!
