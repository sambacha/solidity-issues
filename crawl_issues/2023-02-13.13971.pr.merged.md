# [\#13971 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13971) `merged`: Improve error messages for wrong constructor arguments

Fixes #13824.

This tweaks error messages in two cases:
- Now a better error message is reported when arguments for base contract constructor are not given.
    - Until now it resulted in an error implying that the constructor is an unimplemented method.
    - The treatment of this class of errors was inconsistent. When an empty argument list was given on the modifier list of the constructor, a proper error about wrong number of arguments was issued. Same in case of wrong but non-zero number of arguments. Only specifically an empty argument list on an inheritance list had this effect.
    - Due to this the constructor will no longer appear in the `unimplementedDeclarations` annotation. Not sure if I should list this as an AST change but I think we do not expose the AST in case of compilation errors (unless via Standard JSON?) so it should not affect tooling.
- Removed the hint to remove the argument list from the constructor when the list is non-empty. A non-empty list clearly indicates that the intention was to perform initialization.
