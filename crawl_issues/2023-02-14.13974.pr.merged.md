**Labels**: `smt`

Without path condition, verification targets created inside ternary operator ignore the condition of the operator inside the branches. 
Similarly, function calls inside ternary operator ignore the condition.
This led to false positives.

The proposed solution is to include the path condition as part of the constraint on the edge leading to the error block.

Fixes #10876.

Can you also add a test that has nested ternary operators and only an innermost triggers a target?
