Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13975

This PR adds a workaround to skip the failed external tests that I could reproduce.

Note that as the tests randomly fail, we may need to skip the whole governor tests or all the ones that is using the openzeppelin's [test/helpers/time.js](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/test/helpers/time.js).

The problem is already being fixed by openzeppelin though. See https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/4046 for reference.

Should be fixed upstream now.

Already have a branch with it but now solcjs decided to crash: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/28527/workflows/da301c52-c14b-45f2-9632-f2e1133b5b63/jobs/1266470
