Fixes #13920 

When pragma is using version ranges (-) it doesn't allow to use prefixing operators (<, <=, >=, >, ^).

You should also add some tests.

I agree with @matheusaaguiar's comments about using `ranges::find_if` and doing the comparison directly (i.e. removing `containPrefixingToken` function) . To give you some directions about the tests, you will need to add some syntax tests at `test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/pragma`, see this one as example: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/pragma/invalid_range_conjunction_two_ranges.sol

Thank you so much for the feedback, I agree with all you said.
I was thinking about including the = too, but I didn't know if it would be correct
I'm new at Solidity development and I'm still understanding how it all works.
I'll make the changes as soon as possible!

It looks like this PR is still in progress, so we're converting it back to a draft.

I modified the code to match with the feedback, I had to adapt some things:

1- I deleted the function containPrefixingToken() and added an inline if to detect the prefix.
2- I evaluate the components prefix to validate before changing it to the range prefix at the function parseMatchExpression.
3- I couldnâ€™t find an easy way to include the = to the invalid operators because at the function parseMatchComponent() the default value is Assign (=), making like if all the components without operator had an =. On the other hand I think it could not damage having the possibility of using = in a range (ex. pragma solidity =0.8.17 - 0.8.20;)
4- I left the function isPragmaOp(), we canâ€™t use isCompareOp because itâ€™ll wrongly compare != and == too.
5- I didnâ€™t refactor the function isPragmaOp() to isAllowedInPragma() because the operator = is also allowed and is not part of the condition.
6- I added some tests 3 invalid and 2 valid.

Also I don't know if I should do it but I updated the code to the last develop version before the commit.

Waiting for feedback, thank you!

Yeah, please keep it updated, but we use rebase for that. No need for merge commits that obscure history :)

Please use the `Fixes #13920` form. This way github will close the issue automatically once we merge the PR.

@veniger are you still up for working on this on the side :-)?
