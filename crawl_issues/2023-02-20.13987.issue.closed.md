[Our CircleCI command for posting notifications to the #solidity-dev gitter channel](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.18/.circleci/config.yml#L34-L93) stopped posting last week. This is certainly due to the recent migration of Gitter channels to Matrix:

[Gitter is going fully native Matrix in Feb. 2023](https://blog.gitter.im/2023/01/16/gitter-is-going-fully-native-matrix-in-feb-2023/)
> Because we will be invalidating all access tokens on Gitter, this means that any bots/scripts that use the Gitter API will stop working. You can prepare for the new Matrix world by adapting your code to use https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/. You wonâ€™t have access to all of your Gitter data to test against before the cutover but testing against your own Matrix sandbox room should be sufficient for any use case.

This means we need to fix it now. We could try simply updating the token, but I suspect that won't be enough and we actually have to rewrite it to use the new API. Fortunately, the new API is a REST API as well, so we may be be able to get away with still making HTTP requests with `curl` rather than doing something more complicated.
