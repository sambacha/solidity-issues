Oh wow - ``âˆ’10,479`` lines :-D? That's more than I'd have thought :-D .
But yeah - we can do this in a non-breaking release, but we should at least note it in the changelog :-).

Docs will also need to be updated, but surprisingly, it's only 4 files from what I can tell
```
contributing.rst
installing-solidity.rst
using-the-compiler.rst
yul.rst
```

I'd consider merging this without the docs changes, to do them separately later - but it at least needs a rebase to solve the changelog conflict. Ideally, of course, also the docs changes :-).

Is there anything left here besides a Changelog-rebase?

I think: nope.

I'd merge this, but it still has conflicts and a broken Changelog diff :-).

Shouldn't this also have been removed? https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/remove-ewasm-backend/test/ExecutionFramework.cpp#L66
i.e.:
```solidity
	for (auto const& path: m_vmPaths)
		if (EVMHost::getVM(path.string()).has_capability(EVMC_CAPABILITY_EWASM))
			m_supportsEwasm = true;
```

Apart from the evmone versions having gotten reverted (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13998#discussion_r1189077489) and this one test behaving weirdly and I'm not exactly sure why: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13998#discussion_r1189086421, I'd actually say we can merge this, too - I've looked through the entire monster once and that's the only things I spotted that were out of line.
