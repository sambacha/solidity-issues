Reverts https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13781
since it causes issues like https://launchpadlibrarian.net/652849231/buildlog_ubuntu-focal-amd64.solc_1%3A0.8.19-0ubuntu1~focal_BUILDING.txt.gz

A build against the old script works (https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum/+build/25613224) - so since upgrading this doesn't actually bring much of a real advantage, we'll downgrade again until we drop focal support.
