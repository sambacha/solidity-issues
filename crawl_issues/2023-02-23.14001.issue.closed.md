```
contract C {
  int8 public s = -1;
}
```

derefs null pointer here

Repro requires solc compiled with UBSan

True, `_operation.userDefinedFunctionType()` is `nullptr` when the operator is built-in, so accessing `returnParameterTypes()` on it is a null dereference. Interestingly, it does not seem to crash, which is why it slipped through. Could be because we only ever touch the value it returns in the non-null case.

Still, it's clearly a bug and should be fixed. It would normally be more serious, but fortunately until we see an actual crash in a release binary the impact is low.

Just for completeness, here's how to reproduce it with the example from the description (named `test.sol` here):

```bash
cmake -DSANITIZE=undefined -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
make
solc/solc test.sol
```
Output:
```
