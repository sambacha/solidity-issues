Before we have CI fully handle solc-bin binaries, as described in #13610, we could do a simpler intermediate step towards it that would already make the releases simpler. The idea would be to create a script that downloads the binaries from CI, adds them to a local checkout of `solc-bin`, runs the `update` script and posts a PR to github. The script could also upload the binaries to github release page.

We would later use that script in CI as a part of #13610.

Another thing to watch out for - the step should probably use `node@16`, since I had issues with 18.
