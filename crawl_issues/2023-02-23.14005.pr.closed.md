The explanation on the `delete` keyword used on arrays was a bit confusing, added an explanation that for both static and dynamic arrays the `delete` keyword will iterate over each element and `delete` them as well

@NunoFilipeSantos This still needs to be addressed: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14005#discussion_r1149201740

Unfortunately, I don't know off the top of my head if it's just a memory vs storage difference or if it's also a difference between codegens (or maybe even between types, but this is unlikely). In any case, the text was correct and with the clarification it's not necessarily so. We need to dig into the code and check what the situation is to qualify the statement properly.

Unfortunately I don't think spending more time on it makes sense.

Feel free to reopen if you (or anyone else) can check the code for what the current state of this is and make it accurate, but as is the clarification is incorrect and I think that merging it would be worse than leaving it as is.
