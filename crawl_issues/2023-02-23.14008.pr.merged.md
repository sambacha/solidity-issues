# [\#14008 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14008) `merged`: Uniform naming convention for github labels
**Labels**: `has dependencies`

Related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13970#discussion_r1115832284

I renamed most labels to use a uniform naming convention, so that it's harder to make a mistake in GH actions when refering to them:
- `Feature Request` -> `feature`
- `fuzz-blocker` -> `fuzz blocker`
- `Needs Investigation` -> `needs investigation`
- `solc-bin` -> `solcbin`
- `solc-js` -> `solcjs`
- `via-IR` -> `via ir`

That did not require code changes.

The `hacktoberfest-accepted` was not changed because that's the Hackoberfest requirement.

There are, however, also some labels that existing actions already refer to. This PR updates them. **We should rename those labels and merge the PR simultaneously**.
- `selected-for-development` -> `selected for development`
- `closed-due-inactivity` -> `closed due inactivity`
- `SMT` -> `smt`

Spaces make URLs readability complicated. Example:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+investigation%22
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aclosed-due-inactivity

We should also remove emojis from labels.

I agree and I would not mind having it the other way around, but that would be a lot more renaming and these labels may be embedded in a lot more places. This change was simpler. Also, we've been using this convention for a while now so just sticking to it everywhere would at least not introduce any problems we did not already have.

Also, there are some labels with spaces that we'd need anyway. E.g. `good first issue` gets those issues listed on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/contribute/ and I think that switching to `good-first-issue` would break that. We could make it an exception like `hacktoberfest-accepted` I guess but there may be some other labels like this that I'm not aware of.

> We should also remove emojis from labels.

They look nice and they're basically an inside joke so I don't mind them, but I don't care much about them either. If we removed them, labels would be easier to remember and type by hand so I'd be fine with that.

~Also, remember to change the labels here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/labels, for instance: `closed-due-inactivity`~ Just noticed that you already mentioned that in the end of the PR description...

This pull request is stale because it has been open for 14 days with no activity.
It will be closed in 7 days unless the `stale` label is removed.

Labels renamed.
