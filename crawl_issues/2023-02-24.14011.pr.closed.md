Thus suppress the following issue when compiling with -Werror=overloaded-virtual:

Hi @lemenkov ! ðŸ‘‹ are you planning to come back soon to this PR, or should we close it for now?

This one technically is still waiting for a review from our side, but IIRC @nikola-matic looked into it already. I think that we figured out that what the code was doing with `==` operators was just wrong and this PR only makes the errors go away without actually fixing the underlying issue. It was pretty tedious to fix though.

@nikola-matic What was the conclusion of that discussion?

Thanks for the follow-up! Feel free to close it if you find a proper solution. The only thing I'd love to have is the backlink from the commit to this PR :)

Heya @lemenkov and sorry for the (very) delayed answer.
In any case, as @cameel mentioned, your fix does make the warning go away - but in this case, the warning is actually valid. There are 6 classes/structs in `Sorts.h` that derive from `struct Sort`, but only 2 of them throw this warning, namely, because they're not overriding the `Sort::operator==`, but are rather introducing a new operator overload specific to the class itself, i.e. `IntSort` and `BitVector`, which in essence is hiding the base operator, as the warning indicates.

The way this should be implemented is exactly like the rest of the derived classes that don't throw this warning, e.g. [`ArraySort`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsmtutil/Sorts.h#L117). As you can see, the `operator==(Sort&)` is properly overridden (this makes the warning go away), and then a base comparison is made, after which the `_other` is downcast to the derived class, where the derived class specific members are then individually compared.

I'll therefore be closing this PR (but please continue to contribute, as I do remember a few of your previous fixes were very useful :)). Also pinging @leonardoalt in case he wants to open an issue, or fix this himself, or something entirely.

@nikola-matic thanks for the explanation!
