[`scripts/build.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/build.sh) at a glance looks like a simple helper to build the compiler from source. However, it also attempts to install the built binary system-wide, which is completely unexpected. It may also overwrite a binary someone installed in `/usr/local/bin/` from a different source.

The script is recommended as a part of our instruction to install from source: [Command-Line Build](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#command-line-build).

I think the script is at the very least confusing, if not outright dangerous. We should either remove the install part from it or rename it to make its purpose clearer.

Decision after discussing this: we should remove the script and put the instructions directly in the docs. This is in line with the plan to eventually clean the `scripts/` directory or rarely used stuff of questionable usefulness.

PR above had some issues, will re-send one in a bit! Would probably also make sense to allow for a flag `--install-to=<PATH>` for better DX.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
