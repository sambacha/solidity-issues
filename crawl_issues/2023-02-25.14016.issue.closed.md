Interesting. It actually triggers an exception inside STL:
```
Uncaught exception:
Dynamic exception type: std::logic_error
std::exception::what: basic_string::_M_construct null not valid
```
And it's unrelated to the fact that the directive is truncated. The full form causes the same crash:
```solidity
using {a as ''} for uint;
```
Tokens like `""` or `hex""` trigger the same problem. Interestingly, others that I would expect to cause this as well do not. `()`, `1`, `x`, `"abc"`, `false` are all handled properly.

I found a very similar problem early in the PR's life where using an identifier like `x` was causing a crash. That was because such tokens have no string representation assigned in `Token.h` (they have `nullptr` instead). That's the case for string literals too so I wonder what's different specifically about empty string literals.
