### Description

GitHub has updated Git protocol security, and the usage of the unencrypted git protocol has been retired permanently on March 15th 2022. But, there are few instances of such in Solidity scripts file for Vcs-Git. Hence, may lead to bunch of unauthenticated git protocol errors.

### Proposed Solution

Use https protocol in place of unencrypted git protocol

`git://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git` should be changed to
`https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git`

Fixes  #14019

Hey @r0qs!

>Did you notice some inconsistency or have an example of such errors?

I was going through the scripts and noticed that under the debian package creation section, it was still mentioned `git:\\` for Z3 theorem prover. I earlier thought that using the `git:\\` protocol in place of `https:\\` will result in bunch of unauthenticated or unencrypted git protocol errors, but looks like it has been totally disabled. 

>Effective from March 15, 2022, The deprecated MACs, ciphers, and unencrypted Git protocol will be permanently disabled.

Hey, thanks for the info. As far as I know, the `Vcs-Git` field is more for documentation purposes of the version control system of the given package. But I guess it may be used for some automation as well, but not really sure. Anyway, if the old link is broken, it is better indeed that we replace it, besides the security concerns of course ;)

Could you please rebase your branch onto the `develop` branch? Also, I think it is fine to squash the two commits into one as well.

My bad, closed wrong PR :)

@krvaibhaw thanks, but we prefer to not have merge commits and use rebase instead, so we keep the commits history clean. Could you please use rebase?

Please take a look at our contribution guidelines for more information: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#workflow-for-pull-requests

@krvaibhaw if you're having trouble with undoing the merge, it would probably be easiest to just close this PR and open another one on top of a fresh develop.

I fixed it for him ;)

Also, @krvaibhaw, next time that you contribute please do it in a separated branch in your fork and do not merge that branch onto your fork's `develop` branch. So we can easily adjusts the code that you are changing in the PR without the need to force push to the main branch in your fork.

Thanks for the fix @r0qs, Sure will do that in future.
