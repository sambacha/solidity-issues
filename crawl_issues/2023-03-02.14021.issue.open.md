#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113422569?u=be5dbba991986feb805ed99c533b943cb8d8cf28&v=4" width="50">[qwaz-theori](https://github.com/qwaz-theori) opened issue at [2023-03-02 05:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14021):

## Description

```solidity
contract Foo {
    struct Hi {
        uint256 hello;
    }

    function foo() internal returns (Hi storage ret) {
        ret = ret;
        ret.hello = 123;
    }
}
```

This code accesses `ret` storage pointer without initializing it. It should not compile, but the Solidity compiler accepts this code.

## Environment

- Compiler version: `Version: 0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.Linux.g++`
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Default setting
- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04

## Steps to Reproduce

Save the above file as `test.sol` and run `solc test.sol`.

Without `ret = ret;` line, the expected warning message is printed:
```

--> test.sol

Warning: Source file does not specify required compiler version! Consider adding "pragma solidity ^0.8.18;"
--> test.sol

Error: This variable is of storage pointer type and can be returned without prior assignment, which would lead to undefined behaviour.
 --> test.sol:6:38:

6 |     function foo() internal returns (Hi storage ret) {
  |                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

Yeah, looks like a bug. The compiler normally would not let you use `ret` in an expression before it is initialized. After the assignment it would stop complaining. Here it's wrongly assuming it has already been assigned when processing the right-hand side.

After discussing it in the team it turns out that it was at least partially intentional. You can suppress a warning about an unused return variable by assigning it to itself - any expression involving the variable on the right-hand side of the assignment will do this. However, this was done way back, before you could assign to storage variables in inline assembly, which would be a better and more explicit way to silence it. The storage case is potentially more dangerous than other cases so we're still going to consider it a bug and disallow it.

Just to clarify: disallowing this right a way would still definitely be breaking. Our conclusion in the end was that we start emitting a warning for this now (which can then be silenced by an assembly assignment), and then turn that into an error in 0.9, right?

Yes.
