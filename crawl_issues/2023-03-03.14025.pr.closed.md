Exactly what @r0qs said - this PR should address the necessary documentation changes completely, and not one by one; the reason for this is that we may release at any time, and I don't want this to be partially fixed for the next release to the point where it requires merging multiple PRs over multiple releases in order to get this done.

Also, some of these documentation changes are trivial (like this one), but some of them are more complex and would require altering certain code examples to exclude `selfdestruct` calls.

This makes sense. It's also extremely sensitive far as safety goes.
