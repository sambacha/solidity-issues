# [\#14029 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14029) `merged`: Use `std::` prefix with `std::forward()` as well to satisfy Clang

Related to #13554.
Also #14001 because I need to compile the code with Clang to reproduce it.

Clang 15.0.7 (Arch Linux) on my machine won't cleanly compile out sources due to warnings about `std::forward`:

```
libsolidity/ast/ASTJsonImporter.cpp:87:3: error: unqualified call to 'std::forward' [-Werror,-Wunqualified-std-cast-call]
                forward<Args>(_args)...
                ^
                std::
libsolidity/ast/ASTJsonImporter.cpp:278:31: note: in instantiation of function template specialization 'solidity::frontend::ASTJsonImporter::createASTNode<solidity::frontend::SourceUnit, std::optional<std::basic_string<char>> &, std::vector<std::shared_ptr<solidity::frontend::ASTNode>> &>' requested here
        ASTPointer<SourceUnit> tmp = createASTNode<SourceUnit>(_node, license, nodes);
```

If we want it to compile, we have to make an exception like we did for `std::move()`.

It's weird that our CI does not catch this though.
