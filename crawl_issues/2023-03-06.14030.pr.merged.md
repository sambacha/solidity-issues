# [\#14030 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14030) `merged`: Fix `b_ubu_ubsan_clang` running the address sanitizer instead of the undefined behavior sanitizer
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Looks like #11896 broke the undefined behavior sanitizer we run in nightly. It made the `ubsan` job run the address sanitizer instead. It's probably the reason why #14001 did not make nightly fail after we merged it.
