This PR updates hardhat to [2.13.0](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/releases/tag/hardhat%402.13.0) in openzeppelin external tests and removes the tests that were already fixed for that version. It also skips the `shouldBehaveLikeAccessControlDefaultAdminRules` tests, which were added by [this](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/commit/dad73159df3d3053c72b5e430fa8164330f18068#diff-8d09643e497bb43f23091ffdc8c3e4b0816a696796c4c5d5009b06f44ad3dca0R17) commit but do not work when using via-ir.

Well, on the one hand, upstream zeppelin neither uses upstream hardhat nor via-IR yet, does it? So they'll have tests that assume non-via-IR behaviour. And also the hardhat release has "basic via-IR support", not "full via-IR support" :-). Or which workarounds do you mean?

I opened a new issue about the remaining problem here https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/3750

I meant all the regexes we still have in the test script. It's not impossible that OZ has something that depends on legacy, but I think it's unlikely. I haven't seen anything like that so far. I suspect that the support is not full yet. My point was that the issues were closed, even though these cases are not fixed. It's fine if they're still working on it, but then I think they should be kept open in that case.

Thanks @r0qs for opening a new one!
