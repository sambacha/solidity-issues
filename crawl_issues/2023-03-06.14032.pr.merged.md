I'm actually not sure if this needs a changelog. It's a bug, but does not cause a crash that the user would see or any ill effects. At least none that I could observe. It's only detected by the sanitizer.

What would we write as an entry for this? What was the bug that got fixed?
Although the null derefence is wrong, its use was avoided in the original code, so it was harmless. Maybe, it would be confusing to users, especially beginners.
