I was not sure if I should include the secondary location here if possible, i.e, in case the erroneous suffix is indeed a function and not something else which doesn't have a declaration.

I think it would be useful. The message does not even say what that thing you tried to use as a suffix really is so I think it's a good idea to show it.

@cameel, I was trying to implement that but got stuck on the problem of having the same error id appearing 2 times (which is enforced by our script `error_codes.py`):

```c++
string functionErrorMessage = "The literal suffix must be either a subdenomination or a file-level suffix function.";
if (
    suffixFunctionType &&
    suffixFunctionType->hasDeclaration() &&
    dynamic_cast<FunctionDefinition const*>(&suffixFunctionType->declaration())
)
    m_errorReporter.typeError(
        4438_error,
        _literal.location(),
        SecondarySourceLocation().append(
            "Function defined here:",
            dynamic_cast<FunctionDefinition const*>(&suffixFunctionType->declaration())->location()
        ),
        functionErrorMessage
    );
else
    m_errorReporter.typeError(4438_error, _literal.location(), functionErrorMessage);
```

Maybe adding a new method to `ErrorReporter` which has an `optional` `SecondaryLocation`?

You could make it optional in the current methods. But maybe it's not even necessary. Have you checked what happens if you pass in an empty `SecondarySourceLocation()` without appending anything to it?

By the way, in the `dynamic_cast<FunctionDefinition const*>(&suffixFunctionType->declaration())` case you still have something to point at (it's just not a function definition) so I would not exclude it.

Ah, hadn't thought about that. Yes, that works and it's better solution.

Ok, I will include that case.

Thanks!
