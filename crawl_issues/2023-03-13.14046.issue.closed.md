# [\#14046 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14046) `closed`: Usage of `bytes(uint)` is ambiguous

## Description

Usage of `bytes(uint)` conversion is ambiguous. 

Here is a demonstration of usage - running a simple foundry test.

You can see, it seems like it produces empty bytes, but when it is hashed (`keccak256`) the output is different, meaning there is something else under the hood.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "forge-std/console.sol";

contract FooBar {
   
    function debugBytesConversion() public {
        address dummyCanonicalTokenAddress = address(this);
        uint256 chainId = 1;
        uint256 chainId2 = 2;

        bytes memory concatenation =
                bytes.concat(
                    bytes32(chainId)
        );

        console.log("Output with chain ID 1 if not keccak hashed:");
        console.log(string(abi.encodePacked(concatenation)));

        bytes memory concatenation2 =
                bytes.concat(
                    bytes32(chainId2)
                );

        console.log("Output with chain ID 2 if not keccak hashed:");
        console.log(string(abi.encodePacked(concatenation2)));


        console.log("Output with chain ID 1 if keccak hashed:");
        console.log(string(abi.encodePacked(keccak256(concatenation))));


        console.log("Output with chain ID 2 if keccak hashed:");
        console.log(string(abi.encodePacked(keccak256(concatenation2))));
    }
}

contract EmptyBytesTest is Test {
    FooBar foobar;

    function setUp() public {
        foobar = new FooBar();
    }

    function testBytes() external {
        foobar.debugBytesConversion();
    } 
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.18 but tried with different.
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry for example - but issue visible if i write tests in Hardhat.
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Testing env.
- Operating system: MacOsX

## Steps to Reproduce

See source code above.

Hi @adaki2004 and thanks for the report. Do you mind posting the actual output of all of the `console.log` calls?

@adaki2004 what happens if you do the following:
```solidity
console.logBytes(concatenation);
// or
console.logBytes(abi.encodePacked(hex"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"));
```
It seems more an issue with the foundry `console.log` than a compiler issue.

Thanks @r0qs ! Will check in a minute but you can see my main problem below.
We wanted to optimize things, and meant to be the same, but it turns out it breaks our hardhat tests (obviously not the foundry ones, bc. they will pass), so this is why i'm asking.

```
key = string.concat(Strings.toString(chainId), ".", name);
// Line below is cheaper in gas but will break Hardhat tests
// key = string(bytes.concat(bytes32(chainId), bytes(name)));
```

Seems like the `bytes.concat` or the `bytes(uint)` is messing with me.. :) Any recommendations ? @nikola-matic  @r0qs

Right. The problem is that not all ascii characters are printable, so you are getting the correct output as far as I'm concerned. For instance, if you do:

```solidity
console.log(string(abi.encodePacked(hex"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061")));
```
You should get `a` as output.
 
> ```
> key = string.concat(Strings.toString(chainId), ".", name);
> // Line below is cheaper in gas but will break Hardhat tests
> // key = string(bytes.concat(bytes32(chainId), bytes(name)));
> ```

Not really sure of what you want achieve here, but if you want to define some sort of unique identifier based on the `name` and `chainId`, you could just use it as bytes instead of string, no? E.g.: 

```solidity
console.logBytes32(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(chainId, name)));
```

Yes, so what we are trying to do is to keep track of a mapping between a `key` (this is the key creation i copied above) and an address.
So for example on chain 1, bank contract is a 
`1.bank = 0x120189D......ABC`

So the string of `1.bank` is our key and important to use it kinda this way, because we reference it on several places in the contract or in the tests , clients, etc., also readability point of view it is.
On the other hand we wanted to optimze for gas..

hum...a bit tricky to focus on gas optimization while keeping readability, often this is not really the case. And honestly, I'd rather use a hash as a key.

But yeah, design discussions around this is out of scope of the issue. I'd suggest that you post your design questions in our [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/), or our [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im) or even [Ethereum stack exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/), and we can continue discussions from there.

I'm closing this since it is not a compiler issue ;)
