# [\#14049 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14049) `closed`: The assignment of `immutable variables` in the `constructor` is affected by the subsequent `bytecode`

## Description

The assignment of `Immutable Variable` in the `constructor` function may be incorrectly assigned under the influence of subsequent inline assembly code (for example `msotre`).

## Environment

- Compiler version:
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): <=0.8.19
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: EVM execution environment 
- Operating system: Windows

## Steps to Reproduce
###
The expected behavior of the following code is that `a` is `0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571`, but is eventually assigned the value `msg.sender`.
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;
contract C {
    address public immutable a;
    constructor() public {
        a = 0x4B20993Bc481177ec7E8f571ceCaE8A9e22C02db;
        F(msg.sender);
    }
    function F(address witnessAddress) view public returns(address){
        assembly{
            mstore(0x80,witnessAddress)
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

### Reasons

The reason for the above problem is that, unlike other source code compilation results, the assignment of an `immutable -variable` is first `mstore` in the `memory` area starting at `0x80`, and then `mload` is used to save the variable to the `stack` area after the `constructor`â€™s user code is executed, and `mstore` is executed again after `codecopy` to modify the `bytecode` content.
This means that the code after the `immutable-variable` assignment may still affect its execution logic. For example, `mstore.`


### Impact

Through the collection of open-source [projects](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+lang:solidity+mstore%280x80+count:all&patternType=standard&sm=0&groupBy=repo), we can easily find a large number of functions that use the `mstore` operation.
For example, [the following code snippet](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/thec00n/etherscan_verified_contracts/-/blob/contracts/0xec424a2a841a6c77d270fd91bd885ccb06392be5_Admin.sol)
```solidity
function initialize() internal view {
       ...
        assembly {
            ...
            mstore(0x80, sload(0))
```
This means that mstore operations are common, and we need to be wary of such operations being called in `constructors` that have `immutable variables`.

### Fix

We suggest giving some `warning` about the above problem in the compilation result to warning users of the above risk.
