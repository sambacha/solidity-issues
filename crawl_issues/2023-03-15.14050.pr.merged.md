Apart from the comments above, this is mostly ready I think and mainly missing a changelog entry.

We can also try and draw @haltman-at's attention to the binaries in this PR, resp. to the AST in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/96dee72fe5b5fb6e68fbe25cdf00c3470a2ce794/test/libsolidity/ASTJSON/ast_internal_function_id_export.json (and the ``internalFunctionID`` fields in that) to confirm that this is a good enough fix for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13425 for the needs of the Truffle debugger.

@haltman-at we would love to hear your comments on this before merging. If the PR indeed fixes the issue for your use case.

I think this *should* solve the issue, so I'm merging this.

(FWIW, I was on sabbatical for a few weeks and so didn't have a chance to test this out, but I'll assume you all know what you're doing. :)  Will still try to test it before release still if I have a chance I guess...)
