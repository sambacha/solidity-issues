- Update the example metadata JSON to follow the alphabetically ordered canonical format. Also add the `"errors"` field in `devdoc` and `userdoc`.

- Shorten the CBOR encoding part and add a link to https://playground.sourcify.dev
  - I think this is demonstrated better in action.
  - Also the previous docs were both giving the example of `0xa264` as well as mentioning multiple times not to use this pattern. It's better to not mention this pattern at all and to explain the correct way to decode.
- Update the explanation for the Source Code Verification section

Added "appends to **runtime** bytecode" explicitly as it is not necessarily found at the end of the creation bytecode.

I find it useful to break down the contents of the metadata when explaining into two:
- How to interact with the contract: ABI, and NatSpec documentation.
- How to reproduce the compilation and verify a deployed contract:
  compiler version, compiler settings, and source files used.

Changed the first paragraph to this to quickly give an overview of the **purpose** of the file as well as its **contents**

> Squash the commits please.

Sorry I thought this was meant for the person merging to click "Squash and merge" in the PR. Do I need to squash, i.e. rebase and force-push everything into one commit?

Yes, but now that you mention it, let me check how the `Squash and merge` feature works here before you do anything. :D

@kuzdogan yeah, it seems like it's a configurable feature, and I have no idea how we have it configured, so please rebase, squash into one commit, and force push, and I'll merge it.
