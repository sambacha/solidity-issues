Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13943

We're doing a few things here regarding the default values for the model checker settings:

- Timeout has a default value of 1 second now. The SMTCheckerTests still need to use the old rlimit for reproducibility, which is done by overriding the timeout value in the settings
- Only assertions are checked by default. The others need to be enabled explicitly, as already was the case for overflow and underflow.
- If Eldarica is the chosen solver and the user has not explicitly set a value for `divModNoSlacks` we automatically make it `true` because that works better for Eldarica.
