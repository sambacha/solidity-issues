AFAIU, whitespaces are ignored in the lexer and then values like the one below (from a failing test) are parsed by `antlr` with no errors:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/ce63256c113fd88f185d65f76eaa45b683ecfb42/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/literalSuffixes/application/invalid_suffix_no_whitespace.sol#L4

The same already happened before for `denominations`, but we don't seem to have any tests for this case. The following will also be parsed successfully by `antlr`:
```solidity
contract C {
 uint x = 1000gwei;
}
```

I see we have a `WS` token that represents whitespace. Try putting it before identifier and see if that makes ANTLR require whitespace there.

Also, please add a syntax test for each of the whitespace characters that is allowed there - mine only has the space.

> The same already happened before for `denominations`, but we don't seem to have any tests for this case.

Good find. We should also do the same for subdenominations: fix the grammar and add syntax tests.

I tried it but doesn't work.
In the previous message, I should have explained better that the `WS` token defined in the lexer recognizes whitespaces and then discards them using the `skip` [command](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/lexer-rules.md#skip). So, when the parser gets the tokens, none of them are `WS` and thus it never chooses `suffixedLiteral`  or `numberLiteralWithSubdenomination` rules.

I also found a problem with the `functionDefinition` rule. Since it can recognize multiple `modifierInvocation` and `suffix` is not a language keyword, the `antlr` parser will fail to error out a function with repeated `suffix` specifiers:
```solidity
function suffix1(uint) pure suffix suffix returns (uint) {}
// ----
// ParserError 2878: (82-88): Suffix already specified.
```

Hmm... Indeed looks like a problem. Actually, why `virtual` and `override` do not cause similar problems? The current grammar allows them on free function definitions. Do we just have no syntax test that tries to put `virtual` on a free function?

But anyway, one way out would be to split `functionDefinition` into `freeFunctionDefinition` and `contractFunctionDefinition`. It actually would not be that bad because it would make the grammar more precise and `freeFunctionDefinition` would be quite simple because it does not allow a lot of stuff that's allowed in contract functions.

Another one would be to allow only either `modifierInvocation` or `Suffix`. But I suspect that the only nice way to achieve that in ANTLR may be the split I mentioned above.

> I tried it but doesn't work.

ok, so here's another idea. Looks like our scanner actually properly parses `1000suffix` as a number followed by a literal and just has an extra validation that rejects it: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2ca349c69aefe8c7033764f2e49c91fe99ccaed5/liblangutil/Scanner.cpp#L1004-L1009

We could simulate this by recognizing a number followed by literal as its own thing. Try to define `DecimalNumberFollowedByIdentifier`, which can basically consists of chars allowed in `DecimalNumber`, and then chars allowed in identifier. Just defining such a rule should make ANTLR recognize that `1000suffix` is not a decimal number.

Also, to make sure it works, please add test cases for hex and fractional numbers (I suspect you'll need separate rules to handle them): `0x1000suffix`, `1000.0suffix` `1000.0e-5suffix` and `0x1000abcdefgh`.

Also, these grammar changes (i.e. split into free/contract function, number+identifier, renaming of `NumberUnit`) are quite general and do not depend on suffixes. Once you get them to pass all tests, I'd suggest to move them (along with relevant test cases) to another PR, straight to `develop` and here leave only changes that introduce `suffix`. We can get them merged separately and keep the main suffix PR smaller that way.

We do have tests for that, but they generate `SyntaxError` rather than `ParserError`, which is the only category `test_antlr_grammar.sh` looks for in order to detect divergence with `solc` parser.
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2ca349c69aefe8c7033764f2e49c91fe99ccaed5/scripts/test_antlr_grammar.sh#L83-L88

Ok, agreed.

Interesting. Well, then maybe working around it `test_antlr_grammar.sh` in some way would not be out of the question if adjusting it turns out to be too complicated. But first let's try to do it the nice way. We should be able to match the grammar.

I checked the `test_antlr_grammar` script and found out that tests that are multi-source files like the one I mentioned before are excluded before actually running the `ANTLR` parser.
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/65188cafc3a277c0dfa74fb09c17e16f99f19d31/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/literalSuffixes/usableAsSuffix/imported_function_as_suffix.sol#L1-L5

Still, seems like the parser accepts member access as literal suffixes...

You mean ANTLR or solc parser? Because the latter obviously does, but ANTLR should too.

In any case, this explains why it did not fail. This means that the grammar is really incomplete, we just can't properly test it. It needs to be updated to cover this case.

I meant `ANTLR` parser. I just removed the `==== Source ...  ` separators from the file and then let the script apply the `ANTLR` parser on it, which reported success.

Are we going to do this in the context of the literal suffix PR or is it a task we leave for later?

In this PR. Without it the grammar is incomplete.

This sounds weird. Is it only for suffixes or does it let you use dotted paths in other places that grammar does not officially include?

I checked with the `ANTLR` test tool using the options `-tokens` and `-gui` (manually typing in CLI). When parsing expression `uint x = 1 A.b.c;` it produces the following output:

```
[@0,0:3='uint',<UnsignedIntegerType>,1:0]
[@1,5:12='constant',<'constant'>,1:5]
[@2,14:14='x',<Identifier>,1:14]
[@3,16:16='=',<'='>,1:16]
[@4,18:18='1',<DecimalNumber>,1:18]
[@5,20:20='A',<Identifier>,1:20]
[@6,21:21='.',<Period>,1:21]
[@7,22:22='b',<Identifier>,1:22]
[@8,23:23='.',<Period>,1:23]
[@9,24:24='c',<Identifier>,1:24]
[@10,25:25=';',<Semicolon>,1:25]
[@11,27:26='<EOF>',<EOF>,2:0]

``` 

The visualization tool produces this tree:
![antlr4_parse_tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95899911/229646306-7f648cfd-833b-4b74-80dd-b47a2386fa30.png)


It first recognizes the value of the assignment as a member access, and then decomposes the `expression` before the `.` as either another member access or finally as a `suffixedLiteral`.

I am trying to find if there's other cases.

Oh, that's very helpful. I see what's happening there.

Basically, ANTLR sees it as if it was `uint x = (1 A).b.c;`, which is already a valid expression. solc parser on the other hand interprets it as `uint x = 1 (A.b.c);`. We do need an extra rule to get that second interpretation.
