# [\#14060 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14060) `closed`: Solc 0.8.18: Added optimization rule `and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z))` => `shl(X, and(Y, Z))`

This is either a documentation issue or a real bug.

I have not verified this is a bug, only read it in the release notes of solc 0.8.18.

So it is possibly just a documentation issue (either incorrect documentation or my incorrect understanding of it).

Yet, I wanted to point that to your immediate attention:

A quick check reveals that for `X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1`:
- The LHS `and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z))` evaluates to `0`
- The RHS `shl(X, and(Y, Z))` evaluates to `1`

with ``X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1``, it holds that
```
and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z)) =
and(shl(1, 0), shl(1, 1)) =
and(0, 2) = 0

shl(X, and(Y, Z)) =
shl(1, and(0, 1)) =
shl(1, 0) = 0
```

Note that the argument order for shifts is (not our fault, it's like that on the EVM level) ``shl(shiftAmount, value)``.

We do have SMT-based formal proofs about the correctness of these rules, so they're not likely to be incorrect. But to me this doesn't look like a bug in the documentation/changelog either, but rather a misunderstanding about the arguments of the opcodes.

Hence I'm closing this issue, but feel free to reopen, if you think this is an issue after all!
