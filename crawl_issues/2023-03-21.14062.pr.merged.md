Looks like we never had newlines in the splitted source files.

This script is used in `test/stopAfterParseTests.sh` and `scripts/ASTImportTest.sh`. It's main purpose is to split some of our test-files into multiple files. E.g. these test-files can be found here: [`test/libsolidity/semanticTests/multiSource`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/libsolidity/semanticTests/multiSource). 

You can run this script locally by just running e.g. `scripts/splitSources.py test/libsolidity/semanticTests/multiSource/free_different_interger_types.sol`.

In this case we see two files that got splitted out from that multi-source test-file: `s1.sol` & `s2.sol`.

If you then just look at the content, you will see that there are no new-lines in this file.

```
$ cat s1.sol
function f(uint24) pure returns (uint) { return 24; }function g(bool) pure returns (bool) { return true; }
```

However, everything is working fine so far - by accident :P It is just working because we have only the comments at the end of the test-files.

E.g. if someone is adding a line comment (anywhere except at the end) within a multi-source test, it will create problems:

```
==== Source: s1.sol ====
// this is an awesome function
function f(uint24) pure returns (uint) { return 24; }
function g(bool) pure returns (bool) { return true; }
==== Source: s2.sol ====
import {f as g, g as g} from "s1.sol";
contract C {
  function foo() public pure returns (uint, bool) {
    return (g(2), g(false));
  }
}
// ====
// compileToEwasm: also
// ----
// foo() -> 24, true
```

Will then lead to:
```
$ cat s1.sol
// this is an awesome functionfunction f(uint24) pure returns (uint) { return 24; }function g(bool) pure returns (bool) { return true; }
```

Where the whole source code just becomes a single comment. I think we don't want to have this.
