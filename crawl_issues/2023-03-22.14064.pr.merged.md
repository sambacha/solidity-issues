# [\#14064 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14064) `merged`: External tests script refactor

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2023-03-22 12:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14064):

Extracted from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13873#discussion_r1073469133.
The script allows running external tests by name (e.g. one, multiple or all external tests) and automatically detects their configuration scritps. I prefered to detect the configuration scripts automatically instead of hardcode the available external tests, to allow us to add/remove new tests without the need to modify the runner script.

The idea is that this script will be used as part of PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13873 to run the external tests locally or via CI.
