While working in [literal suffixes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14054), some problematic cases not covered by tests were found and [motivated](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14054#issuecomment-1477958615) this.

I was not sure if the changes should go in their own section titled `Antlr Changes`.

By the way, just FYI, you don't have to squash it into a single commit. In this case it would be even nicer to have the independent changes in separate commits. There should just be no commits that change things from other commits from the same PR. Other than that it mostly matters that each commit is a single logical change.

A good rule is that if it's hard to describe the set of changes in one short sentence, it's probably doing more than one thing and could be split.

Good to know that. I'll keep in mind for the future. Thanks.
Should we leave this in a single commit or try to restore the order from before?

Let's leave it as is so that we can merge it :)
