# [\#14069 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14069) `closed`: Optimizer low runs value doubles gas cost of function

## Description

I'm not sure if this is a bug, or extreme edge behavior of the optimizer so I'm seeking advice here. I have a hash function implemented [here](https://github.com/vimwitch/hhbug/blob/main/contracts/PoseidonT3.sol#L37). With low runs the cost of executing is roughly doubled. For example, the cost of an `addmod` operation goes from 22 gas to 52 gas (including assigment to stack).

I understand that low runs indicates to optimize for deployment cost instead of call cost, but is increasing the call cost this much expected behavior? It's not a huge problem because the library will deployed at a global location with the runs value set to 2**32-1, but it may confuse developers that consume the hash function as a package in a development environment.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.7.4, 0.8.4, 0.8.17
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Merge
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix, Hardhat
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: hardhat/remix vm
- Operating system: OSX

## Steps to Reproduce

I have a repository [here](https://github.com/vimwitch/hhbug) reproducing the behavior. Specifically disabling the optimizer cuts the cost of executing the function by 2x (same with increasing runs to 2**32-1).

If you clone this repo run

```
npm i
npm t
```

and it will print info about costs. Change the `hardhat.config.js` file to disable the optimizer and run again and you'll see a different output.

Thanks

@vimwitch I think this is more of a question/discussion for the language [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/). As you noted
> [...] low runs indicates to optimize for deployment cost instead of call cost [...]

Your repo uses `200` for the `runs` parameter, which is **very** low and thus, in my opinion, would justify the optimizer not caring about the `addmod` cost. 
For example, if you use a value of `2**13` for the `runs` parameter, then the cost goes to `22`.
I am closing this for now, but, please feel free to reply if you think this really is an issue.
