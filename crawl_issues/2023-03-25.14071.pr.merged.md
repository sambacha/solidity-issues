- Change `first` -> `second`. `PUSH1 3 PUSH1 0x80 MLOAD ADD PUSH1 0x80 MSTORE` corresponds to the second line, not the first line.
- Clarify the description of `log0` data. It's clear from the instruction arguments that that's not true, but the description `log without topics and data mem[p...(p+s))` could be taken not to include `data`.
- Unify to `e.g.`
