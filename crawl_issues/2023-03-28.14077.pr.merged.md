```diff
 For example, you could run the following command in your ``build`` folder:
+
 .. code-block:: bash
```

#### Wrap numbers in backquotes

```diff
-  - Old code generator: 3 (``1 + 2``) but the return value is unspecified in general
-  - New code generator: 4 (``2 + 2``) but the return value is not guaranteed
+  - Old code generator: ``3`` (``1 + 2``) but the return value is unspecified in general

#### Fix unnecessary capitalization

#### Consolidate languages into formal names
- python -> Python
- Javascript -> JavaScript
- solidity -> Solidity

#### Use the function name

```diff
-Send is the low-level counterpart of ``transfer``. If the execution fails, the current contract will not stop with an exception, but ``send`` will return ``false``.
