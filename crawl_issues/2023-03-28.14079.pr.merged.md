docs/security-considerations.rst:7:While it is usually quite easy to build software that works as expected, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:10:In Solidity, this is even more important because you can use smart contracts to handle tokens or, possibly, even more valuable things. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:14:You can compare a smart contract with a web service that is open to the public 
docs/security-considerations.rst:16:If you only store your grocery list on that web service, you might not have to take too much care, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:19:This section will list some pitfalls and general security recommendations but can, of course, never be complete.  
docs/security-considerations.rst:20:Also, keep in mind that even if your smart contract code is bug-free, the compiler or the platform itself might have a bug. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:21:A list of some publicly known security-relevant bugs of the compiler can be found in the :ref:`list of known bugs<known_bugs>`, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:22:which is also machine-readable. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:25:As always, with open-source documentation, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:46:Any interaction from a contract (A) with another contract (B) and any transfer of Ether hands over control to that contract (B). 
docs/security-considerations.rst:47:This makes it possible for B to call back into A before this interaction is completed. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:66:The problem is not too serious here because of the limited gas as part of ``send``, but it still exposes a weakness: 
docs/security-considerations.rst:67:Ether transfer can always include code execution, so the recipient could be a contract that calls back into ``withdraw``. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:68:This would let it get multiple refunds and basically, retrieve all the Ether in the contract. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:69:In particular, the following contract will allow an attacker to refund multiple times as it uses ``call`` 
docs/security-considerations.rst:107:The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern ensures that all code paths through a contract 
docs/security-considerations.rst:108:complete all required checks of the supplied parameters before modifying the contract's state (Checks); 
docs/security-considerations.rst:109:only then it makes any changes to the state (Effects); 
docs/security-considerations.rst:111:storage (Interactions). This is a common foolproof way to prevent *reentrancy attacks*, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:112:where an externally called malicious contract can double-spend an allowance, double-withdraw a balance, among other things, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:115:Note that reentrancy is not only an effect of Ether transfer but of any function call on another contract. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:116:Furthermore, you also have to take multi-contract situations into account. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:123:Due to the block gas limit, transactions can only consume a certain amount of gas. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:124:Either explicitly or just due to normal operation, the number of iterations in a loop can grow beyond the block gas limit 
docs/security-considerations.rst:125:which can cause the complete contract to be stalled at a certain point. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:126:This may not apply to ``view`` functions that are only executed to read data from the blockchain. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:127:Still, such functions may be called by other contracts as part of on-chain operations and stall those. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:134:  Contracts can react on and reject a regular transfer, but there are ways to move Ether without creating a message call. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:139:  If it does not have a ``receive`` nor a ``fallback`` function, the Ether will be rejected (by throwing an exception). 
docs/security-considerations.rst:140:  During the execution of one of these functions, the contract can only rely on the "gas stipend" it is passed (2300 gas) 
docs/security-considerations.rst:141:  being available to it at that time. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:142:  This stipend is not enough to modify storage (do not take this for granted though, the stipend might change with future hard forks). 
docs/security-considerations.rst:143:  To be sure that your contract can receive Ether in that way, check the gas requirements of the receive and fallback functions 
docs/security-considerations.rst:146:- There is a way to forward more gas to the receiving contract using ``addr.call{value: x}("")``. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:147:  This is essentially the same as ``addr.transfer(x)``, only that it forwards all remaining gas 
docs/security-considerations.rst:148:  and opens up the ability for the recipient to perform more expensive actions 
docs/security-considerations.rst:149:  (and it returns a failure code instead of automatically propagating the error). 
docs/security-considerations.rst:177:External function calls can fail at any time because they exceed the maximum call stack size limit of 1024. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:179:Malicious actors might be able to force the call stack to a high value before they interact with your contract. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:182:Note that ``.send()`` does **not** throw an exception if the call stack is depleted but rather returns ``false`` in that case. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:188:If your contract can act as a proxy, i.e. if it can call arbitrary contracts with user-supplied data, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:189:then the user can essentially assume the identity of the proxy contract. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:190:Even if you have other protective measures in place, it is best to build your contract system such 
docs/security-considerations.rst:191:that the proxy does not have any permissions (not even for itself). 
docs/security-considerations.rst:220:Never use ``tx.origin`` for authorization. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:264:If your wallet had checked ``msg.sender`` for authorization, it would get the address of the attack wallet, instead of the owner's address. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:265:But by checking ``tx.origin``, it gets the original address that kicked off the transaction, which is still the owner's address. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:306:The Solidity type ``mapping`` (see :ref:`mapping-types`) is a storage-only key-value data structure 
docs/security-considerations.rst:307:that does not keep track of the keys that were assigned a non-zero value.  
docs/security-considerations.rst:309:If a ``mapping`` is used as the base type of a dynamic storage array, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:311:The same happens, for example, if a ``mapping`` is used as the type of a member field of a ``struct`` 
docs/security-considerations.rst:343:If we call ``eraseMaps``, the length of the state variable ``array`` is zeroed, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:345:After deleting ``array``, calling ``allocate(5)`` allows us to access ``array[4]`` again, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:357:  You can craft transactions that call a function ``f(uint8 x)`` with a raw byte argument of ``0xff000001`` and with ``0x00000001``. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:358:  Both are fed to the contract and both will look like the number ``1`` as far as ``x`` is concerned, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:379:Restrict the amount of Ether (or other tokens) that can be stored in a smart contract. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:380:If your source code, the compiler or the platform has a bug, these funds may be lost. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:386:Keep your contracts small and easily understandable. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:387:Single out unrelated functionality in other contracts or into libraries. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:388:General recommendations about the source code quality of course apply: 
docs/security-considerations.rst:389:Limit the amount of local variables, the length of functions and so on. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:398:As the second step, if all checks passed, effects to the state variables of the current contract should be made. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:401:Early contracts delayed some effects and waited for external function calls to return in a non-error state. 
docs/security-considerations.rst:413:You can add a function in your smart contract that performs some self-checks like "Has any Ether leaked?", 
docs/security-considerations.rst:417:If the self-check fails, the contract automatically switches into some kind of "failsafe" mode, 
docs/security-considerations.rst:418:which, for example, disables most of the features, hands over control to a fixed and trusted third party 
docs/security-considerations.rst:425:Asking people to review your code also helps as a cross-check to find out whether your code is easy to understand - 

```
