## Abstract
> **NOTE: This seems to only be breaking if you do another external call from a contract with address(0). e.g. in the example below, if callA returns address(0).**

`try/catch` only catches the very first external call although it allows multiple external calls to be tried. This could be a bit of a footgun if a single external call is not warned or enforced or if each of the external calls in the "try" block are not tried.

## Motivation

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->
This can be slightly confusing when you do something like: `try IContractB(contractA.callA()).callB() {} catch {}`
This will revert if the function `callB` doesn't exist on the address returned by `contractA.callA`.

The interfaces:
```
IContractA {
  function callA() external returns (address);
}

IContractB {
  function callB() external;
}
```


## Specification

It would make more sense to:
1. not allow multiple external calls to be tried (compiler error)
2. try each of them separately
3. warn that you have multiple external calls in a try "block" (compiler warning)

## Backwards Compatibility

Specifications 2 and 3 would likely be backwards compatible, but Specification 1 would probably break code which violates this rule when they update their solc if this change was made.
