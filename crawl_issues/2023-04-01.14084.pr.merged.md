With the reference to the issue: #12934 and it's task number 3 i.e.

- [x] Members of address, type, etc. should be in a separate section, not under "Global Variables".

I have segregated the code snippets with reference to the Solidity docs.

Note that the `chk_coding_style` job is failing. I think you have some extra trailing whitespace there. Please configure your editor to remove trailing whitespace when you save.

My pr is using patch-3 so it might not be the problem merging I guess

Wait, why? It's perfectly fine to just rebase this one.

We rebase PRs all the time. Creating a new one each time you do that would be pretty spammy :)

Oh Okay, so I searched about rebasing PR, Is this like changing my pr from patch-3 to develop ? Rebasing is kind of new to me ðŸ˜…

Oh yeah okay I got it. So, instead of directly merging into develop branch which is the main branch, we shall upload it into another branch which may be gradually be merged into the main branch. So, which branch shall I merge into ?

Rebasing is taking just the commits you did on top of a branch (the old state of `develop` in this case) and copying them on top of another branch (the new state of `develop`).

Make sure `develop` is up to date with remote repo, check out your branch, and run `git rebase develop --interactive` (make sure the `$EDITOR` variable in the shell points to an editor you're comfortable with). git will open the editor and show you a list of commits it will copy. If the list is ok, you just close the editor and it will perform the operation. It will also remove any merge commits you have in there, which is what we want. If it succeeds, you can do `git push origin <your branch> --force-with-lease` to update the PR.

It may turn out that the file you were working on top of was changed. Then git will stop in the middle and ask you to resolve the conflict (which is just like resolving merge conflicts, but for a single commit). Once you do that you continue with `git rebase --continue` until there are no more conflicts. If you do something wrong with conflict resolution you can always do `git rebase --abort` and return to the clean state you had before you started rebasing.

I recommend creating a backup branch pointing at the spot where your branch is right now (check it out and do `git branch <backup branch>`). Then, if you end up getting the rebase wrong, you can always go back to the original state with
```bash
git checkout <backup branch>
git checkout -B <your branch>
```

No, it's exactly the opposite. Gradual merging is what you did here (just in the other direction - from `develop` into your branch) and we do not normally do that. Instead we rebase the branch on top of `develop` and merge it into it in one go.

This way there are no invisible changes in history coming from conflict resolutions inside merge commits. Every conflict resolution is done explicitly as a part of one of your commits.

@ojasaklechayt the commits could be cleaned a bit, especially the `Merge Branch` ones.
I would like to kindly recommend this as a resource for better understanding of `git`: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
It was very helpful to me when I started working with the `tool` and made everything much clearer.

Unfortunately it isn't. After a rebase you should get a simple, linear, easy to understand history. Whatever you ended up with... was not it :) In general, if you see any commits named `Merge branch ... into ...`, it's not properly rebased.

Anyway, I rebased the branch for you and fixed the small issues I just pointed out. I'm going to merge it now. Thanks for contribution!

Thankyou so much for the support @cameel. I learned a lot with this pr.
