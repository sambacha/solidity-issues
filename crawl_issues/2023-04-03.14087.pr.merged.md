# [\#14087 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14087) `merged`: Better error message when trying to call things that are not functions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-04-03 14:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14087):

This is a little annoyance I noticed when working on #12656. When you try to use something weird, like a module or a modifier, as a suffix, you get a confusing message telling you it's a type: `Type is not callable`. This happens for normal function call syntax so I'm submitting a separate PR to fix it.
