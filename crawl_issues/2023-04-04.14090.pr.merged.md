As the matrix API currently [does not support markdown](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#mtext), the CI notification bot was posting unformatted text to the `solidity-dev` channel, as can be seen [here](https://matrix.to/#/!poXqlbVpQfXKWGseLY:gitter.im/$wa5nqCiWQXFCQboYHpQv_ivgqDwB7crJ55ne3z6Q6lg?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.dapp.org.uk).

This PR adds support to text formatting using the `org.matrix.custom.html` format. It also splits the notification logic from the CI config, allowing us to easily adapt the script to fix https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13507 as well.

@r0qs I just noticed this error in one of my CI runs (this one does not have an associated PR yet): https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29302/workflows/29eb5534-683c-454f-98cf-c0cc004beb25/jobs/1301024

```
scripts/ci/notification/matrix_notification.sh: line 75: CIRCLE_TAG: unbound variable
```

This is probably due to `set -u` and basically works as expected - this variable is not always present, so you should use something like `"${CIRCLE_TAG:-}"` to provide an explicit empty default value when accessing it.
