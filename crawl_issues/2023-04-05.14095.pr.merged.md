For the record and for future reference: we *don't* have to resort the Changelog over and over like this... what I did say is that we should not *actively insert Changelog messages in the wrong order*. If it happens that they're out of order during non-rebased merges (or just by mistake), that's fine and can be fixed before the release. In that case git history is f**ed anyways, so doing it in multiple separate PRs is not exactly productive.

Sure thing - I generally pay attention to this a lot more now than before, but this one slipped through a while ago in an older PR.

Yeah, my point is: it's not like this is extremely important, so if a few cases slip through (which is almost unavoidable sometimes), we can just leave it - as long as we're at least low-key *trying* to keep it sorted, all is fine :-).
