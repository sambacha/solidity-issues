What about being more restrictive with our shell-scripts?

I think that those newly detected style problems will help us a lot reviewing shell-scripts. At least some of those reminded me on feedback that @cameel gave me on some of my scripts in the past.

> It finds a few instances of using `[]` instead of `[[]]`, which is nice. Maybe we could enable only this as an individual check (instead of enabling `all`).

If we want to exclude just a small number of checks we could use the `--exclude` flag. Like: `shellcheck --enable all --exclude SC2250 script.sh`.

I believe we will want to have most of the checks enabled, so for me it does make sense to enable all and just exclude the ones that we don't particularly agree with.

Ok, enabling `all` with some more tedious checks disabled sounds fine.

In any case, right now I'd not really enable any check that will be too tedious to fix. We need to cut down on distractions. My suggestion would be to try disabling the two problematic checks I mentioned and see if that yields a more reasonable number of cases to fix. If that's quick to review, it can go in.

The truth is that I really prefer the explicit `${..}` notation for variables (for me it increases the readability - and it is especially easier to write). From my point of view there is no additional value in having rules when we should put the braces and when not - I already forgot the rules you prefer. To just put them always is the simplest rule.

The rule I suggested was simple: skip braces in exactly one but very, very common case where there's no risk of ambiguities: `"${x}"` -> `"$x"`. Keep them in all other cases. There's a reason shellcheck does not enforce braces by default. Not everyone finds those braced vars readable.

In any case, I'm not hell-bent on that rule, we could switch to using braces without exceptions if other people on the team also love them that much. I'm just not looking forward to applying these changes or reviewing that myself :)

@aarlt I think we can just apply the suggestions of this comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14097#discussion_r1159449071 adding the `--exclude SC2250` for now. And we can discuss in the next meeting if we want to move to a different style. I'm fine in keeping in the way it is, i.e. just exclude rule `SC2250` from the checks for now and use braces around variables only where it is really needed.

Executive decision: let's dial it down on styling our scripts rather than dialing it up :-D.
