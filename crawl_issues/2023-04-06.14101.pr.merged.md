- Fixed the missing backticks in 080-breaking-changes, ir-breaking-changes, yul
- Removed the `latexpdfja` command in makefiles. `latexpdfja` is the command for Japanese, but this seems to have not been used since added in #282. It's also broken and causes an error when run, (As a maintainer of the Japanese translation, this is unnecessary.)
- Removed the unnecessary whitespaces in directives and the header of the optimizer step
- Fixed the missing help message of `latexpdf` in make.bat

@NunoFilipeSantos If you remove it, the Dataflow Analyzer, Conditional Simplifier, etc., would also need to be changed.

No, that can be done later in another PR.
Right now since we're changing here, this section is closed.

Indeed it is, thank you! The name formats of the optimizer steps are not entirely consistent on this page, so it may be good that they are consistent someday (but this is a nit).
