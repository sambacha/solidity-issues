@r0qs 

My bad, I committed the fix for #14101 to this PR and reverted it, so your approval is stale. 

> By the way, unrelated, but since you have done a great job already fixing many things in the docs, maybe you would be interested in taking over this PR here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13951

I think I can fix it, but I won't be able to work on it tomorrow, so I'll try to fix day after tomorrow!
