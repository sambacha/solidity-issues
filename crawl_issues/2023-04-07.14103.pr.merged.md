A bunch of test cases I added while working on suffixes in #12656. They make sense even without the suffix PR so I'm submitting them separately.
- Repro from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12656#issuecomment-1498840380.
- Test case from operator blog post.
- Extra tests for denominations.
