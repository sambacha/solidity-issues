# [\#14104 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14104) `merged`: Refactor literal parsing before adding suffixes
**Labels**: `roadmap`

Part of #13718.

This is a tiny refactor in preparation for the main suffix PR (#12656). Extracted into a separate PR to reduce the main PR as much as possible.

It does not change anything in the parser behavior, just moves stuff around to make it easy to insert suffix parsing code.
