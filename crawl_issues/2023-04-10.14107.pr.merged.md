Partially implements https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14073. The remaining will be done in future PRs.

- Introduces version `Shanghai`.
- Assembler supports use of `push0` from EVM versions starting at Shanghai.
- Basic tests and docs.

Since this uses a new opcode, and it's used "underneath", so the user does not have fully control over it, it totally breaks compatibility with previous forks. For instance if you try to deploy any contract compiled with the `0.8.20` in any fork previous to `Shanghai` it will break the contract ( since the `push0` will be processed as an `INVALID`).
This could break contracts on others EVM compatible chains therefore I suggest to apply this change in a major version change such as `0.9`

Thank you^^

That's true for any previous hard-forks as well - the compiler can be set up to the EVM version you want and is backwards-compatible up until homestead. It has generally always followed EVM mainnet in the *default* version, so in the first solc release after the hardfork we will switch the default (note that this PR does *not* switch the default, but merely adds support upon explicit request for now).

Overriding this default especially in the connection with other EVM-compatible chains is a job for the framework involved, for the compiler I strongly tend towards sticking to the traditional convention.

@hrkrshnn Can you squash the commits and remove the comments? Then I'd probably just merge this for now.
We can then try to raise some more input on switching the default before the hard-fork, to give people the chance to sway my mind on just switching the default with the fork :-).

Ah come on, I painfully separated all the commits ðŸ˜¢ Will fix the pending comments today.

Haha, ok, just removing the comments is also just fine :-).

Not that there's *that* much time left before Shanghai to decide this :-). But we can also leave it as paris as default for the next release and ultimately decide for the release after, we've been lagging behind slightly in the past already anyways. Or we still take some time to get input on this before releasing.

Just removed both the comments (the todo and fixme).
