# [\#14112 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14112) `closed`: Reverse lookup for DataFlowAnalyzer
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `optimizer`, `roadmap`

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13719 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13822.

Benchmarking is run on the [contract](https://gist.github.com/chriseth/def56b241b480fa2bc52d173fdc8e451).

Mostly helps with CSE (`CommonSubexpressionEleminator`) and `LiteralRematerialiser`, `LoadResolver` and `ExpressionSimplifier`, i.e. steps that inherit from and thus rely on the `DataFlowAnalyzer`. The results are as follows:

This PR is essentially a rework of @chriseth's [Improve DataFlowAnalyzer PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13823/files#diff-42ab9538e190e995d9019d40d1a7cd57bcce79e729158981cfad1b29bd07d0a0), which includes many other improvements (of which I think all were merged already in separate PRs).
The question here is whether we'd prefer the approach here (where the in-order and reverse lookup are wrapped in a separate class), or in Chris' PR, where the reverse lookup is just added to the `DataFlowAnalyzer::State` object and then used directly from there.

I wonder what's happening with ElementFi. I double checked I got the numbers from the right pages and looks like it really took ~30 s longer. May be worth checking if it's repeatable or just a fluke. Still, some other times increased too so there might be something more to it.

The table contains only the `real` time. Full results are below in case anyone's interested.

I gathered fresh timing data (and translated the original data into the same format).

1. It seems to me that all the timing differences we see in external tests, even the positive ones may be just noise:
    - The differences are much smaller now. Especially for `zeppelin`, `elementfi` and `colony`, which originally had the largest difference, the difference not only decreased but completely reversed direction.
    - In some cases the differences flip between positive and negative in different runs for the same project.
    - `zeppelin` and `uniswap` compile much faster on `develop` now. In case of `zeppelin` this could very well be due to upstream changes in tests. For `uniswap` though we have a forked repo.
2. On the other hand, there is actually a 2x difference in our own timing benchmark - though only for a single contract (`chains.sol`). Others, e.g. `OptimizorClub.sol`, do not seem affected.

My conclusion here is that there's no strong evidence that this change significantly affects external tests, be it positively or negatively. If there is a difference, it's lower than the normal variance of CI timing. Still, the change does seem to help one especially pathological contract from our repo (`chains.sol`). I wonder if it might be because profiling was done specifically on that contract and the PR addresses its specific bottleneck and the bottleneck happens to be different than in more common scenarios?

This PR has been open for more than a year, with the improvements somewhat inconclusive. I'll be closing it, at least for the time being, since we're working on different (macro) improvements on the via-ir pipeline, which should yield significantly better results. We can re-open this in the future if need be, or use it as a reference at the very least.
