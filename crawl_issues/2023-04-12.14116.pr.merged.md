Adds:
 - compiler setting `bmcLoopIterations`
 - command line parameter `model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations`
 
 that specify number of times that BMC model checker runs loops.

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12892

I have some questions regarding the expected answer for the following example:
```
contract C
{
	function f() public pure {
		uint x = 0;
		while (x < 5) {
			x = x + 1;
		}
		assert(x == 5);
                assert(x == 3);
	}
}
```
The result for BMC loop iterations:
5 => Only the second assertion is reported as violated (OK)
4 => Both assertions are reported as violated (probably OK, but not necessarily, I could argue for both sides)
3 => Only the first assertion is reported as violated (weird  IMHO)

Also, if assertion is reported, there is a note
`Note that some information is erased after the execution of loops.
You can re-introduce information using require().`

It seems to me, that this message is no longer true, i.e., the context is not havoced anymore after a loop.
I don't know if you have discussed what should be the expected behaviour when the bound on number of iteration is not sufficient to exit the loop, but in my opinion the current behaviour is not the right one.

Agree it's weird, but it's just a side-effect of it being an underapproximation.

> Also, if assertion is reported, there is a note

Agree we should remove the node, or actually change it to say false negatives are possible.

This does not fit into my definition of underapproximation. If we were to follow the usual semantics of BMC, then I think no error should be reported as reachable for unrolling limits 3 and 4 in my example, simply because that unrolling limit is insufficient to exit the loop. I think it would be good to agree on (and document) the intended semantics of BMC.
Should we maybe have a call on this topic? @leonardoalt @pgebal

> with BMC iterations at least 4? The purpose is to test that giving the analysis more iterations, where the loop condition would be again satisfied _if_ the loop continue executing, does not break the correctness.
> 
> We also discussed with Leo that it would be good to have 3 variants for the tests: one where the number of BMC iterations is not enough to leave the loop, one where the number of BMC iterations is exactly enough to leave the loop and one where the number of BMC iterations is more than what is required to leave the loop.

It's already been rebased. Leo's commits that fix conditionals are included.

I'll add those tests.

According to the `git log` it has not been rebased. Also, the output of the test `do_while_bmc_iterations_break_8.sol` would have been changed, but it is not.

@blishko Right, I must have done that on some other branch.

It's rebased now and I added the tests you asked for.

@leonardoalt 
No problem. This has to be tested thoroughly.

I added those tests.

There is one more bug in error message formatting, that's why code style check didn't pass.
