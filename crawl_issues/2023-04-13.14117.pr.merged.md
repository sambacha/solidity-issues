# [\#14117 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14117) `merged`: Change the constant optimizer to make use of `PUSH0`
**Labels**: `optimizer`

Part of #14073.

This change only affects large copies using codecopy (which are supposedly rare).

*(It will be fun changing this code for EOF, i.e. use `DATACOPY` or replace it entirely with a single `DATALOADN`.)*

For some reason it has a merge conflict in the peephole optimizer now, so that at least needs to be resolved.
But maybe that's all of it now, so ping me once that's done, then I'll have another look!

What we could still do to offset the regressions would be to add another peephole optimization - if for any pattern like

``[AssemblyItem A] [AssemblyItem B] [AssemblyItem C] [TAG] [AssemblyItem X] [AssemblyItem Y] [AssemblyItem Z]``

Where `A == X && B == Y && C == Z` *and* `C` is control flow breaking (it terminates or reverts or jumps unconditionally), we can replace this with

``[TAG] [AssemblyItem A] [AssemblyItem B] [AssemblyItem C]``

But I wonder whether there's a nicer way to do this than that... this is actually closer to block deduplication than to peephole optimization, but we cannot really use that mechanism, since one of the blocks has to remain (since it's fallen into from previous code) - and thereby also doesn't have a jumpdest/tag to mark it...

Due to that, the quickest solution would probably be to add such peephole optimization rules - it should be sufficient to add them for sequences of one, two or three assembly items, that should cover all these cases that are artifacts of partial inlining...

I investigated the last 6 problematic cases of the hardhat tests and all cases are related to the introduction of the `DeduplicateNextTagSizeX` methods in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14117/commits/9b1792f4000cfa950391a6e367cf5b327436a3c7.
They open up some possible optimizations that result in a different enough generated code that causes the failings in the hardhat stack trace tests since they rely on certain patterns being produced.
The first one that appears on the [logs](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/34684/workflows/825edd3a-a9c8-46cf-b691-d9330960f4bf/jobs/1572926), for example, checks function `test` with `b=false` in the following [solidity code](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/53c422c042a527930cae6b5d8cb748bbdbe51b44/packages/hardhat-core/test/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/test-files/0_8/revert-without-message/modifiers/call-message/multiple-modifiers-require/c.sol):

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract C {

  modifier m2(bool b)  {
    require(b);
    _;
  }

  function test(bool b) m1(b) m2(b) public {
    revert();
  }

  modifier m1(bool b)  {
    _;
  }

}
```

The [stack trace expectation](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/blob/53c422c042a527930cae6b5d8cb748bbdbe51b44/packages/hardhat-core/test/internal/hardhat-network/stack-traces/test-files/0_8/revert-without-message/modifiers/call-message/multiple-modifiers-require/test.json) shows it expected the revert error raised from the `require(b);` at line 6:
```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "file": "c.sol",
      "contract": "C"
    },
    {
      "to": 0,
      "params": [false],
      "function": "test",
      "stackTrace": [
        {
          "type": "CALLSTACK_ENTRY",
          "sourceReference": {
            "contract": "C",
            "file": "c.sol",
            "function": "test",
            "line": 10
          }
        },
        {
          "type": "REVERT_ERROR",
          "sourceReference": {
            "contract": "C",

            "function": "m2",
            "line": 6
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


The code generated by the compiler before this PR contains the part related to that:
```
    tag_7:
        /* "c.sol":119:120  b */
      dup1
        /* "c.sol":125:126  b */
      dup2
        /* "c.sol":76:77  b */
      dup1
        /* "c.sol":68:78  require(b) */
      tag_10
      jumpi
      0x00
      dup1
      revert
    tag_10:
        /* "c.sol":141:149  revert() */
      0x00
      dup1
      revert
```
But the code generated with the introduction of this PR is optimized further and removes the asm related to the `require`, according to these steps:
(Already assuming all `revert dup1 0x00` transformed to `revert 0x00 0x00` because it is cheaper than `dup1`)
1.  Remove `revert 0x00 0x00` before `tag_10` which does exactly the same (`PeepholeOptimiser::DeduplicateNextTagSize3`)
2. Remove `jumpi tag_10` because now it is right before `tag_10`. Also note that as a consequence `dup1` is also removed since it is the condition of the `jumpi` (`PeepholeOptimiser::JumpToNext`)
3. Remove `tag_10` (only the tag itself, not the instructions following it) because its only reference was removed in step 2 (`JumpdestRemover::optimise`)
4. The remaining `dup2 dup1` before `revert 0x00 0x00` are removed (`PeepholeOptimiser::OpReturnRevert`)

The final result contains only the code corresponding to the `revert` in line 11:
```
    tag_7:
        /* "c.sol":141:149  revert() */
      revert(0x00, 0x00)
```

The `require` was completely removed from the asm, which makes sense from an optimization point of view, and that causes a mismatch with the expected stack trace.
The other failing tests are similar cases where a specific snippet of code is optimized out while that was not the case before.
