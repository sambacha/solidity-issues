Depends on #12656.

Based on my write up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13718#issuecomment-1503203213.

- [ ] ~More/better examples.~
- [x] Better explain the differences between suffixes and denominations.
- [x] Check if there are some places in the docs that should link to the new docs.

This is still work in progress but I would not mind some preliminary reviews. When ready, I'm going to merge this into the main suffix PR and there it will be reviewed by Daniel.

This is now done and ready for a full review.

I think I'll actually leave it as a separate PR instead of lumping it together with everything else in #12656. If it gets approved before suffixes are merged I can merge it into that PR anyway.

I decided not to add too many more examples. The only non-straighforward thing about suffixes is the fractional decomposition and that's explained at length already.

I also extracted some smaller refactors into a separate PR (#14123) to keep this one focused strictly on new docs, without cleanups or refactors.

I think I've addressed (or responded to) all comments for now.

And maybe one thing that I was just thinking after reading the documentation: is everything done during compile-time? or is there any runtime-code generated? in general, all literals and their suffixes should be evaluated during compile-time (e.g. literals are constants), so there is no real need for any runtime-code. However, basically I'm not sure how the current implementation is doing that exactly, because its not yet part of the documentation - if I didn't missed that.

Maybe what I wrote here is a bit confusing. What I basically meant here is whether the evaluation of suffixes is done at compile-time and therefore the results of suffixes got just reduced to "constants" or whether suffixes are evaluated at run-time - and therefore introduce overhead.

@aarlt Not everything. Fractional decomposition itself is done at a compilation time so `4.2 f` is actually equivalent to `f(42, 1)` and does not incur any **extra** cost. I added a note about that now.

Still, a suffix call is just a function call and I think this is already much emphasized in the text. I intentionally included a "suffix call" in the section on function calls as just another way to call a function rather than special syntax doing new things. Currently functions cannot be evaluated at compilation time and suffixes are not either. The optimizer may inline them and evaluate the expression if it's simple enough but that's never guaranteed. At the language level it's still considered a runtime calculation. For example you cannot put a suffix on a literal that determines the size of a static array.

It will change when we get compile-time expression evaluation but that won't be specific to just suffixes, but will cover all functions that can be evaluated in such a way.

I think all the comments have been addressed. PR is ready for another round.

We decided not to merge this feature so I'm closing the PR. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13718#issuecomment-1551488965 for details.
