# [\#14123 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14123) `merged`: Literal-related documentation and index tweaks
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Extracted from #14121 so that there we can focus strictly on the new docs without the noise form cleanup/refactors.

The PR makes index entries more consistent, fixes the entry for `receive` and also rewords the part of the description of hexadecimal string literals that seems to be untrue.
