Part of #13718.
Originally requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13790#discussion_r1113063168.

One of the quirks we noticed when implementing user-defined operators was that `TokenTraits::isUnaryOp()` treats `+` as a unary operator, even though the use of unary plus is an error in Solidity. This is an attempt to straighten this out.

How weird. My pushes to the branch do not show up in the PR and don't trigger CI, even though they're clearly visible in [`make-plus-binary-only`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/make-plus-binary-only).

I tried to close the PR and reopen hoping that github would somehow catch up but now I cannot reopen it... Oh well, I'm going to just submit a new PR.

New PR: #14139.
