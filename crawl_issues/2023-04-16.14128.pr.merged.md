Generating a Golang antlr4 parser from the grammar is currently broken due to some idiosyncratic language incompatibilities:
 - `boolean` -> `bool` is not supported (upstreaming a fix here: github.com/antlr/antlr4/pull/4231)
 - Golang generation generates both a `NewExpressionContext` `struct` and `function` in the same package, causing a redeclaration error
 - start / end indexing conflicts with Antlr4 Golang runtime `GetStart` and `GetEnd` methods

This PR fixes the second two by:
 - Renaming `NewExpression` to `NewExpr` which changes the `NewExpressionContext` type to `NewExprContext`
 - Renaming `start` and `end` to `startIndex` and `endIndex`
