I pushed this branch last September and not sure what happened to it. Will rebase now to see.

The error in the windows build is due to failing to link the jsonccp:
```
circleci@packer-62f2a351-716f-548b-6ad8-257cea95429e  ~/project/build/solc/Release (jsoncpp-1.9.5)
$ ./solc.exe
C:/Users/circleci/project/build/solc/Release/solc.exe: error while loading shared libraries: jsoncpp.dll: cannot open shared object file: No such file
 or directory
 ```
 
 Sadly `powershell` does not show such error, so you need to login via ssh on the CI and try to run solc through bash.
 ```
 PS C:\Users\circleci\project> file .\build\solc\Release\solc.exe
.\build\solc\Release\solc.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
PS C:\Users\circleci\project> .\build\solc\Release\solc.exe
PS C:\Users\circleci\project>
```

Setting ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` to ``OFF`` in json-cpp cmake config may fix that... they probably broke things with the vague release note mention of "Minor bug-fixes (including for cmake)" :-).

I'm a bit torn on this one by the way - on the one hand, it's kind of a unnecessary distraction - on the other hand I'm in general 100% behind keeping dependencies up-to-date and this has been way overdue, so :-)...

This is the diff: https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/compare/1.9.3...1.9.5

Changes for 2020 and 2021.

New CMake additions:
```cmake
option(JSONCPP_STATIC_WINDOWS_RUNTIME "Use static (MT/MTd) Windows runtime" OFF)
option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS "Build jsoncpp_lib as a shared library." ON)
option(BUILD_STATIC_LIBS "Build jsoncpp_lib as a static library." ON)
option(BUILD_OBJECT_LIBS "Build jsoncpp_lib as a object library." ON)
```

I wouldn't spend days on this, but perhaps time boxing to a few hours tops could be useful to avoid more follow distance to jsoncpp.

It does have a few other C++ improvements, so perhaps it may be faster.
