# [\#14133 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14133) `merged`: Emit PUSH0 as junk in evm code transform, if available.

Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14073

Changes the code transform towards producing a less-weird ``PUSH0`` instead of ``CODESIZE`` - this doesn't make much of a difference other than aesthetics (``codesize`` occurring in these cases was a bit weird).

I'd have said this falls under the entry of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14107

Added an explicit changelog entry now in any case.
