# [\#14139 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14139) `merged`: Make plus binary only (second attempt)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-04-18 15:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14139):

Part of #13718.
Originally requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13790#discussion_r1113063168.
Replaces #14124.

One of the quirks we noticed when implementing user-defined operators was that `TokenTraits::isUnaryOp()` treats `+` as a unary operator, even though the use of unary plus is an error in Solidity. This is an attempt to straighten this out.
