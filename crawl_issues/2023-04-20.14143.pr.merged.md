**Labels**: `refactor`

This PR reverts most of my changes from #14087 and tweaks the error message in a different way, that does not require printing the type.

Discussion for reference: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12656#discussion_r1169051859, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12656#discussion_r1169057251.

The main problem with `Type::categoryName()` is that for most values it tries to describe the instance of the type, rather than the category - which fits the error message but is not a good formatter for that enum in general. I could fix it, but I actually found a better way to word it independently of its type (compared to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14087#discussion_r1156057504), so I'll go with that instead.
