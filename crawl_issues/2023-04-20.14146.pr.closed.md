**Comments:**

- Changed `std::unordered_map<YulString, std::set<YulString>` to a very simple custom simple Multimap with open addressing.

**Observations:**

- In the original `std::unordered_map<YulString, std::set<YulString>`, the `std::unordered_map` grows up to a ballpark of 2000+ entries, while most of the `std::set`s only have 0,1,2 entries.

- Storing only the `id` of the YulString as the key may improve timings by a fraction of a second. 

- Using `std::map`, `ankerl::unordered_dense` for the `unordered_map` doesn't seem to affect performance noticeably.

- Using `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::forward_list` for the `set` doesn't seem to affect performance noticeably.

Reduces the compile time from mid 9.x seconds to low 8.x seconds for this example: https://gist.github.com/chriseth/def56b241b480fa2bc52d173fdc8e451 

`time ./solc/solc --bin -o output StdCheatsSafe.sol --via-ir --optimize --optimize-runs=1000000 --overwrite`.

**gprof output after optimization:**

Nvm, ignore this. Just go with #14154 without the custom map.
