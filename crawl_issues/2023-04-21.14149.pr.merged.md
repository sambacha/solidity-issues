# [\#14149 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14149) `merged`: Minimal Yul optimizations by default
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `roadmap`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-04-21 17:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14149):

Resolves #13972.

~Still work in progress. The change is implemented, but I still need to resolve a few smaller issues~:
- [x] Fix remaining CLI tests (the `Testing assemble, yul, strict-assembly and optimize...` step).
- [x] Figure out why `semanticTests/functionCall/call_options_overload` is now failing on homestead via IR.
- [x] The change should only affect via-IR mode.
- [x] Don't try to run any optimizer steps or stack-to-memory or the optimized code transform on sources that contain `msize`.
- [x] ~Figure out if some of the test suites actually require disabled Yul optimizer and need to be switched to the `none` preset (rather than `minimal`, which now has it enabled).~
- [x] ~Check if any additional optimizer setting combination should have a metadata test in `StandardCompiler.cpp`.~
- [x] Fix several tests that depend on things not getting optimized out.
- [ ] (Optional) Add workarounds for a few external tests that now compile but still do not pass their test suites.

We just generally *not* run the yul optimizer if we find an msize. No other way to deal with this really.

Also: don't touch legacy compilation with any of this - this will only make things worse and not improve things, since we can't run the optimized code transform in such cases.
This is *only* meant to affect via-IR compilation mode.

Hmmm... so this means I should apply the new defaults only when `--viair`/`viair: true` is present? Should be doable, though will complicate option parsing a bit (`viair` is not under `optimizer` so I'll have to reach out when parsing optimizer settings, which will be a hack).

Yes, this was always only meant to affect via-IR mode (see the issue description).
You don't need to hack this into parsing, though - you can just parse the options as we used to and then amend the defaults for unoptimized via-IR non-homestead runs.

If it's easier, you can also not touch the options parsing or defaults at all and just detect "unoptimized+via-IR+>homestead" directly before the code transform and only run the minimal optimizer steps and the optimized code transform there directly. I can't tell which is easier without looking into it deeply myself, you'll have to judge which is better :-).

ok, I can't tell right now either so I'll check. But it sounds better than modifying the settings after the fact and potentially bypassing some validation someone might add in the future not realizing we're doing that.

Yeah, I was just wondering about the metadata - but if we *always* have the compiler run the minimal optimizations and the optimized code transform with the optimizer disabled, it's perfectly fine for the metadata to just plainly store this as a disabled optimizer as well, so yeah, that's probably easiest really.

I switched to a solution that does not require changing optimizer settings at all. Instead I simply do the minimal optimizations in `YulStack` when Yul optimizer is disabled. The nice thing about it is that it requires very few changes outside of tests and covers only the cases we need: `YulStack` happens to be used exactly by the parts of code that do standalone IR compilation and assembling while anything on legacy that uses bits of Yul (like inline assembly or Yul util functions) reaches directly for more specific classes.

So that part has been redone. Now the annoying thing is `msize`. I thought I'd just detect it in `YulStack` but turns out that we only disallow it specifically for inline assembly, and optimizing pure Yul code using `msize` is allowed. This means I cannot simply check if `msize` is present in the Yul AST, I have to know if it came from inline assembly. I'll probably need to somehow pass on that info to the stack from analysis. Which is annoying, because it feels like a hack on an otherwise quite elegant solution.

After discussing with @ekpyron turns out that just detecting `msize` in Yul is really what we want - but we do that only with optimizer disabled. This is now implemented.

Not marking as ready to review yet because I still need to review the updated expectations to make sure I didn't break anything and also rebase on `develop` after ewasm removal.

This is now ready for review.

Some external tests are failing but this seems unrelated to the PR (something with upstream dependencies, specifically `ethereum-waffle`).

Rebased.

> One thing we could still check (no need to add tests for it, but just to confirm locally at a few random example cases) is that this won't negatively affect source mappings (given concerns like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12980#issuecomment-1568278894)

It seems fine.

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12980#issuecomment-1580764218 for details.

[`t_native_test_ext_zeppelin` is failing](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30079/workflows/3fcedd9a-7fd1-4570-85af-b2c3cb298d2b/jobs/1336795) and I wonder if this is caused by the changes from this PR:

```
Warning: Contract initcode size is 49410 bytes and exceeds 49152 bytes (a limit introduced in Shanghai). This contract may not be deployable on Mainnet. Consider enabling the optimizer (with a low "runs" value!), turning off revert strings, or using libraries.
 --> contracts-exposed/mocks/docs/governance/MyGovernor.sol:7:1:
```

It was passing before so this is definitely not PR on its own, but if the contracts changed upstream, it's possible that they are now just at the limit and the PR is pushing them over it...

Ah, wait, that happens only in the `ir-no-optimize` preset, which would not even compile before this PR. So it going over the limit is not entirely unexpected, just weird that it started happening all of a sudden, but it does look like some upstream change merged in the last week could have caused it. OZ is definitely not testing unoptimized compilation via IR on their side. I'm just going to disable that preset.
