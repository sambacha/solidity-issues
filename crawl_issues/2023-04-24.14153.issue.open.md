## Description

The SemVer parser allows the following constraint to go through:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.19 .0;
```

But as far as I can tell this is not valid SemVer syntax, as can be cross referenced here: https://jubianchi.github.io/semver-check/#/constraint/0.8.19%20.0

I also don't see this form tested in the vectors for [SemVerMatcher.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libsolidity/SemVerMatcher.cpp#L201) so I assume it's a parsing oversight? 

From the AST, the compiler seems to treat this as a range constraint of sorts:

```
      {
         "id":1,
         "literals":[
            "solidity",
            "0.8",
            ".19",
            ".0"
         ],
         "nodeType":"PragmaDirective",
         "src":"35:26:4"
      },
```

This is a hard "violation" to catch with regex because spaces are allowed in SemVer normally, so would be best to remove this so that people do not use it as it ends up requiring a lot of extra code outside of the usual semver libs to process this nonstandard form.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.19
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): paris
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: linux/amd64

## Steps to Reproduce

Compile the following contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.19 .0;

contract Test {}
```

With:

```
solc Test.sol
```

Expected result would be `Error: Invalid version pragma.`, but the contract compiles without error.
