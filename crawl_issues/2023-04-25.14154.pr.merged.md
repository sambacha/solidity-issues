**Rationale:**

Right now, the `std::map<StackSlot, int>` uses a vtable generated by `std::variant` in the lookup.

This causes a lot of extra overhead in the tight inner loops of the map's lookup.

Instead, we can just perform the indirection once per lookup and forward to a specialized map for the corresponding type.

This greatly reduces the compile time from 15.x seconds to 9.x seconds on the [StdCheatsSafe example (a.k.a. Chains.sol)](https://gist.github.com/chriseth/def56b241b480fa2bc52d173fdc8e451):

`time ./solc/solc --bin -o output StdCheatsSafe.sol --via-ir --optimize --optimize-runs=1000000 --overwrite`

**Comments:**

For better performance, we could use a custom open addressing map fine-tuned for storage of `uintptr_t`s.

Not all data types are best suited for open addressing. Literals (u256s) perform better in a `std::map`, as they occupy multiple 64-bit words.

While this is spot-on after our previous recent work the probably slowest painpoint during IR-compilation, a better way to deal with the issue would be to algorithmically get around needing these multiplicity maps in the first place, rather than squeezing a hand-crafted container into something that was meant to be temporary anyways (which has maintenance and security implications as hinted at by @hrkrshnn above).
If just splitting the map into several (still standard) maps based on the variant contents already helps significantly (which it reasonably could, it should reduce the number of comparisons significantly), we could do that part alone, though.

We can use the `std::map` and call it a day, although I'd recommend using a custom open addressing map for the free real estate. It's not that complex as we don't need deletions. It's just a little more than a fancy linear search.

Some benchmark numbers between the different maps:
https://gist.github.com/Vectorized/3ef416426db1ea0dfb409d7fc2f39bdd

Compiled with clang -O3.

Basically, the custom StackSlotHashMap is 2x faster than `std::map` for a simulated use case for Chains.sol.

Using the custom StackSlotHashMap instead of `std::map` drops the ext_zeppelin compile time from 6m17s to 5m51s.

gprof after this PR + the other PR on reverse lookup.
https://gist.github.com/Vectorized/d1e541a41113bf63ea8eb44a2447cc78

After this optimization, the multiplicity mapping (the main hog of shuffling) takes up 15% of the time (the percentage is actually lesser if u exclude the reverse lookup PR). This is low enough such that more attention can be spend on optimizing other areas.

I've changed to `std::map` for the time being. Really hope we can use the custom StackSlotHashMap. Simply make it run so fast that it doesn't really matter.

I think and my gut feel says we _really_ should use StackSlotHashMap.

Absolutely not. Under no circumstances will we sacrifice the safety and functionality of the compiler by using a custom made data structure with zero test coverage and no previous production runtime.

Nvm, just go without the custom map.

Throwing in an outside perspective. The `--via-ir` pipeline is absolutely unusable on projects with scale, taking several minutes to compile. I've had to spend painful hours refactoring to use the generic compiler precisely because of the ridiculously slow compile times. Understand the solc team is concerned about safety but if real optimization improvements (like Vectorized is generously offering) aren't made, nobody will use this in the most important projects.

You clearly don't if you're suggesting we include a custom data structure partly written by ChapGPT that has never seen production use, and is covered by zero tests.

> Nvm, just go without the custom map.

Please do, and thanks for working on this. Also, don't take any of this personally - no matter who the custom data structure comes from, unless it's from a reputable c++ library, it's not going to be merged.

@0xfoobar the team is aware of that and working on it as one of the current priorities, as you can see in open PRs. However the pain does not justify simply merging whatever without thorough analysis. Surely you know this is common practice? External contributions are always welcome, especially from skilled people such as @Vectorized . That does not mean any improvement will go in at all costs, there are trade offs that must be taken into account. The team has stated what they wish to use from the PR, and what they don't. I really don't understand how that's so polemic, or rather that you don't seem to understand this process in OSS.

I merged the version of this PR without the custom map implementation. We do have follow-up changes of the shuffling algorithm staged that should improve the performance even beyond what the custom hash map would have given us - but it will take a bit more time to finalize those changes, so unfortunately they won't make it into the impending next release.
But thank you very much for the immediate improvement!
