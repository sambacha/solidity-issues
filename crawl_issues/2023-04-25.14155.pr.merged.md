This PR is a first attempt to create a easy way to analyze the current stack shuffling algorithm. It migrates an old boost test to the `isoltest` format for stack layouts.

The format consists of two source entries each one representing the initial stack and the target stack layout respectively.
Then it logs the steps used by `createStackLayout` as the output of the test, showing the current stack layout followed by the operation performed that resulted in the next stack layout until the target layout is reached.
