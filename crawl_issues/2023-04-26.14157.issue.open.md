# [\#14157 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14157) `open`: Support EIP-712 typehash in `type`
**Labels**: `feature`

## Abstract

Let's add support of `type(State).typehash` for structs, returning `bytes32` hashed stringed structure.

## Motivation

EIP-712 type hashes are pretty popular among smart contract of different companies. I believe it makes sense to support it on Solidity language layer.

## Specification

```solidity
bytes32 constant public STATE_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    "State("
        "uint256 nonce,"
        "uint256 totalSpent,"
        "uint256 totalRefunded"
    ")"
);
```
=>
```solidity
struct State {
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 totalSpent;
    uint256 totalRefunded;
}

bytes32 constant public STATE_TYPEHASH = type(State).typehash;
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Not sure

I really like that idea. I feel like instead of calling it `State`, the semantics `Topic` would be nicer. Also, I would like to add a further request for commonly known type hashes such as the one for [`permit`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612).

Instead of doing the following (or the approach in the feature request above):

```solidity
bytes32 private constant _PERMIT_TYPEHASH = keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)");
```

one could simply query the type hash like the following without importing the `EIP-2612` interface itself (i.e. `Permit` is already built-in):

```solidity
bytes32 private constant _PERMIT_TYPEHASH = type(Permit).typehash
```

This would require restricting the namespace for `type` but I feel that it's becoming less error-prone like that due to common mistakes made such as the usage of `uint` alias in the hash.

@pcaversaccio `type(X)` is already type-sensitive: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/units-and-global-variables.html

@k06a We discussed this in the call. We're fine with proceeding here. Would appreciate if you can lead the implementation, we can give some pointers on missing things, and review it.

What do you think of adding runtime function to compute hash of the exact struct entity:
```solidity
State memory state;
type(State).hashStruct(state);
```

Apologies @k06a, I've been heads down on @spearbit lately. I'll find some time on the weekend to review this.
