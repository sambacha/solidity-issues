Thanks for the contribution! Unfortunately, this PR seems to be based on version 0.4.21 which is ancient at this point. We don't accept PRs against older versions of the docs. Keeping them all updated would be unmanageable.

I'm closing the PR, but feel free to rebase on `develop` and reopen if the problem still exists there.
