Fixes: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14058 Medium resource class tags have been replaced with macos.x86.medium.gen2 and large resource class tags have been replaced with macos.m1.large.gen1. I believe the updated Gen2 resource is available with the free plan. and the new large resource is coming in at 400 credits per minute

I think I messed up the squashing process and all my previous changes got reverted. I am just going to create a new pull request so everything looks cleaner.
