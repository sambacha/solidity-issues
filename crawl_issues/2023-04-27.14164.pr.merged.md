Fixes: #14058 base_osx now has the macos.x86.medium.gen2 tag and base_osx_large has the macos.m1.large.gen1 tag. I believe the updated Gen2 resource is available with the free plan. and the new large resource is coming in at 400 credits per minute

Thanks @BraxWong but you didn't need to close the other one, we could have fixed the squash for you if you have asked. Anyway, I guess we will also need to update the `Xcode` version in this PR, see: https://discuss.circleci.com/t/announcing-apple-silicon-m1-support-now-available/46908

We are currently using `13.2.0` and it seems that we should update it to `14.2.0`. Could you please also update those? This may fix the CI error: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29455/workflows/d86e7b98-c680-489e-80d9-92ca744129e5/jobs/1308312
