> Testing is good enough (if you want, you can still add tests for it occurring twice in the beginning and once in the beginning plus once later on - but since that's all covered by the preexisting logic, it's also fine if not - the same goes for the experimental flag in CBOR metadata: could be tested specifically, but it's already tested for any experimental pragma, so also fine)

@ekpyron precisely why I didn't add such tests, as they would be completely redundant, i.e. adding them for `experimental solidity` covers the same path as `experimental ABIEncoderV2`, or `SMTChecker`.
