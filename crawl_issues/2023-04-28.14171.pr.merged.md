I guess it would make sense to change the import/export script to additionally test the import via standard-json, right?

At a quick glance already looks mostly fine - but we need to change the casing of ``AST`` back in combined-json output - or am I missing something here that explains why that *wouldn't* be a full breaking change :-)?

Do we leave this completely undocumented for now? That would be in line with considering it experimental at first. I'd then have a few people developing tooling in mind to point them to it to try if it works for them and we can add docs later depending on feedback.

The alternative would be to add some mention of this right away in https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description, while mentioning that we don't guarantee smooth error reporting or even sound behaviour on invalid ASTs for the time being.
