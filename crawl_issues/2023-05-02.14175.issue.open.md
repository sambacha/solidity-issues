## Description

```solidity
function fixed_number_test(fixed num) {
    // Compiles
    if (num > 2.5) {}
    // Does not compile
    if (2.5 < num) {}
}
```

When comparing a fixed/ufixed number and a rational literal, the Solidity compiler compiles the code when the fixed number is on the LHS side, but it doesn't when LHS and RHS are swapped.

## Environment

- Compiler version: `0.8.18+commit.87f61d96.Linux.g++`
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Direct invocation from CLI (`solc test.sol`)
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS server

## Steps to Reproduce

Save the above code as `test.sol` and run `solc test.sol`. Line 3 compiles, but line 5 fails to compile with message "Built-in binary operator < cannot be applied to types rational_const 5 / 2 and fixed128x18. Fractional literals not supported."

I expect Solidity to treat both lines equally.

This is indeed a minor bug. However, note that fixed point types are not supported in general and you won't actually get any bytecode from any sources that involve operations on fixed point types. So the first variant also only compiles "in vacuum", i.e. without actually using it, while attempting to use it will produce an error later during compilation.

But indeed the error reporting on this should be more consistent and also catch the first case earlier.

 The second if statement does not compile because the constant 2.5 is on the left side of the comparison operator, violating the ordering rules for fixed point numbers in Solidity.
