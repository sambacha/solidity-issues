# [\#14176 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14176) `merged`: Move AST annotation of internal function dispatch IDs to ContractDefinition

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14050, when exporting the internal function IDs to the AST we also changed the mechanism used to assign such IDs using a global counter which stays the same across compiling different contracts. Before we used to create a new context with new function IDs for each contract we compiled.

As pointed out by @haltman-at and @ekpyron on our matrix channel, that change may lead to problems due to the use of the global counter for assigning the IDs, since compiling a contract in isolation would produce different function IDs and thus different output compared to compiling it together with other sources.

This PR proposes a fix to the problem, making the ID generation to be contract-based as before and moving the annotation to the contract definition in the AST.

Needs to also adjust the changelog entry we added in the other PR. But yeah, this is in fact the better solution.
