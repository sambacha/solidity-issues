# [\#14177 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14177) `merged`: Add support for Yul ASTs output
**Labels**: `external contribution :star:`

Adds:

- Command line output option`--ast-compact-json` with Yul input. This outputs the Yul AST in JSON compact format.
- Command line output options `--ir-ast-json` and `--ir-optimized-ast-json` with Solidity input. Those options will produce the AST of the Yul-IR and the optimized Yul-IR, respectively, in JSON compact format. 

Resolves #9590. Although #9590 was grouped with #13720 which appears to have other dependencies, #9590 itself is pretty straightforward and can be implemented similarly to the Solidity ASTs that are already present.

For reference, since we talked about this in our call earlier today:
By "standard json" I mean this: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description, the entry point in the code is https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp

Via command line this input/output mode is enabled via ``--standard-json``.

We can, for example, add ``ast.ir`` as a possible field to the file-level output selections when compiling Solidity - and can just output the Yul AST when requesting `ast` on Yul input.

One more thing I forgot to consider yesterday:
When compiling Solidity to IR, we equip the resulting Yul code with special comments like
```
/// @src 1:0:14  "contract C {..."
```
which encode the source locations of the original Solidity file.

Furthermore, we will eventually also want to *import* the Yul ASTs back with the goal to have identical compiler outputs after exporting the Yul AST and then importing it back compared to a single-step compilation. Similarly, compiling to Yul first and then continuing compilation from Yul is supposed to yield identical compiler output as one-step compilation.

This PR doesn't need to address any of this, we can take care of that in subsequent steps, but it has implications for the source locations in the Yul AST:

If you start from Yul code that has comments like the ones the compiler produces when compiling solidity to IR code, the compiler should already pick up on those comments and parse the source locations - in that case those locations should also show up in the ``src`` fields of the Yul AST, just as if we had compiled from Solidity. ``nativeSrc`` could contain the Yul source locations in this case.

Now in the absence of such comments, i.e. when compiling standalone Yul, it's probably most consistent to still have both fields, ``src`` and ``nativeSrc``, but just store identical values in then, i.e. the source locations in Yul.

In this model, we can actually even make it ``originSrc`` (instead of ``src``) and ``nativeSrc`` as you had suggested - and just have pure Yul sources produce identical locations for both, while compiler-generated IR-Yul sources should get the contents of the ``@src`` comments (as should already be parsed by the compiler) as ``originSrc``.

From what I understand, origin location and native location already behave as you describe (meaning e.g. that native and origin are the same in the case of standalone Yul input). So, would it suffice if there are two fields, namely `src` and `nativeSrc` that would store originSource and nativeSource, respectively?

Yes, that should work!

FYI you can ignore the ``b_archlinux`` CI failures here on github - that's unrelated to the PR and we're working on fixing it separately.

We just discussed this internally a bit further: we want the output artifacts in standard json to be named ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst`` without the ``Json`` suffix - apart from that the design in the PR works out!

Do you know when you'll be available for rebasing the PR, making this change and fixing the remaining style comments?

@ekpyron Actually, we could use the `ast.ir` and `ast.irOptimized` structure you proposed initially on the call after all. You said that the blocker was that already have `ast` in there with the Solidity AST, but looks like that's not the case. In [current output structure](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/using-the-compiler.html#output-description) that sits under `sources` so we're free to make `ast` a dict under `contracts`.

BTW, just noticed that the output docs do not show the `irOptimized` key. We should fix that.

I actually meant ``ir.ast`` and hadn't considered ``ast.ir`` :-). But reusing and repurposing this on different levels is more confusing than nice, I'd argue, so let's just keep it at ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst``.

I'll try to keep track of all the comments and make the changes today! :)

Fair enough, though in that case I think we might still be better off with something like `astIr` and `astIrOptimized` just to emphasize that the output is the AST (not IR).

By the way, don't worry too much about the failing `ext` tests, that's unrelated to your PR and we have a fix in #14263. It should be merged soon and then rebasing your PR on `develop` should make these tests pass.

Awesome, thanks! Sure, if you could do that, that'd be great!
Edit: Also had a quick look over the fixups and looks fine to me
