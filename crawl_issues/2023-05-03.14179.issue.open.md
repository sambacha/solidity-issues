## Description

Yul compiler throws an illegible exception during development:

```
YulException: Cannot swap Slot TMP[eq, 0] with Slot RET[fun_assertEq_459]: too deep in the stack by 1 slots in [ _2 TMP[eq, 0] param_35 param_34 param_37 _mpos_31 param_36 _65 expr_12 offset _65 _69 zero_struct_UPDP_Test_Data_memory_ptr_mpos _72 var_nr _70 _2 memPtr_9 RET[fun_assertEq_459] ]
memoryguard was present.
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.19
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default settings but with `via_ir = true`.
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): foundry
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: NixOS

## Steps to Reproduce

I tried to find a minimum example for you, but I couldn't. You might need to do a full checkout of the branch, I will save the branch for you:

```
$ # have foundry installed:
$ # e.g through nix shell github:shazow/foundry.nix/monthly
$ forge --version
forge 0.2.0 (87bc53f 2023-04-02T00:04:08.631058157Z)
$ git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo.git
$ cd protocol-monorepo
$ git checkout solc-yul-exception-bug
$ yarn git:submodule:init
$ yarn install
$ cd packages/solidity-semantic-money
$ make test-SemanticMoney 
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=test forge test --match-contract SemanticMoney -vv
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 36 files with 0.8.19

Error:

```

Sorry for the digression (came facing the same cryptic error, I guess induced by Forge cheatcode assume), couldn't find you on Twitter or Tg @hellwolf

Thanks for the feedback. Yea, it should be "&&", I was focusing on recreating the error, forgot the logic itself. Yea I know of bound, I don't know if it would trigger the same bug. Btw I don't use Twitter, lens @hellwolf could do though.

I'm seeing a similar error with ViaIR = true:
```
> npx hardhat compile
YulException: Cannot swap Slot TMP[iszero, 0] with Slot 0x06: too deep in the stack by 1 slots in [ RET _6 TMP[iszero, 0] _5 _3 _2 _4 _3 _8 _2 var_self_slot _6 _1 var_value _7 _4 _9 _8 _5 0x06 ]
memoryguard was present.
```
