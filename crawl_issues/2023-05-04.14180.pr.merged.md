# [\#14180 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14180) `merged`: Add missing overridden virtual methods in SMT Sort structs

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95899911?u=b80e228dd73aa60cc8cc18ebf2e9e72a0840b7d5&v=4" width="50">[matheusaaguiar](https://github.com/matheusaaguiar) opened issue at [2023-05-04 06:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14180):

This needs a proper issue (that still needs to be created), but briefly the lack of proper overridden functions in two structs in `libsmtutil/Sorts.h` causes a [compilation error](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29548/workflows/6aa874db-b2d8-44c3-9d90-8c0761b31b17/jobs/1312573) in archlinux.
There was a previous [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14011) to fix the issue, but it was closed.

Partially addresses https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14184

@leonardoalt can you see why the model checker tests (cmdline) are failing? Also, looks like fmtlib has an issue in `b_archlinux`:
```
/root/project/build/_deps/fmtlib-src/include/fmt/core.h:1566:15: error: possibly dangling reference to a temporary [-Werror=dangling-reference]
 1566 |   const auto& arg = arg_mapper<Context>().map(val);
```
At this point, we can either disable the warning, or see about bumping fmtlib (if this was even sorted out in the later versions).

If bumping the fmtlib version solves it, just bump it.
We should generally keep these things up to date, it's just not at all times highest priority.

The actual test failures look like incorrect assertions in the SMT code that actually relied on these comparisons being broken. Probably mostly a matter of weakening the respective assertions, but it'll ideally entail some debugging to figure out why they are broken and why that's (hopefully) fine.

My guess is that the SMT code doesn't properly account for (maybe even implicit) conversions in its sorts, hence there's some mismatches - and it actually asserts for matching sorts a lot - but those asserts were partly noops due to the broken comparisons :-).

interesting to see if tests pass
