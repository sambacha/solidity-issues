I guess lack of micro-optimization like this is what drives people to aggressively resort to inline assembly like in this case seen in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13149

Looking and thinking through the possible cases here again, this might still be problematic for this case:
```
error E(bytes32 x);
contract C {
    bytes s;
    function f() public {
        revert E(bytes32(s));
    }
}
```

since the abi encoding from storage bytes to fixed bytes may involve temporary hasing in scartch space - given that, I'll postpone merging this until after the release pending a closer look.

Ah, wait, I also need to think through the cases where the scratch space would be overwritten. So maybe not ok yet (but at least I did not notice any problems directly in the implementation).

Yeah, it's **not** fine as it stands - but I actually wanted to use this PR for a "teach how to review codegen for correctness" session, so I haven't fixed it yet - but not sure we'll have the time for it.
I'll draft it for now in any case.

> Looking and thinking through the possible cases here again, this might still be problematic for this case:

Anything involving type conversions seems safe because the conversion is performed before the revert function (at least on 0.8.20):

```yul
/// @src 0:97:98  "s"
let _1_slot := 0x00
let expr_12_slot := _1_slot
/// @src 0:89:99  "bytes32(s)"
let expr_13 := convert_bytes_to_fixedbytes_from_t_bytes_storage_to_t_bytes32(expr_12_slot)
/// @src 0:87:100  "E(bytes32(s))"
{
    let _2 := allocate_unbounded()
    mstore(_2, 8203157970705126157628513801238240545114148153221041971593256941893860720640)
    let _3 := abi_encode_tuple_t_bytes32__to_t_bytes32__fromStack(add(_2, 4) , expr_13)
    revert(_2, sub(_3, _2))
}
```

So the only problems could come from the encoding. With parameters being restricted to value types I guess this excludes any possibility of it messing with the scratch space?

It's possible that the current version is already safe since we don't have *implicit* conversion from ``bytes`` to fixed bytes and the conversion will thereby happen before the revert snipped, yes. It's safer to restrict further in any case.

Actually, I'm looking forward to doing this in-language, then we could just encode the safety of stuff like this in the type system.

Ok, maybe better to be too careful. In any case, I tried a bunch of cases but did not came up with anything that could break it. For example:
- We have implicit conversion from string literals to `bytes32` but limited to 32-byte strings so we're covered.
- I also played with calldata or storage values but to access a value type it must be in an array/slice/struct/mapping and you must use indexing or member access, which happens before encoding.
- We don't have pointers to value types so that's out too (and you'd have to artificially make it point at scratch space to mess with this mechanism anyway).
- Selectors are hashed at compilation time so not an issue either.

Just in case I rechecked which types are marked as value types in `Types.h` and the only one that looks suspicious is `InaccessibleDynamic`, but I doubt we have to worry about that one.

Looking at `ABIFunctions::tupleEncoder()` and the encoding helpers it calls, but it seems that with value types we're skipping all the cases where something weird could happen. Though to be honest, this is a sprawling set of functions and I don't know all its nook and crannies so there could always be something obscure and counterintuitive that I missed.

Yeah - that's why my plan was to screenshare on this PR and walk through what to look for and think through during such a review - maybe we'll still find time for it eventually, let's see :-). But yeah, especially with restricting to value types for the argument types as well should be safe.

We could merge a version in case there are no arguments at all.

This pull request was closed due to a lack of activity for 7 days after it was stale.

> Finally, what's the impact on external tests? I really expected there to be more of it with recent changes.

I wouldn't be surprised if it had very little impact, as I'd assume people would have been reverting small errors via assembly (which is why we even implemented this optimization).
