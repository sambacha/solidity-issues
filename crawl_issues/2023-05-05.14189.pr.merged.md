> I wasn't in the discussion about changing it, but it looks fine to me. So I'm approving ;)

It was in a previous PR, lost in ether now... ðŸ˜†

The general gist was: 
- Most of us write International English, when we have EN(UK) It just creates inconsistencies with terms spelled multiple ways across the docs.
- We don't promote for any particular reason the UK.
- We don't have any UK teammates.
- We are an international team.
