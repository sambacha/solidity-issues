@veniger just a note about the failing external tests (i.e. all the ones with `*_test_ext_*`). Please ignore them for now, since I just noticed that due to the changes in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14242 the tests are failing for external contributions due to lack of access to the github token.

The errors in the `soltests` still need to be fixed in this PR though: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29881/workflows/47cd436e-67ed-46b8-abe4-102c5f331b1d/jobs/1327332

I can take a another more detailed look, but should be good enough to merge after a rebase.
