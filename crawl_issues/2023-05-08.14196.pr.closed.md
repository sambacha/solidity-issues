This GitHub Action will:

- Automatically assign the author of a newly opened, reopened, or ready-for-review pull request to the pull request 
- Moves it to the "In Progress" column of the Focus Board. 

The workflow excludes: 
- Pull requests labeled with "external contribution :star:"
- Checks if the pull request is already on the board before moving it to avoid duplicates.
