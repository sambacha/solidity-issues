We don't have that kind of template for other types, so it wouldn't make sense to add it only for `bool`. In the same way, I don't think it would make sense to conversely add those information for all other types, without good enough reason. Furthermore, the info added is redundant (eg.: value types being copied on assignment) or not related with the types (eg.: syntax of var declaration).
I think that the info about default value is something new here, but we don't have that info for other types and I don't think that is a priority for the project now.
Because of that, I'm closing the PR, although the team welcomes your interest in contributing. 
Please, in the future, choose a reported [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues) to work on or ask the team at the matrix [channel](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im).
