# [\#14206 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14206) `closed`: Emit event declared in (non inherited) interfaces
**Labels**: `feature`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2432299?v=4" width="50">[Amxx](https://github.com/Amxx) opened issue at [2023-05-10 12:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14206):

## Abstract

Allow a library, or a contract, to emit an event declared in a interface using the following syntax
```
emit I.EventName();
```

## Motivation

Since 0.8.20, if a libraries emits an event, the contract that uses the library should include the event in its ABI

#10996 includes the following test:
```
library L {
    event e1(uint b);
}

function f() {
    emit L.e1(5);
}

contract C /* is L ? */ {
    event e1(uint indexed a);
    function g() public {
        f();
    }
}
```

However, one may want to use events from an interface rather then defining them in a library

```
interface I {
    event e1(uint b);
}

library L {
    function f() internal {
        emit I.e1(5);
    }
}

contract C {
    event e1(uint indexed a);
    function g() public {
        L.f();
    }
}
```

Unfortunatelly, this is not accepted:
```
TypeError: Member "e1" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(contract I).
|         emit I.e1(5);
|              ^^^^
```

## Backwards Compatibility

I don't see any backward compatibility issue.
