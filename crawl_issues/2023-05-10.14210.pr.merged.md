The docs builds started to fail https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/builds/20585241/ due to the drop of support for `OpenSSL<1.1.1` in urllib3 (see: https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/2168) and the fact that readthedocs uses python `3.7`  by default.

This PR adds the readthedocs settings to the repo and update the python version to `3.11` so the docs can be built again.

Now readthedocs.org has updated the docker images they use for the regular docs build runs, which means builds will work without this change.

Since we'll also now properly be receiving failure notifications for the docs builds, we can actually consider dropping the hardcoded python version from this file again.

For the record, this is the issue in which readthedocs tracked the problem and its solution:
