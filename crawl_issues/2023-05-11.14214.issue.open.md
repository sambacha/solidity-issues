## Description

### Summary:

Providing a contract name in the contract selection of the `outputSelection` field of the JSON input is outputting empty JSON fields in versions `<=0.5.8`.

Doesn't work:
```json
"outputSelection": {
  "*": {
    "Storage": ["*"]
  }
}
```

Works:
```json
"outputSelection": {
  "*": {
    "*": ["*"]
  }
}
```

### Details

I've encountered multiple issues about the `outputSelection`. 

- Initially https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13985 about the **file selection** in the output selection in `v0.6.5`.
- Recently I've come across another issue https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/issues/690 in `<=0.4.19`
  - I thought it happens because of the introduction of the `outputSelection` in that version.
  - Shouldn't be related to solc as the field wasn't introduced back then and unfortunately there was no valid field check.
  - Hence issue opened in solc-js to handle the JSON translation for earlier versions

Digging into the issue https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/issues/1017 in Sourcify, I came across this issue which affects versions `<=0.5.8` but not `>=0.5.9`. I couldn't find any related changes in this version about the `outputSelection` so I'm opening the issue.

To reproduce, here's the compiler input JSON:
```json
{
  "language": "Solidity",
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": { "enabled": true, "runs": 200 },
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "Storage": ["evm.bytecode"]
      }
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "Storage.sol": {
      "content": "pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract Storage {\n\n    uint256 number;\n\n    function store(uint256 num) public {\n        number = num;\n    }\n\n    function retrieve() public view returns (uint256){\n        return number;\n    }\n}\n"
    }
  }
}
```

This would generate the following unexpected output:
```json
{
  "contracts": {
    "Storage.sol": {
      "Storage": {
        "evm": {
          "bytecode": {
            "linkReferences": {},
            "object": "",
            "opcodes": "",
            "sourceMap": ""
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "Storage.sol": {
      "id": 0
    }
  }
}
```

Changing the `"Storage"` field in the JSON to `"*"` will lead to an expected compiler output with bytecode.

The contract is fairly simple and attached here:

## Environment

- Compiler version: affected `<=0.5.8`
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): `default`
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Both in `0.5.8+commit.23d335f2.Darwin.appleclang` downloaded with [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select). I was able to reproduce in Remix, as well as in Sourcify, which uses solc-js on Mac ARM.
- Operating system: MacOS ARM 64bit

Since we won't touch old releases, the fix for this will probably be something similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/issues/690, although we may want to come up with a nicer cross-platform way to do such input/output translations.

Right. Putting this for the record and if it is indeed a bug, maybe to be listed in bugs. 

We just went forward with the workaround of using `*` on all levels, so all fine if this should be closed.
