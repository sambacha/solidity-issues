# [\#14219 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14219) `closed`: Ensure gettext/envsubst is installed on the docker buildpack-deps images

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2023-05-12 16:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14219):

The `envsubst` command used by the `matrix_notification` script is not always present in all docker images (see: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29747/workflows/f794b73b-c603-4bf5-8c2d-5397521b4580/jobs/1321683/parallel-runs/1/steps/1-112)

This PR adds it to all Ubuntu images not only the `b_ems` that was the one missing it. Luckily, `envsubst` is already present in the MacOS images and Windows images that has `bash` as default shell.

If you want this merged, you'll need a second PR switching to those docker images by hash in ``.circleci/config.yml``

Yes, but I got back to it today and just realized that actually it will not work in this way, since the external tests, which also uses the notification command, run on CircleCI `cimg` images, and thus will require that `gettext-base` get installed in the CI config. So I guess an alternative solution will be to detect the OS in the `matrix_notification` command and install the missing packages using the proper package manager of the OS in question. The problem would be to do that for windows, which I'm not sure if there is a easy way to do it in the CI. But as the MacOS and Windows machines already have it installed, we could just ignore it now, and make the script to install the missing package for GNU/Linux distros.

So, for now, I think we can close this and I can do a new PR with the alternative solution.
