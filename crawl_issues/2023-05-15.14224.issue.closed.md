## Page

(https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/assembly.html#memory-management)

## Abstract

The warning in the section i've linked above does not seem to be valid. Statically-sized memory arrays seem to have a length field when I test it in Remix. Images for reference:

The documentation is talking about the low-level representation in memory, not about high-level language members here. The docs are still accurate in that regard: static arrays don't store their length in memory, but might in the future.
