Copied from matrix for the record:

I'm just noticing, though, that stack-to-memory won't have run on the latest case you posted in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14187#issuecomment-1547998779, since the Yul code didn't contain a ``memoryguard`` - in that situation we expect a lot more stack-too-deep cases compared to the cases with ``memoryguard``.

So it might help to prefix the cases with ``pop(memoryguard(<random 32-bit value>))`` - that way stack-to-memory is run and we expect much fewer stack-too-deep errors (ideally none, but we're not there yet).
The memoryguard will make it harder to check for semantic equivalence, since code will only remain semantically the same, if it only accesses memory above the return value of the ``memoryguard``, but since we're only looking for stack-too-deep error, semantic equivalence between optimized and non-optimized code shouldn't be a huge problem, right?

Thank you! I addressed this issue by lowering the upper bound on memory accesses that the fuzzer generates and adding a `pop(memoryguard(upperbound))` so that we can both preserve semantic equivalence (since the fuzzer respects bound) and detect stack-too-deep.
