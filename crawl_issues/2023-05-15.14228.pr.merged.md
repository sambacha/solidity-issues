# [\#14228 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14228) `merged`: Add sudo to buildpack-deps images
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

Some images lack the `sudo` command. This PR adds it to all builder images so they are compatible with the `cimg` images provided by CircleCI: https://circleci.com/docs/circleci-images/#pre-installed-tools

`sudo` is required to fix the installation of `envsubst` in the `matrix_notification` command mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14219#issue-1707892328, since this command is used by many different jobs with different base images (i.e. the builder images and the CircleCI `cimg`) which may or may not have `sudo`. Thus, installing without `sudo` works for the builder images but not for the `cimg`, failing with `permission denied`, while the opposite fails with `command not found` for the builder images but works for the `cimg` (which is the scenario that this PR fixes).

I will open another PR switching the docker images in the CI and fixing this issue https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29747/workflows/f794b73b-c603-4bf5-8c2d-5397521b4580/jobs/1321683/parallel-runs/1/steps/1-112

I don't exactly follow what your doing here to be honest :-D.
If we need sudo in these images to install new packages, then why don't we instead just add those packages to the images :-)? I guess the reason is that you want the same series of commands to work everywhere and we run some of the jobs that are supposed to run them in other docker images we don't control? Can we just switch the docker image for those to one we control instead or is that a problem?

Ah, yeah, you explained it above, sorry...
Can we just merely conditionally install the respective package if ``gettext/envsubst`` is missing and just add it to the docker images apart from that (and to the archlinux ``pacman`` command)?

``apt-get update`` and such produces a lot of traffic in the runs, would be better to avoid having to...

We could also just replace the `envsubst` by some `sed`s :-).

Because the `cimg` also need the same package (i.e. `gettext`) so we would need to install it in the CI config, as the command is used by both types of images (our buildpack and the circleci convenience images).

> I guess the reason is that you want the same series of commands to work everywhere and we run some of the jobs that are supposed to run them in other docker images we don't control?

Yes. This is one of the reason. But mainly what I said above.

We cannot simply switch them. Well we could, but if you look at the external tests, each test may depend of different nodejs versions, which would require us to handle the setup of the nodejs in the CI instead of use the CircleCI convenience images.

Yeah, ok, fair enough :-). If you think this is the easiest way to fix this, let's just do it like that :-).

Yeah, but I feel that this is more hacky than the way I'm trying to do haha

Right, I guess I can remove it. But do you mean in the other PR right? Because here they are needed.

Haha yeah, this is another solution as well. The `envsubst` was suggested as a replacement for the `eval` that has its risk. But indeed, a `sed` would do the job as well and I assume it will also exists on the windows image. I can check if you prefer that option. I guess this would be the easiest solution indeed. I mean, it would be a solution that does not require to rebuild the docker images at least.

Yeah, whatever works in the end. We also fully control the inputs in all of this, so we can also just revert to ``eval`` really - but yeah, whatever's quickest to solve this, I was just wondering for a moment :-).

The `apt-get update` is actually required in the other PR as well: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29785/workflows/7391a417-d78d-4fbb-9cff-e96843f370d2/jobs/1323235 otherwise `apt` cannot correctly fetch the list of available packages.
