# [\#14229 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14229) `closed`: Ensure gettext/envsubst installed in GNU/Linux images
**Labels**: `has dependencies`

Depends on #14228 

Install missing dependence used by the `matrix_notification` script. The script started to fail in some Linux-based images that didn't have `envsubst` installed.

This PR also removes `inherit_errexit` which is not required anymore and does not seem to be supported by default in MacOS bash installation.

Note that `uname` will be available in both `macos` and `windows` (when using bash as default shell).

~TODO: I will update the `config.yml` with the new docker images as soon GH finishes to build them.~

I tested in a local fork simulating failures and it works for Linux, MacOS and Windows images, and it also fixed the current problem in the nightly builds (i.e. https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29747/workflows/f794b73b-c603-4bf5-8c2d-5397521b4580/jobs/1321683/parallel-runs/1?invite=true#step-112-3)

Well, I also think that if `envsubst` causes this much complication, we may be better off not using it. I did not expect it to be this annoying to install. I'd rather not go back to the `eval` solution but our templates are simple enough that `sed` would do the job just fine.

I'd still merge this PR though. Consistently having `sudo` in all images may come in handy later and if you went through the trouble of adding it, we may just as well keep it.

So can we merge this?

No, I will replace `envsubst` by the alternative using `sed`. Although I think that we could still consider install `sudo` in all images. But as @cameel  suggested, this should be moved to another PR anyway.
