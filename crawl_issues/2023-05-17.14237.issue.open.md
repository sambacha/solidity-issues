**Labels**: `selected for development`, `experimental`

Enable postfix typing under ``pragma experimental solidity``.

Tasks:

- [ ] Allow variable declarations of the form ``let x : Type`` and ``let x : Type = Expression`` in experimental mode:
       - Store the fact that the declaration is postfix in the VariableDeclaration AST node
       - Type checking should so far be fully unaffected.
       - Add a new section of syntax tests for experimental solidity and introduce a minimal (!) set of tests for this (proper testing we can introduce when things stabilize - we *will* get rid of most of the builtin types in experimental solidity, so it does *not* make sense to cover more than a single example case for each kind of expression).

Note: in the first step *always require a type* (that way we can leave type checking unchanged for now) and still retain parsing prefix types. Try to keep a nice separation between experimental and non-experimental modes where possible, but don't go overboard with it.

- [ ] Allow declarations of function arguments and return values as ``function f(x : a) returns (y : a)``
- [ ] Disallow parsing prefix types (i.e. ``uint x;`` will become invalid);
- [ ] always parse index-access-paths as expressions, never as types.
       - currently ``S[1][2][3];`` cannot be disambiguated between an index access to an array variable called ``S`` and an array type of a struct named ``S`` - which choice is correct is context-dependant (i.e. is it ``struct S {...}`` or ``uint[][][] S;``). With postfix typing, an expression like this can *always* directly be parsed as nested index access, since statements cannot start with types anymore.

As a subsequent step:
- [ ] Allow omitting types (plain ``let x;``) - we will only do this while or after we switch out the type checker, since the current one won't be able to deal with untyped variables.

Note: this is a task for experimental solidity, so coarse reviews, fast merging. Do the tasks step-wise and merge in small steps.
