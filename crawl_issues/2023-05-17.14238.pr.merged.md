Rearranged the calldata encoding explanations for the example functions so they are more easy to understand since they now visually match the order the functions are declared:

Foo.bar() 
Foo.baz() 
Foo.sam()

Maybe I'm smolbrain but it was confusing to reference the functions when they are declared in a different order than they are explained. I kept imagining calldata encoding layouts for bar() even though the example I was looking at discussed baz() instead.

Minor change but makes a big difference for less experienced calldataooors like me.
