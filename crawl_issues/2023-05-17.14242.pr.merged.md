# [\#14242 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14242) `merged`: Fix intermittent error in `install_foundry` command 

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2023-05-17 14:43](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14242):

The `install_foundry` command fails from time to time with the following error: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/29819/workflows/8bf56b71-d3c4-48ca-ab74-4264020b4886/jobs/1324702?invite=true#step-103-17

```
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403
```

I suspect that this is due to the fact that we are not doing authenticated request to github in this specific CI job, and consequently hitting the limit of request per hour that Github imposes on unauthenticated requests (see: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/authenticating-to-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

This PR fixes that by adding the `Authorization` header to the request to the Github API. It also adds a missing comment to the `job_ems_compile_ext_colony` as mentioned here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14234#discussion_r1196315143, which is unrelated but it is simple enough to be changed together I think.
