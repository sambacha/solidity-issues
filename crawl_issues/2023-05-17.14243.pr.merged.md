WTF, why is Github now faking my comments? :)

In any case, approval got dismissed, so I need another one.

Argh, now github is not picking up CircleCI results, [even though they all finished successfully](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/30102/workflows/68da6e28-a24d-4593-ba1b-cbe308e312eb). Rebasing just to hopefully stir things into working.
