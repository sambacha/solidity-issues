*note:* this is essentially a copy of @axic's https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10639; due to the pragma changes, it was easier to simply start over instead of rebasing the original PR.

Well, item 1 and a test for non-quoted imports not working for files will do that.

> changelog

It's experimental solidity, there's no need.

One more thing though: all the assembly blocks will need to be marked as ``assembly ("memory-safe")`` these days (in review we need to recheck if they actually are, but they should be).

Why not finish this during a few weeks by the way? This should kind of be our main focus.

Yup, the item was really a leftover from before we decided on the new import syntax

> It's experimental solidity, there's no need.

We had a discussion last week while you were off, and had the idea to introduce an experimental section in the changelog; this is of course not set in stone, but we figured that there should at least be some form of minimal communication to the users that this stuff is in fact available. In any case, we can discuss it next Wednesday.

Sure, although there's some via-ir stuff I have left over as well.
