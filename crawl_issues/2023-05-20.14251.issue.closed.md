### Description
The compiler failed to simplify ``x == y || true`` to ``true`` but it can optimize ``true || x == y`` and ``false || true``
### Environment 
Tested on Remix of compiler version 0.8.19+commit.7dd6d404
### Reproduce 
1. source code
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RandomProgram {
    function test(uint x, uint y) pure public returns(uint){
        require(x == y || true);//failed
        require(false || true);//optimized
        require(true || x == y);//optimized
        x += y;
        return x;
    }
}
```
2. compiler_config.json
```json

{
	"language": "Solidity",
	"settings": {
		"viaIR": true, 
		"optimizer": {
			"enabled": true,
			"runs": 200
		},
		"outputSelection": {
			"*": {
			"": ["ast"],
			"*": ["abi", "metadata", "devdoc", "userdoc", "storageLayout", "evm.legacyAssembly", "evm.bytecode", "evm.deployedBytecode", "evm.methodIdentifiers", "evm.gasEstimates", "evm.assembly"]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
