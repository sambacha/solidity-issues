# [\#14254 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14254) `closed`: 0.8.20 produces contract that works on Ethereum but not Arbitrum (PUSH0)
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

When compiled using 0.8.19, this works fine.

When compiled using 0.8.20, the contract deploys but is non-functional.

See:  https://arbiscan.io/address/0x504ada2360ac822faf7ac703b350fadc8d931211#code

In File 16, you'll see for example:  `bool public constant isRECustodian = true;`, but if you click the `Read Contract` tab you'll see that it returns `false` (or rather, it returns nothing at all and Arbiscan just shows `false`).  This is similarly true with all the other values

When reading `amountRecovered` using a dummy parameter like `0x1234567812345678123456781234567812345678`, we see this:  `Error: Returned error: invalid opcode: PUSH0`

I note that using `push0` was a new feature in 0.8.20

Perhaps it's "not a bug, it's Arbitrum's problem for not supporting push0".  But it would be helpful to know how to disable `push0` generation, if that's the case.  And it's probably worth some documentation.  It's a confusing trap to fall into.

I did just find a reference: https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support

I had this issue today as well. I see this project follows Semantic Versioning. To me updating the `patch` number should not introduce breaking changes. On the other side [semver](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4) says:

> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.

Is this the reason why 0.8.20 breaks the compatibility with 0.8.19? This would help me assess and understand how and when I should update to a new patch version of Solidity.

To be fair, this is the solidity repo for github username `ethereum`, not `everychain` hehe

But yeah.  Was a gotcha.
