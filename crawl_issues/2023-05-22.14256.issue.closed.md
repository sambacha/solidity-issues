## Description

Developer would like to know if duplicate `@param` entries are given.

## Environment

solc-0.8.20

## Steps to reproduce

```solidity
contract c {
	/// @param f asdad
	/// @param f bar
	struct s {
		uint32 f;
	}
}
```

Compile this: no errors/warnings

Note: solang says:

```
warning: duplicate tag '@param' for 'f'
  ┌─ /home/sean/git/solang/f.sol:3:6
  │
2 │     /// @param f asdad
  │         -------------- previous tag '@param' for 'f'
3 │     /// @param f bar
  │         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Decision: For now, we have decided to go with a Warning instead of throwing out an error.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
