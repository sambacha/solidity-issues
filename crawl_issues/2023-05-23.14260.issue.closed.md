**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`, `feature`

## Abstract

Currently, the Natspec tag `@inheritdoc` is only valid for `functions` and `public` state variables.

Solidity does not allow to compile if a `constructor` contains an `@inheritdoc` Natspec tag. See below.

## Motivation

This would be useful to not have to copy-paste the Natspec comments from the Parent contract `constructor` into the child contract `constructor` for behaviour inherited from `constructor`.

For instance in the example above, I have to write twice the Natspec tag `@dev Emits a `ValueReceived` event when funding the contract on deployment.`, although this is already present in the Natspec of the `constructor` of the parent contract.

@AnuragNishad12 

Basically if a contract inherits another contract that has a `constructor` with some Natspec in it, the Natspec in the `constructor` of the parent contract are lost unless you copy-paste them in the child contract.

In the example above, the `constructor(...)` of `UniversalProfile` also runs the `constructor` of the inherited contract `LSP0ERC725Account`.
The `constructor` of `LSP0ERC725Account` contains some Natspec, but it is not parsed, unless I copy-paste and port over all the Natspec from `LSP0ERC725Account -> constructor` to `UniversalProfile -> constructor`.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
