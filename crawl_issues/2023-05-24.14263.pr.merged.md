# [\#14263 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14263) `merged`: Prefer authenticated request to github api when the token is available

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2023-05-24 10:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14263):

The PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14242 changed the `install_foundry` command to perform authenticated requests to the Github API when querying the foundry release SHA hash, since unauthenticated requests have a lower limit of requests per hour, which was causing intermittent failures.

However, external contributors do not have access to the GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable set in the CircleCI project settings, and thus fail to perform the authenticated request to the Github API:

This PR changes the previous behavior to only add the `Authorization` header when the GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN is available.
