# [\#14265 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14265) `closed`: Make `--no-optimize-yul` disable `optimizeStackAllocation`
**Labels**: `optimizer`

A fix for a small bug I noticed while restoring `--no-optimize-yul` option for #14243.

On the CLI `--no-optimize-yul` does not disable `OptimiserSettings::optimizeStackAllocation` while `settings.optimizer.details.yul: false` in Standard JSON does: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/4a1dbdaedb652ea649a4238038354f26486693bc/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L598

This is technically a breaking change but I think we should treat it as a bugfix - these two options clearly should be equivalent.

After getting feedback from @ekpyron, I'm going to close this because this change is not needed. At least not as a standalone PR visible in the changelog.

He pointed out that this should be making via-IR equivalence tests fail in #14265 where we remove double Yul optimization, but it does not. Turns out that it's because stack optimization setting is ignored in that PR. It's now on top of #14149, which makes it impossible to disable `optimizeStackAllocation` if the user does not request Yul optimizer to be enabled at the same time.

So the bottom line is that this change still makes sense in isolation but it would have an effect on `--no-optimize-yul` only for a very short time until we merge #14149.

It would still have an effect on `--optimize-yul` but only after #14268 (currently `--optimize-yul` is a no-op). If that's the only thing we're getting out of this PR, I guess it's better to close it and move that bit to the PR that is affected by it.
