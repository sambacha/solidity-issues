Another bugfix from my work on restoring `--no-optimize-yul` option for #14243.

Apparently we allow users to specify both `--optimize-yul` and `--no-optimize-yul` at the same time. Since `--optimize-yul` is a no-op, this combination is equivalent to just `--no-optimize-yul`.

Now that I'm making these options work for assembly, I could just carry over this idiosyncrasy, but it does not feel right. We should really just disallow this combination.

Technically breaking but I'd consider compiler not rejecting any nonsensical option combination a bug.

Because that was originally a part of my upcoming PR where I enable `--optimize-yul` and `--no-optimize-yul` for strict assembly. So this case will actually be just as relevant soon.
