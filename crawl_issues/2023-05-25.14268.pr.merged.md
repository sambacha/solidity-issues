# [\#14268 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14268) `merged`: Resurrect Yul optimizer CLI options
**Labels**: `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-05-25 09:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14268):

Part of #14149.
Prerequisite for #14243.

It wasn't possible to disable Yul optimizer when assembling on the CLI. Without it we're forced to run it twice when doing two-step via-IR compilation (i.e. `.sol` -> `.yul` + `.yul` -> bytecode instead of `.sol` -> bytecode).

It was already possible via Standard JSON, but we should have it on the CLI as well. For example in #14243 it is much easier to update our via-IR equivalence tests if we can keep running them via the CLI.

For consistency the PR also makes the `--optimize-yul` flag work. Until now it was a no-op, even though it's not like it makes no sense. You can do
```json
"optimizer": {"enabled": false, "details": {"yul": true}}
```
via Standard JSON just fine. Now the `--optimize-yul` flag is equivalent to that.

In general the PR looks totally good. But I did a small test. You wrote that `"optimizer": {"enabled": false, "details": {"yul": true}}` is the same as using `--optimize-yul`, and I exactly wanted to check this. But I seem to get different byte code for that - I don't have an explanation at least right now.

But maybe you know:

I used `semanticTests/interfaceID/homer.sol` as a test.

The only other thing I was thinking is that this `--ir` and `--ir-optimized` is a bit confusing. Why we don't only have `--ir` and this will just take `--optimize-yul` and `--no-optimize-yul` into account? I know that this might be a different topic.

@aarlt
> But I seem to get different byte code for that - I don't have an explanation at least right now.

Looks like it's the difference in the value of `optimizeStackAllocation` between Standard JSON and CLI. On the CLI it's enabled by the `--optimize` flag and `--optimize-yul` alone does not affect it. In Standard JSON, on the other hand, it depends on the value of `optimizer.details.yul`.

So yeah, `--optimize-yul` right now is actually equivalent to this:
```json
"optimizer": {"enabled": false, "details": {"yul": true, "yulDetails": {"stackAllocation": true}}}
```

I already have a PR to fix that though: #14265.

You should just use the `--asm`/`evm.assembly` output for diffing. You would not have to use disassembler and metadata would not get interpreted as code.

Well, what can I say... We had #13801 but it got closed as stale and apparently @ekpyron did not think it's worth reopening.

This inconsistencies in the context CLI vs. standard json will be gone once we always use standard json internally for the CLI, right? I was thinking that it could make sense to add a test-script that is somehow comparing the CLI vs. standard json output for same parameters. However, if the CLI is just using standard json, I guess we don't need this.

It's already properly organized into atomic commits. There's nothing to squash.

Well, it should be gone, though technically you could still map CLI options to Standard JSON in a wrong way. Having a way to test this kind of thing does make sense. Also, the CLI rewrite is not on the immediate roadmap so who knows when it will eventually happen.

Incidentally, I have a bit of left-over code from my attempt to do viaIR equivalence test via Standard JSON. I just tried to use that to create such a comparison and it turned out to be quite easy. I'm going to submit it in a separate PR, though because I don't want it to block this PR. It's just nice to have, not something we absolutely need.

Ah ok, I think I almost always squashed so far all my PRs to just one commit. Maybe I should also just create multiple atomic commits.

True.

Yeah, its really great that you created that comparison PR, it makes definitely sense to have that!
