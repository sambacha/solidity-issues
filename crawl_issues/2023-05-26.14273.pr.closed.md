 The unused jumpdest remover is always off if no details are given 
and by default it is false

Hi @AnuragNishad12 and thanks for contributing. As it turns out, the jumpdest remover is for all intents and purposes on by default, so the docs are in fact correct; see [this comment thread](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14272#discussion_r1206538102). I'll therefore be closing this PR.
