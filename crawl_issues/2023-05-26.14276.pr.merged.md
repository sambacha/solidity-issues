# [\#14276 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14276) `merged`: SMTChecker: External function call with struct member is not getter

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2023-05-26 12:20](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14276):

if a struct has a member that is a function pointer with `external` attribute, and such a member is called, it is currently incorrectly treated as a public getter in SMTEncoder.

The proposed fix is to make SMTEncoder::publicGetter more strict in deciding whether an expression is a public getter. The added condition, that the access happens on a state variable, is exactly what is checked later with an assertion that is currently failing.

Fixes #14182.
