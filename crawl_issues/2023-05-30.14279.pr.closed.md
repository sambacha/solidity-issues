`cvc5` has been released more than a year ago and which should use it instead of `CVC4`.
This PR makes the necessary changes in our interface class and updates the references in the codebase, including CMake and documentation.
Most changes are cosmetic, but there are some that need to be tested.
We need some tests in CI that would exercise the interface with cvc5 in our BMC engine. 
I believe that at the moment, there are none.

Fixes #13843.

I think we can close this PR since we're going to do https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14325 instead.
