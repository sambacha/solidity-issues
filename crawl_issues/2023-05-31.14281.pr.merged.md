## Description

According to [2d5142adfcc33148b9208083c09e21547a044abd](https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-community/commit/2d5142adfcc33148b9208083c09e21547a044abd), `solidity` official package was removed. This changes Solidity's documentation to reference the two packages added in Arch User Repository (AUR), [solidity](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/solidity) and [solidity-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/solidity-bin).

Hum...I wonder why it was removed, is that related to the [Archlinux git migration](https://archlinux.org/news/git-migration-announcement/)? Because now the `community` repository was merged into `extra`. So maybe `solidity` was supposed to be moved there as well but it was not?

I doubt it was just forgotten. It was one of the Arch Linux devs who submitted it to AUR. I tried to find something on the mailing lists, but I see no mentions of it though.

In the end, packages get moved between AUR and official repos all the time. Maybe they just did not think maintaining it was worth it. After all, pretty much all frameworks just download binaries from solc-bin because you usually need a specific version. On a rolling release distro like Arch you only get the latest version packaged. I do use that package for the convenience of having a global `solc` binary always at hand, but I doubt it's seeing that much production use by people who actually develop contracts on Arch.

The package was removed as part of the 23 spring cleanup, meaning it was orphaned on the `community` repo, and since no one wanted to maintain it, it was moved to the AUR. Hope this clarifies it :+1:

Thanks @FFY00, yes it does ;)

@alexjorgef thanks for your contribution, but I think this comment https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14281#discussion_r1211509191 should be addressed before we merge this PR. I.e. we need to be clear that the `solidity` package is not available on Archlinux but it is possible to install it using the community-driven repository (maybe adding a link to the AUR documentation), and users should be aware of the risks in doing it.

Thanks @FFY00 for clarifying the information. It appears that Arch is making enhancements to their delivery system, enabling a stronger and more automated approach for users to contribute. Hopefully, we will see official package reinstated.

Yes, the svn to git migration has been a long time coming. It was a very big undertaking as the whole team are just volunteers, unlike the majority of the other major distributions, and the whole repository infrastructure was built on to of svn and had to be [rewritten from scratch](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/repod), which is also what enabled the `[extra]`-`[community]` merge.

LGTM. @alexjorgef could you please squash the commits and rebase it? Then I think we can merge it ;)
