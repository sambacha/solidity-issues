Fixes #10299

Suggested fix for the issue - added `validateAddress()` function and related tests.  The function was added to **new** `Address.h/cpp` as I did find an existing header file where to add the new function.

The new function includes the checksum check, which is new for JSON input.  Hopefully this will not cause compile errors for existing files. 

(Sorry for the two redundant commits, as I was not aware about `check_style.sh` and its required use.)

>I think that `libsolutil/CommonData.h/cpp` would be a good place, since we also have `passesAddressChecksum` there, for example.

There is a problem with this approach that **I am not sure how to fix**. `h160` is defined in `FixedHash.h`.  However, including `FixedHash.h` in `CommonData.h` causes issues as the one below.  I assume this is because `FixedHash.h` is including `CommonDat.h`, so there is some kind of cyclic definitions.

@davidBar-On , I hadn't noticed that cyclic dependency. In that case, I think that your approach, adding `Address.h/cpp`, might be the best here. Can you squash the commits and rebase on develop, please?

Although it may be redundant, this https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10299#issuecomment-874826732 in the issue pointed out that:

> CLI checks if the address is empty but Standard JSON does not. This check is redundant because we still check address length later but if it's there, it should be in both places.

So we should add a test for empty address in the Standard JSON as well.

By the way, thanks a lot for the contribution @davidBar-On, but to let you know, as the change in this PR is a breaking change we may not merge it right now into the develop branch. Please see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10299#issuecomment-874837684 for context.

We still need to update our `breaking` branch with the latest develop and decide on what will be included in the next breaking release of the compiler, and this may take some time.

As also stated in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14520#issuecomment-1698962069, unfortunately, we cannot simply *hope* that this won't affect any existing json input - this is a breaking change, so we need to treat it accordingly. Our ``breaking`` branch unfortunately is currently unmaintained and will need some work to make it feasible again to be targetted, so I'll close this PR for the time being. We can revisit when we revive the breaking branch.
