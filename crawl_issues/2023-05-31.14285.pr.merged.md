> It should match whatever we do for Yul since there we also have only one contract per file. If it's "" there then here it's fine too, but please check.

I just checked, the output is defined by the object name, that we don't have in the evm assembly.

input:
```
{
	"language": "Yul",
	"sources": {
		"A": {
			"content": "object \"a\" { code { let addr := linkersymbol(\"contract/test\\\".sol:L\") sstore(0, addr) } }"
		}
	},
	...
}
```

output:
```

    "contracts":
    {
        "A":
        {
            "a":
            {
            }
        }
    }
```

So I guess its ok to just have the empty name here.
