Mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14268#issuecomment-1571037857.
~Depends on #14268.~ Merged.

We don't really have any tests checking whether CLI options properly map to Standard JSON settings. Even in a PR like #14268 I basically assumed that they match, but did not really check because it's quite tedious. In this particular case turned out to be not exactly true (it was off due to the difference in `stackAllocation` handling), as pointed out by @aarlt.

I actually already modified `cmdlineTests.sh` for #14243 to be able to compile via Standard JSON, and that's the main thing needed to have such a test. In the end I did not include that in the PR because it turned out to be easier to do viaIR comparison via the CLI, but we could still use it for a CLI vs Standard JSON comparison.
