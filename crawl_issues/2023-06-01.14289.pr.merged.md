**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Originally meant to be a prerequisite for #12897.

I'm constantly annoyed by the fact that while working on via-IR equivalence tests I cannot run just those tests alone. Each time I have to manually comment out large bits of `cmdlineTests.sh`, which causes conflicts when I have to rebase. This time I got annoyed enough that I decided to resurrect a small refactor that I originally started for #12897 but never had time to finish.

The idea is simple: make it possible to define a test that just runs a shell script stored in the test dir. Then move all the hard-coded test code from `cmdlineTests.sh` into such a tests. 

This is meant to be a very simple mechanism because `cmdlineTests.sh` should eventually be rewritten in Python anyway. For example I intentionally did not add any special logic for ordering tests, even though I wanted to have these scripts still run at the end. I simply used names starting with `~` which puts them after all other tests in the sort order.

This finally makes is possible to do something like `test/cmdlineTests.sh "~via_ir_equivalence"` and run only that single test. Also, selecting some other tests finally makes the script finish without always running those lengthy scripts (which I most of the time just end up interrupting with Ctrl+C).

I recommend reviewing individual commits because there's not that much actual change here, even though it may not be apparent from the combined diff. Most of the diff comes from the commit moving bits of code out of `cmdlineTests.sh` (intentionally with as few changes as possible to make the commit easy to review) and another removing some unnecessary subshells, which just changes indents and should reduce to a bunch of parenthesis removals if you enable the option to ignore whitespace changes in the diff.

Done. I actually ended up describing how the CLI tests work in general so I'm putting it in a separate PR: #14292. I'd like to merge this one already and we can review these docs separately.
