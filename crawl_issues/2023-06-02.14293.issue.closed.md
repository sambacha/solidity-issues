Solidity version 0.8.19

## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/smtchecker.html and https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/smtchecker.html#smtchecker-options

## Abstract

I want to see the SMTLib2 file that is being generated for a contract (see below). I see that there is a command line flag for this, --model-checker-solvers=smtlib2, but when I use that option nothing is generated. 

Thanks for your help.

So it looks like in the solc-js project you can see a temporary smtlib2 file [being written](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/master/smtsolver.ts#LL39C13-L39C13). I really just need this file to persist. 

Any ideas?

@cvick32 currently it's possible but it's tricky. There's a PR adding that and it will be available in the next release.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
