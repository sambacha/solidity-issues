Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13137
Based on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13137#issuecomment-1338051885
Builds upon https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13196

Adds two additional clauses to the member access type checker to ensure that `annotation.isPure` is set to true when:
- expression is a non-anonymous event, member name is "selector" 
- expression is an error, member name is "selector" 

With these changes, the following code becomes valid:

```solidity
contract C {
    event Ev();
    error Er();
    function f() external {}

    bytes4 constant functionSelector = this.f.selector;  // OK
    bytes4 constant errorSelector = Er.selector;         // OK, previously error
    bytes32 constant eventSelector = Ev.selector;        // OK, previously error
}
```
