It would be best to link to the original PR in the description (#14116) and say something about what happened here :) Otherwise it will be very confusing for anyone who looks at these two identical PRs later.

So basically @pgebal thought he was doing squash and merge and edited the merge commit description while it was in fact a normal merge. I moved `develop` back to the state from before the merge and now this PR is merging that code again.

In the end we agreed to just edit the description of the original merge commit so this PR is not needed. I see that github still counts it as merged though. Well, both PRs contain the same exact code so no problem.
