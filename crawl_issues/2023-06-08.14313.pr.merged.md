When using solidity as a third-party library (include it into our project using FetchContent), we encountered a strange compilation error. For some reason, cmake considers the root directory of the project as the root directory of the dependency (solidity). This is because solidity is incorrectly using CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR variable, which should be PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR (The former one refers to the top-level source directory that contains a CMakeLists.txt, while the latter refers to the source directory of the most recent project() command)

I've created a repo for demonstration (https://github.com/junaire/test-solidity-fetch-content)

Hi @junaire I see no problem in merging it, but I will tag @ekpyron and @cameel so they can also have a look at it :)
