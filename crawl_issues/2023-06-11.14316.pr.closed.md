Fixes #12783 
Fixes  #3446

Suggested fix for issuing an an error message instead of assert when trying to copy non-storage struct array to storage.

The added tests for the push cases are split into several files, since if there are more then one such errors in a file, only the first error is shown.

There are some `semanticTests/array/copying/` **existing tests that fail** because of the change from the assert to the compilation error. Should these failed tests be moved from `sematicTests` to `syntaxTests`?

Unfortunately, this is the wrong implementation (Via-IR in these operations work).

@NunoFilipeSantos, I will appreciate it if you can briefly clarify why this is a wrong implementation and what do you mean by "Via-IR in these operations work"? Thanks.

I tried testing the new test files with the `--via-ir` option and without it, and I get the same results in both cases.
