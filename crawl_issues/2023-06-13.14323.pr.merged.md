# [\#14323 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14323) `merged`: Disallow `--stop-after parsing` with CLI outputs that require analysis

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-06-13 14:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14323):

I found a small bug while testing my solution for #14305.

Looks like all CLI outputs except for `--ast-compact-json` require analysis (they even have checks against that in `CompilerStack`) and will crash when used with `--stop-after parsing. This PR properly blocks them.

```bash
echo 'contract C {}' | solc - --stop-after parsing --abi
```
```
======= /tmp/test.sol:C =======
Uncaught exception:
/solidity/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp(972): Throw in function const Json::Value& solidity::frontend::CompilerStack::contractABI(const std::string&) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::CompilerError>
std::exception::what: Analysis was not successful.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Analysis was not successful.
```
