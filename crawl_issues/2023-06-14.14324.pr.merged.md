He already did, no?

I guess he meant on Solidity repo. But we don't need to. The one in the OZ is sufficient and I already added the comment in the external test script.

Just to be clear, the OZ helpers fail when the `via-ir` flag is turned on because hardhat does not recognize the custom errors when this flag is on. I would argue its hardhat the should fix their stuff !

We are just parsing string to try and detect if the custom error we defined were emitted correctly. How is OZ responsable if the custom error was emitted but the tooling doesn't reflect taht in the error string ?

Definitely, the major issue is on Hardhat error heuristics with via IR, not on the OZ side :)
