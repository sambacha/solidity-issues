Currently `cmdlineTests.sh` replaces compiler version in metadata in ordinary CLI tests but not in ones producing Standard JSON output. I need such a test in my upcoming PRs so I decided to fix this.

Weird. It seems to crash soltest on macOS even though the only thing it touches are the command-line tests, which it does not even run.
