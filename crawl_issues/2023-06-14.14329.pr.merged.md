# [\#14329 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14329) `merged`: Remove AST output in error recovery mode

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-06-14 14:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14329):

Replaces #14305.
~Depends on #14328.~ Merged.

This PR reverts the feature added in #6856 to simplify the logic and prevent bugs like the one #14328 fixes from reappearing in the future.

The current logic for setting the state in `CompilerStack` and deciding whether there was an error is too complex. It's also buggy, because the `m_hasError` is not reliably set on errors (the original PR did not account for early returns from the analysis). The PR changes it back to a set of simple states, which always indicate the success for the corresponding stage, without any additional flags.

No, the error recovery mode is experimental.

Ideally, we merge this together in the same release with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14395 (which would get a changelog entry just like adding the mode got)

I'll try to get to #14395 as soon as possible, but I'd prefer to get this one merged already. The PR for Natspec test case that I'm currently working on is actually happens to deal with the analysis success/errors and is much nicer if I don't have to work around this hacky error handling so I have it rebased on this PR. Otherwise I'd have to drop what I'm doing and switch to #14395 right now. I mean, I can do that, but this does not really match the priorities we have on the focus board.
