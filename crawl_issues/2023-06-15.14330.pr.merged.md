**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `testing :hammer:`

In #13583 I'll be adding additional bytecode report runs, which will double the amount of work. Those jobs are already slow enough, and the Windows one actually got almost 2.5 times slower since last year (WTF, why?).

This PR makes CI generate Standard JSON and CLI reports in parallel. This halves the running time of all or them except `b_bytecode_ems` (which does not have CLI).

This addresses #13056 in a minimal way. Not sure if going all the way to split these tests into fine-grained batches is even worth it. This minimal version is already a big improvement with very little effort. In my upcoming PR I'm going to split it once more, into optimized and non-optimized report, which should halve the times again.d I think this will be enough for now.

The slowdown of Windows machines is really odd. That's why our CI now takes ~1h again, even though last year we managed to bring it down to ~30 min. In wonder if this is something like the [change for macOS where they removed the `large` resource class and made it equivalent to `medium` machine instead](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/macos-resource-deprecation-update/46891).

Another oddity is the time difference between `b_bytecode_ubu_static` and `b_bytecode_ubu` but it's probably because `b_ubu` is a `Debug` build.

> I read through [this](https://circleci.com/docs/test-splitting-tutorial/), which is what you've also done I'm assuming (or at least something similar)

Yes, exactly. `parallelize: N` splits the job into N parallel containers, each running the same exact configuration. Then you can run `circleci tests split` command giving it a list of items and it will return a different subset in each container through CircleCI magic. So in this case I have just 2 items (`cli` and `standard-json`) and 2 containers. Each one will pick one interface, generate the corresponding report and put it in the workspace.

The `t_bytecode_compare` job depends on all the report generation jobs and therefore the workspace it sees consists of merged workspaces of all those jobs. It starts when they all finish successfully and will be able to access all the reports in the workspace and compare them.
