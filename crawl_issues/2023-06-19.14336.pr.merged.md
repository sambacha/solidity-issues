**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This key does not seem to be used for anything anymore. The only reference to it I found is this comment in an old PR: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2110#issuecomment-293461561. It seems that we used to use the key in `storebytecode.sh` and it was for Travis [but it stopped being used when we switched to CircleCI](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/9726ed8586fb14ef17eda86d8d26fae06ff63e51#diff-f460f95efa76f1adb09c10339a17f5b694309bacf0823c5a416cf751318133a4). I think we can safely delete it at this point.
