# [\#14338 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14338) `merged`: Add `--exclude` option to `cmdlineTests.sh`
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This is a prerequisite for an upcoming PR that will parallelize CLI tests.

This will allow me make the CI logic to support that parallelization slightly less complicated, and also I often find myself wishing we had this option when running tests locally - now it will be possible to do something like `cmdlineTests.sh --exclude '~*'` without manually constructing a `find` command.
