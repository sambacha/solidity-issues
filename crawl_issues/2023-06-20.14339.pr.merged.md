# [\#14339 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14339) `merged`: Parallelize CLI tests
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This PR takes advantage of the recent improvements to the CLI test runner (#14289, #14338) to single out several particularly long CLI tests and run them in parallel. This makes the `_cli` jobs finish 2x faster.

Bigger savings are possible, but with a lot more effort to make test selection more granular. Especially `~ast_import_export` takes half of the running time and is currently a single test. Once we have better granularity we could also use CircleCI's time-based splitting, but that requires further changes - we'd need to generate JUnit-style XML reports. I'm not doing all that here. The goal of this PR is just to pick the low-hanging fruit while parallelizing the bytecode comparison tests (#14330) to prevent the byte comparison jobs from taking excessively long time in CI after #13583.
