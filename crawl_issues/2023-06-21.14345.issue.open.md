## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

put on a test to make the SMTChecker formal proof verification the contracts recursively and it can't last for more than 200+ without **Solc error,** or the compiler hanging, on FAST hardware,

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.19 - last
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): any
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): plain solc
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: any
- Operating system: any

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
``` 
-->

Check more than 200+ contracts with SMTChecker (using Z3) recursively without hanging fast hardware, or outputting error. Actually outputting the checker logs
