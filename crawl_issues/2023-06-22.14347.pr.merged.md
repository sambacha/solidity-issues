@cameel , I added the test cases you suggested.

Well, something like this obviously won't work when used with `abi.decode()`, not sure it makes sense to test it:

```solidity
abi.decode("", ((true ? addmod : addmod)(1, 2, 3)));
```

I posted these cases here because I thought you were going to include fixes for all the other broken cases in this PR (I specifically asked about this on the chat). Looks like it's not the case, and you'll be splitting it into more PRs - which is perfectly fine, but then you should include these in the PRs that will be fixing them, not here. Only the ones actually relevant to `abi.decode()` should be here.

Ah, it all makes sense now. I misunderstood when you asked about all the new cases. Now I see what you actually meant.
I read it as all the new cases `for abi.decode`, but it was `in your PR for abi.decode`. Sorry about that :) 

I will remove that test. I guess the `runtimeCode` one too, right?

Yeah. Only the cases with types make sense here.

> Just a few minor things remaining. Now the test coverage seems adequate.

Done.

> But we need a changelog entry and a bug list entry. What's the plan here? Will this be done here, done in #14371 or done separately?

I added a changelog entry in 14371 that should cover both PRs. I think the bug list entry could go there too.

Needs rebase.
