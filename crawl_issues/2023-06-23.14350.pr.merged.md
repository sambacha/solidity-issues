**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Prerequisite for #13583.

Currently the bytecode report generation is hard-coded to output results of unoptimized and then optimized compilation. This PR organizes these these settings into distinct presets and adds command-line flags for selecting an arbitrary subset of those presets.

In subsequent PRs I'll use this mechanism to add via IR presets. This PR is a pure refactor that does not change behavior and preserves the default behavior of the scripts (since they're also used for PR checks in solc-bin).

The mechanism will also later be used to generate reports for all presets in parallel in CI.

Note that there are many whitespace-only changes in the JS script. I recommend turning on the mode that ignores whitespace changes.
