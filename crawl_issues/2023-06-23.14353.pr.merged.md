# [\#14353 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14353) `merged`: Unify and simplify bytecode report generation in CI
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This is another prerequisite for #13583.

The PR merges the existing `storebytecode.sh` script (of which only the JS part was still in use) with the parallel report generation I added in #14330. Then it extracts the report comparison logic into a script as well. They're both no longer a bunch of one-liners and are better off as scripts. I will need to complicate them even more in upcoming PRs to support the presets I'm adding in #14350.

Just like #14350 this is a refactor and does not change behavior other than in trivial ways, like slightly altering the console output.
