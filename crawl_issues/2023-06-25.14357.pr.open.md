Fixes #11889 

Suggested fix for preventing error about overriding private functions by inheriting/other contracts.  The fix is based on the previous suggested fix by PR #13328, with the enhancements required by @ekpyron in that PR to make sure during code generation that private functions are not used by other contracts.  For that, a new `origCallingContract` item was added to `FunctionCallAnnotation`, that points to the contract that calls the function.  This field is used to verify that a private function is called by the defining contract, instead of using `mostDerivedContract`, since in case of a contract calling internal library function that calls a library's private function, `mostDerivedContract` points to the contract and not the library.

The test cases are practically the same as suggested by in PR #13328.

I apologize for taking our time with getting back to you on this - the test coverage now indeed looks more reassuring.
It also has codegen assertions now as a safety net.
This will still need very careful review, but I think we can work towards merging it. It will definitely need a Changelog entry to start with.
