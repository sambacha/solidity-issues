Currently, when you request all outputs in Standard JSON with `"outputSelection": {"*": {"*": ["*"]}`, the `ir` and `irOptimized` outputs are not included.

This seems to be because the IR generation used to be considered experimental: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/dabecb600f35a089f0206ebecec1fd12647df62b/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L191-L196

In 0.8.13 it became a stable feature, and I think that these outputs should have been added to `*` back then.
