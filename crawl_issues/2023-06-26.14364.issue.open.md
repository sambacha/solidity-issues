This is a different approach to the problem described in #13801.

`--ir` is the output straight from the codegen without any processing applied to it, while `--ir-optimized` is that code parsed again and then passed through `YulStack`, which may or may not apply optimizations to it, but will at the very least reformat it.

After #13972 `--ir` output is no longer the same as the unoptimized IR. The unoptimized IR has some minimal transformations applied to it to prevent "Stack too deep" errors. `--ir-optimized` is what the Yul->EVM actually runs on, and is the thing that should be given to the user.

My proposal here is to remove the current `--ir` output and then rename `--ir-optimized` to `--ir`. The same should be done in Standard JSON. The change is breaking.

A downside of this approach would be that it would no longer be possible to do two step compilation via Yul and still get the `--optimize` flag in metadata (so it would not be identical to single-step optimized compilation), which is one of the possible approaches to parallelize compilation. Currently it can be achieved by requesting `--ir --optimize` (#15062) and if we removed `--ir` it would become impossible.
