# [\#14367 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14367) `merged`: Restrict mobile types of function types.

If we go for this, this will require a changelog entry. It's also inter-related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14366

This solution is technically breaking - but the expressions in question should never occur and they're mostly broken.

We should double-check whether this has any unintended side-effects, though (as in whether this causes any ICEs or implicitly disallows something that's actually valid).

I looked through the uses of `mobileType()` and `commonType()` and I think we should be fine. This is mostly because there's very little you can actually do with function kinds other than external and internal. You cannot assign them, compare them, use with most operators, put them in arrays, mappings, structs, use as function arguments or use them to index things. I can't really think of any case this would break.
