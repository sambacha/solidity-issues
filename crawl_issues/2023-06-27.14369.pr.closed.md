**Labels**: `stale`, `smt`, `closed-due-inactivity`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2023-06-27 10:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14369):

This is an initial draft for removing  specialized solver interfaces (Z3, CVC4) and use only SMTLIB interface for communicating with all solvers.

Things to resolve

- [x] Check tests results, some changes are suspicious
- [ ] Pull Z3's resource limit to some constexpr field (common for SMTLIB and CHCSmtLib interfaces)
- [x] What is the proper way to enable SMT callback in test framework?
- [ ] Check proper distinction between available solvers  (testing presence of executable on the PATH) and requested  solvers (from command line)  
- [ ] Enable multiple solvers in CHC engine
- [x] Fix (or remove) use of SMT in `libyul/optimiser/ReasoningBasedSimplifier`
- [ ] Fix (or remove) use of two-phase SMT solving method (most likely can be removed)
- [x] Change SMT callback to query the solvers thorugh a pipe instead of a temporary file (?)

Note, so we remeber about this:
- currently `--model-checker-print-query`  cmdline param requires `smtlib2` solver, so with current changes we'll have to clarify that in changelog
