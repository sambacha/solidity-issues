# [\#14370 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14370) `merged`: Remove ReasoningBasedSimplifier from libyul

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2023-06-27 15:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14370):

Due to a design decision to move away from a bundled SMT solver (#14325), ReasoningBasedSimplifier in its current form cannot be use any longer. This is a necessary step to allow a unified way to call solvers using only SMTLIB interface.

Since this optimization pass has always been marked as highly experimental and never turned on by default, it should be OK to remove it.

That was my bad, I forgot to delete the letter `R` from the chromosome test, after I removed `ReasoningBasedSimplifier`.

Should we add an entry to the changelog about this?

Yeah, a changelog entry would be nice, then we can merge!
