- **Motivation**: The Transpiler is designed to handle basic and essential Solidity types for one to one code (or rulling) of the given Solidity source.

- **Objectives**: The Transpiler's objective is to atend every type and structural code from Solidity to C++ in a performatic and clean syntax, these types can be sanitized by using Pre-existing or new types with the pre-fix "Safe" and including the header files in the transpiled C++ code.

- **Success Criteria**: At this instance an implementation of basic / primitive types of any proper language before going to advanced and extreme cases of rules for the transpiled code.

- **Dependencies**: Implementation of transpiled code for headers, pre-existing "Safe" primitive types and generated source-code for C++.

- **Risks and Mitigations:** No risks considered due this issue being essential.

- **Resource Allocation**: Rules and code generation will be changed to fit this criteria.
