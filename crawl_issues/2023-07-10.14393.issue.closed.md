I just noticed that our contributor greeter action did not properly label #14391 as an external PR. Looks like one of its steps fail, but the action continues and behaves as if it succeeded.

From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/actions/runs/5504473596/jobs/10030713900:

```
jq: error (at org_members.json:0): Cannot iterate over null (null)
```
