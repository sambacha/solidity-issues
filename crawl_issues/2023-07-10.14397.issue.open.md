## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

I have a contract that inherits and `interface` and its Natspec documentation. The implementation function from the interface inherits the Natspec docs from the function interface using `@inheritdoc InterfaceName`.

In addition to that, I add some custom `@dev` docs on top of the implementation function.

The problem is it does not compile depending if the `@inheritdoc InterfaceName` is placed at the top and there is a space in between the `@inheritdoc` and the `@dev` tags.


## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.19
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:

## Steps to Reproduce

Here is my interface.

```solidity
interface ITest {

    /// @notice Explain to an end user what this does
    /// @dev Explain to a developer any extra details
    /// @return Documents the return variables of a contract’s function state variable
    function test() external pure returns (bool);

}

```

This will not compile ❌ 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {ITest} from "./ITest.sol";

contract MyTest is ITest {

    /**
     * @inheritdoc ITest
     * 
     * @dev some extra details
     */
    function test() external pure override returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

This will compile ✅  (no space between `@inheritdoc` and `@dev` tag.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {ITest} from "./ITest.sol";

contract MyTest is ITest {

    /**
     * @inheritdoc ITest
     * @dev some extra details
     */
    function test() external pure override returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

This will also compile ✅ if `@inheritdoc` is placed after `@dev` tag (whether if there is a space between the `@inheritdoc` and `@dev` tag or not).

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import {ITest} from "./ITest.sol";

contract MyTest is ITest {

    /**
     * @dev some extra details
     *
     * @inheritdoc ITest
     */
    function test() external pure override returns (bool) {
        return true;
    }
}
```

Any update on this issue, this greatly effects compiling and testing.

I can confirm it's a bug. It's not so much the position of @inheritdoc as the fact that the compiler does not seem to stop at the newline when reading the name of the thing that's being inherited. This example shows it better:

```solidity
    /**
     * @inheritdoc ITest
     *  a
     *   b
     *    c @dev some extra details
     */
```
```
Error: Documentation tag @inheritdoc references inexistent contract "ITest  a   b".
```

In the error message you can see which part the compiler considers to be the interface name. It only stops at `b`.

In your repro it fails because you have a trailing space after (i.e. `* ` instead of just `*`). If you remove it, the contract will compile:
```solidity
    /**
     * @inheritdoc ITest
     *
     * @dev some extra details
     */
```
So the short-term workaround for you is to enable trimming of trailing whitespace in your editor to avoid situations like this (which is a good practice in general). But this of course will need to be fixed in the compiler too.
