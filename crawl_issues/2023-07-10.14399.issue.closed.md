*Originally reported by a user*.

In Yul the function arguments are evaluated right to left. Unfortunately, the code generated by the `FullInliner` optimizer step (`i`) does not preserve that property.

### Repro
`test.sol`:
```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public {
        assembly ("memory-safe") {
            function fun_revert() -> ret { revert(0, 0) }
            function fun_return() -> ret { return(0, 0) }
            function empty(a, b) {}

            empty(fun_return(), fun_revert())
        }
    }
}
```
```bash
solc test.sol --debug-info none --optimize --yul-optimizations "i" --ir-optimized
```

Without the inliner, the `empty(fun_return(), fun_revert())` call is not inlined and the evaluation order stays the same. This way `fun_revert()` will run first and a call to `f()` will revert.

The inliner, however, works as if `fun_return()` were to be evaluated first, which results in code that `return`s instead:

```yul
if eq(0x26121ff0, newValue)
{
    if callvalue() { revert(0, 0) }
    let headStart := 4
    let dataEnd := calldatasize()
    if slt(sub(dataEnd, headStart), 0) { revert(0, 0) }
    let usr$ret := 0
    return(usr$ret, usr$ret)
}
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: affects at least 0.8.13 and 0.8.20.

### Fix
> That's an actual issue in the inliner: it shouldn't be inlining `empty`, since its arguments are complex expressions and not mere variables... the code comment of the inliner actually spells that out and claims that the inliner won't inline that function, but apparently it does nonetheless... the good thing is that we usually run the inliner only in ssa form with split expressions, so in the default optimizer sequence, this will not become an issue (we should double-check that, but it should be fine). In a custom sequence, this can actually go wrong, though.

> we change the order of visitation, **and** prevent it from inlining when it's anything other than identifiers **and** document the dependency.
