**Note:** this is an investigation task, and should not yield any implementation in code.

In order to re-implement the mechanism for compiler output in experimental solidity, the following should be investigated:

Read through the code, looking at all of the standard JSON input and output artifacts in order to determine which dependencies they have, which annotations (e.g. types) they require. This should be documented in the form of a dependency graph.
