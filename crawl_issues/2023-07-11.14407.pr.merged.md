Once nitpick in the description is: the prerequisite is that the code is in *expression split form*, not that the expression splitter is run before it (or even immediately before it - even the default sequence has steps in between but only those that preserve expression-split form). Might be worthwhile to be clear about that.

On a quick look, the fix looks good, I mainly need to double-check the buglist entry. We should also draft a blog-post about this.

We just got a follow-up, saying that it should be "Robert Chen from OtterSec" instead.
