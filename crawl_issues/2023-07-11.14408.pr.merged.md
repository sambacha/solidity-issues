#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4415530?u=dc3db70e8fbd03f92ca81ee173d57774ce61084d&v=4" width="50">[nikola-matic](https://github.com/nikola-matic) opened issue at [2023-07-11 18:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14408):

Partially fixes: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14403

Works by providing an inclusion list of directories which will be checked for the presence of using namespace std;. Finding it in one of these directories will yield errors. The goal is to add to these inclusion directories once each has been altered to use explicit namespaces.
