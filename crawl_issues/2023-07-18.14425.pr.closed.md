Hey @CodeSandwich!

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to our docs. However, it's tricky to enforce the recommended style in the docs as it depends on user's personal preference. Even when it comes to the [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html), it's recommended for the sake of consistency and eventually up to the end user.

We intend to delegate style guide efforts in the future to a group of experts that can take proposals such as above into consideration and maintain a community-driven style guide reference that can keep evolving as newer and better conventions come up from the user community. Until then, the docs are best kept in line with the current naming style for consistency. :)

I will be closing the PR on these grounds.
