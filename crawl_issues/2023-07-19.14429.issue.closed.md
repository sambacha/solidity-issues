## Description
Recently the https://docs.soliditylang.org website (with source inside the `docs` folder of this repo) underwent a design overhaul. Now that it's live, the "versions" menu in the lower left is populated with all of the old Solidity tags, causing a much larger list than in development, which overflows vertically preventing user from being able to toggle the menu closed again. 

## Environment

_Issue unrelated to Solidity compiler_, but is present on the docs website as of version v0.8.21.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to https://docs.soliditylang.org
2. Click on RTD Version menu in bottom left:

3. Note overflow, without scroll, and inability to close menu without refresh

## Additional info

Will begin working on a patch for this today.
