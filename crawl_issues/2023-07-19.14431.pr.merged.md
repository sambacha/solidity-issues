## Description
- Adds max-height and overflow-y scroll to "other versions" menu, fixing the overflow bug that was preventing users from closing the menu once opened.

## Preview deploy
https://solidity-docs-dev--2.org.readthedocs.build/en/2/
(Built from personal fork)
I added a handful of versions to the preview above, so this can be tested by shortening the height of the window on above preview and opening the versions menu:

The "RTD" bar should now remain visible at the top to close the menu, and the rest should be scrollable.

## Related issue
