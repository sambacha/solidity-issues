I think it's because these images are linked using relative URLs. The pages under "Internals" are not directly at the root, so the URL must be wrong there.

@cameel Yeah this is what I'm seeing...

These images are located in the `docs.soliditylang.org/lang/version/_static/img/filename.ext` path, but referenced using a relative path of just `_static/img/filename.ext`. 

The bug appears to be for any page that is nested further, so the relative path is checking in `/lang/version/sub-folder/_static/img/filename.ext` which doesn't exist.

We should prepend the active location `https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/_version_/` to the image paths... this will allow it to still reference the active version. Will put up a patch for this.
