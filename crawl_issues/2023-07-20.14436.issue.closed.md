## Description

The side panel of links on the docs contain hash links that direct users to specific parts of a particular page. These links are currently not bringing the user to the correct page position.

## Environment

_Issue unrelated to Solidity compiler_, but is present on the docs website as of version v0.8.21.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to https://docs.soliditylang.org
2. Click "Solidity by Example" in left menu near top
3. Click on "Blind Auction"
4. Notice the URL now contains "#blind-auction" but the page has not scrolled to this section.
5. Click "Blind Auction" one more time
6. Notice that only now does the window scroll to the intended position.

## Additional info

Root cause is known, patch in progress
