## Description

Currently the "Edit on GitHub" button shown at the top of each docs page links to the specific version being viewed in the docs. These files are frozen/snapshotted for that version and cannot be edited.

This adds logic to alter the "Edit on GitHub" button to direct users to the `develop` branch instead of the version-specific branch. Also adds `target="_blank"` to open link in new tab.

## Preview deploy
