## Description
- Adjusts layout to allow window scrolling to properly scroll content (was previously a fixed window, and content `div` was set to `overflow-y: scroll;`
- Removes old font assets in lieu of cdnfonts import

This fixes the bug where hash links from the menu were not taking user to the proper scroll position. Links in menu will now immediately bring user to associated section of the content.
