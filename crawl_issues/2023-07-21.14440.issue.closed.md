It would be very valuable to the people who are interested in the details to add the relevant PRs to each bullet point of the release notes going forward. I was going through the `0.8.21` release notes yesterday and I wanted to specifically understand the scope of "Relax restrictions on initialization of immutable variables.". I had to search in the repo for the specific PR, but doing this for multiple bullet points will be very time-consuming.

We did have an example in the [release announcement](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2023/07/19/solidity-0.8.21-release-announcement).

I'm sorry but I strongly disagree with this decision. You make everyone's life more difficult in an environment where transparency is key. Very very disappointing...

I'm sorry you feel that way. However, this is not a priority for us.
