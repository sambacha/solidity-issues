You should also include the changes that removed `disable=fixme` from a few places where we had it on `develop`.

I couldn't find any in the develop branch. Do you have an example of where we are using `disable=fixme`? I removed it already from my PR.

I meant those in 3c5287f69d4423981b2efd8cd06ee5f5348250d7. But looks like I did not look carefully enough. Those were apparently all on your branch and not on `develop`. In that case it's fine.
