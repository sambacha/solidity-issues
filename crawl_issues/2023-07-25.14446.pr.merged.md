This PR contains two changes:

1. SMTChecker tests always keep counterexamples when updating expectations, even when the option `SMTIgnoreCex` is set to `yes`. While with this option the counterexamples are ignored when comparing test output, we still want to store the counterexamples in the test file. This at least allows the developers to manually expect the counterexample discovered by the solver.
2. We bring back counterexamples in several regression tests.  After switching the default option for `SMTIgnoreCex` from `no` to `yes` (in #13755) basically no counterexamples were checked anymore. At least for tests where the counterexample is (mostly) deterministic, we can bring back counterexample checks without making  the tests brittle.
