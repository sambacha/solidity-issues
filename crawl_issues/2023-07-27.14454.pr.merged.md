In #12310 , RedundantAssignEliminator was renamed to UnusedAssignEliminator , but the documentation wasn't updated, so I fixed it.
FYI, the current implementation is here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/29041c8101d13a5e4372e9c2b94e83a5e254d66e/libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp#L313

Also, fixed several typos.

Thank you for your contribution. I will make a small change to accommodate @cameel's comment regarding changing the docker tag to `stable` and clarifying that version tags are available in surrounding text. This is to ensure users get the latest version by default and avoid an out-of-date version.

Will commit the change and merge once all checks pass. :)
