## Abstract
Including a specific security contact in a smart contract simplifies vulnerability reporting. This helps prevent miscommunication and lets code owners control the disclosure channel. Moreover, if contracts utilize third-party libraries such as Openzeppelin, and issues appear within these libraries, the developers of these libraries can easily contact code owners to mitigate the issues.

I propose to formalize a concept that has been previously proposed in [ethereum-lists/contracts](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/contracts#tracking-new-deployments) and implemented within the Openzeppelin Wizard. This involves the utilization of the NatSpec tag `custom` and use the name "security-contact".

#### Example:

```solidity
/**
 * @title Example contract
 * @custom:security-contact security@example.com
 */
contract Example {
 ... 
}
```

The idea is to include a new section right after the [Ask for Peer Review](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.21/security-considerations.html#ask-for-peer-review), which advocates for the adoption of this security contact convention.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
