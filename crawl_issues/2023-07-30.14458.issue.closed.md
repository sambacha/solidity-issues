**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`

Consider the following contract written with solidity in remix.ethereum.org

// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;

contract Sum {

    uint public sum;
    uint private first;
    uint private second;

function setNumbers(uint a, uint b)public {

        first=a;
        second=b;
    }

    function add() public{

        sum= first+second;
    }

}

After the deploy, i have this from Metamask:

And the bytecode from remix  (Total 536 bytes)

Now, what I would like is to find the gas units used, not directly from remix or metamask but to know exactly for what it was used. 
I found out from different sources that:

Every transaction is 21000 gas.
The creation is 32000 gas.
For each non zero byte the gas units used are: N*16 (N is the number of non zero bytes)
For each zero byte : n*4 (n = number of zero bytes)
Cost of runtime bytecode which is: runtimeBytecode*200
Opcode cost for initialization code which I found thanks to remix from the debug section.


The opcodes:
![opcodes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/assets/101010744/56caefff-1f85-44dc-8dd5-cebc68d97949)

With a total of 147. (It also gives the number of deployed bytecode, 0x01f8 is 504 in decimal)


So given these costs and the bytecode the cost would be:
  21.000		          Gtransaction
  32.000		          Gcreate
    7.328		          Non zero bytes (458 * 16)
       312		         Zero bytes (78 * 4)
100.800		         Deployed Bytecode Cost (504 * 200)
       147		         Opcode cost for initialization code

161.587		         Total
161.621		         Total expected (from metamask)
(-34)

I can't seem to find the mistake, or maybe Iâ€™m missing something?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
