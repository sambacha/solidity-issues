# [\#14462 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14462) `merged`: [Docs website] Add site_url root path to images [Fixes #14435]

## Description

Adds a base path to all image references to avoid relative path issue noted in #14435. This allows us to keep using the "version" indicated in the path (as opposed to hard-coding `/en/latest/`). Nested paths such as `https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html` should no longer cause a bug with the images in the header.
