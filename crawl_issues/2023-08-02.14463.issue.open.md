External function types are represented using two stack slots, selector and address.
However, counterintuitively, the selector is right-aligned.

For consistency with the fact that high-level selectors are ``bytes4`` and thus left-aligned (and potentially for efficiency in using the selector for creating the calldata for a call), we should consider changing this, making the selector slot of function types left-aligned.

Alternatively, we can consider switching towards using the packed layout for external function pointers on stack as well.

We may only change this in the reimplementation of external function pointers in experimental solidity, though.

IMO, we should start adding a warning / an info message if we decide to proceed. This will be a somewhat subtle, but dangerous change.

Documenting the current approach will also be helpful.
It doesn't seem to be documented here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html
