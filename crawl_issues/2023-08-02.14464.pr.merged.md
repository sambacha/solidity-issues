# [\#14464 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14464) `merged`: SMTChecker: Fix inconsistency on constant condition check after a loop is unrolled

Closes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14449.

It changes semantics a bit, which I think was wrong earlier:
- we now visit the condition again in case of `while` and `for` loops after the loop was unrolled `--model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations` number of times

looks like some tests either need to be updated or modified due to nondeterminism

Looking at the failing tests in CI, looks like BMC is now creating more verification conditions...
