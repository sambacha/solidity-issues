This is a preparation for upcoming change in SMTChecker that will interact with the solvers solely using smtlib interface, i.e., using the callback for issuing queries to the solvers and reading back the answers.

That change will require using compiler with the SMT callback in SMTChecker tests. Since the class SMTCheckerTest currently cannot influece how the compiler object is constructed, it needs a way to set the callback after construction.

@cameel , here is my proposed change that would allow to set callback to `CompilerStack` after construction.

I am _not_ adding an actual use in `SMTCheckerTest` here, because it is only needed once we switch `SMTChecker` to use only smtlib interface to interact with the solvers.
