# [\#14466 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14466) `closed`: Allow for named parameters in constructors / modifiers
**Labels**: `feature`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101825630?u=95ecedbb7e7ac03015da8bb9288a9906cd5ef58b&v=4" width="50">[0xMySt1c](https://github.com/0xMySt1c) opened issue at [2023-08-03 20:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14466):

## Abstract

Currently you cannot use named parameters in modifiers or constructors, but you are able to in function calls. 
```solidity
function foo(uint256 bar, string memory baz) public {

}

function main() public {
  foo({baz: "wow", bar: 1 ether});
}
```

## Motivation

The ability to explicitly use the parameter names helps add clarity especially when using imported libraries, abstract contracts, ect.

## Specification

I envision constructors and modifiers acting like any other function call. When passed as a struct the parameter order doesn't matter and the key has to match the parameter name in the given constructor / modifier.

```solidity
abstract contract A {
  constructor(string memory _name, uint256 _age) {}
}

contract B is A {
  constructor()
    A({_age: 100, _name: "solidity"})
  {}
}
```

I cannot comment to the implementation of this. But @cameel 's response suggest this is technically viable in the following post.
https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/allow-for-named-parameters-in-constructor/1694

## Backwards Compatibility

Unsure. See forum post above for more details.

Just for reference: If we did this, it would be a breaking change.

Thank you. Does that mean I should close this issue?

This is also on my wishlist, especially for constructors with several parameters.

Thanks for bring this up. However, we have decided to not proceed with this implementation for the time being given our current development focus on the new type system for Experimental Solidity. We intend to postpone any further syntactic sugar or feature development until that is ready.

We're closing this issue now as we would like to reserve issues for fully specified tasks that are staged for implementation. Please know that we have made a note of this in our internal list of community feature requests and if you want to discuss this further and/or gather further support from the community, you can open a discussion on our [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/).
