## Description

For the following contract
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract RandomProgram {
    
    uint256 constant MAX_LOOP_COUNT = 10;
    uint256 constant INITIAL_BALANCE = 100;
    
    struct Person {
        string name;
        uint256 age;
        uint256 balance;
    }

    uint256 globalCount;
    uint256 globalBalance = INITIAL_BALANCE;
    
    function loop() public {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < MAX_LOOP_COUNT; i++) {
            require(i < MAX_LOOP_COUNT, "This require statement is redundant");
            assert(i >= 0 && i < MAX_LOOP_COUNT); // failed to optimize???
            globalCount++;
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                globalBalance -= i;
            } else {
                globalBalance += i;
            }
        }
    }
    
    function conditional(uint256 x, uint256 y) public pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 result;
        if (x > y) {
            result = x - y;
            assert(result > 0);
        } else if (x == y) {
            result = x + y;
            assert(result == 0);
        } else {
            result = y - x;
            assert(result > 0);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
The IR optimizer failed to remove `` assert(i >= 0 && i < MAX_LOOP_COUNT);``.
If i remove the function ``conditional``, the `` assert(i >= 0 && i < MAX_LOOP_COUNT);`` can be optimized.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.19
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix

In this case, the assert statements are conditionally executed based on the values of x and y. The optimizer may not be able to determine the specific values of x and y at compile time and, therefore, cannot optimize away the assert statements.

In general, the Solidity optimizer is designed to remove simple and clear redundancies but may not handle more complex control flow scenarios. Removing assertions that are conditionally executed based on input values can be challenging for the optimizer because it would need to evaluate all possible input combinations at compile time to make a determination about the assertion's necessity.

While optimizing code is beneficial for gas efficiency, it's important to remember that the primary purpose of assertions (assert statements) is to provide runtime checks for detecting unexpected conditions or bugs in your contract. Removing them should be done with caution and a thorough understanding of how it may impact the contract's security and correctness.

correct  me if i am wrong @hpumengzhao
