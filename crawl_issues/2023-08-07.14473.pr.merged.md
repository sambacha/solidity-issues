# [\#14473 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14473) `merged`: Refactor syntax test setup
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `smt`

Closes #14465.

The main goal here is to make it possible to initialize the `CompilerStack` with a custom callback. Unlike #14465 this is done in `AnalysisFramework` only, without touching `CompilerStack` API.

While at it, I also noticed that both `SyntaxTest` and `SMTCheckerTest` don't seem to use the virtual methods provided by base classes the way it was intended. They override `TestCase::run()` instead of `setupCompiler()` and `parseAndAnalyze()` which seem like they were meant to serve as extension points. The PR fixes that as well.
