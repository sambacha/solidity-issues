# [\#14474 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14474) `merged`: Sane error filtering in `AnalysisFramework`
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-08-07 12:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14474):

A small refactor in preparation for #14433.

When implementing that PR I got bitten by unintuitive behavior of `AnalysisStack` with regard to error filtering. `parseAnalyseAndReturnError()` automatically filters out the pre-release warning, which is nice, but it didn't seem to work for me. The warning was still appearing in my output. Finally I noticed that it only filters the error list it returns while the `formatErrors()` still grabs the original list directly from `CompilerStack` and does not even have a way to get the filtered one, which makes it kinda useless. No wonder it's not used more widely.

This PR is an attempt to make error filtering work in a sane way. Also makes more test cases actually use it.
