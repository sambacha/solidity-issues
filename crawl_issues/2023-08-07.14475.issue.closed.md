Prepare https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12246 by means of a warning.
Additionally to a compiler-warning, we should announce this as a plan before releasing it.

It looks like `petersburg` in terms of compiler features is identical with `constantinople` (#6086). I think it would make more sense to either deprecate both or keep both. If we keep one, we won't really be able to drop any code related to the other.

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14591/files#r1350395818 - I adjusted the title here to keep constantinople support around as non-deprecated for now.
