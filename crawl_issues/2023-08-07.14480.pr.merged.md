# [\#14480 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14480) `merged`: Unify preamble injection in `AnalysisFramework`
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Another refactor before #14433.

Even though `AnalysisFramework` can insert preamble automatically, this code is baked into `parseAnalyseAndReturnError()`, which is not universally used by all test cases. The result is that some test cases reinvent the wheel and implement that bit on their own, always slightly differently. Some of them do not insert license if it's already there, some don't care. Some can handle multi-line comments, some can't.

This is quite frustrating because when you're writing a new test case you have to waste time  to figure out why there are so many versions of it, which one you need and how to use it. Then you realize you can't easily reuse it and end up adding yet another copy. This PR unifies all that duplicated code into a reusable `withPreamble()` method available to all test cases inheriting from `AnalysisFramework`.

It would be nice to also have the error filtering automatically adjust error locations to account for the preamble (`SyntaxTest` already has code for doing that), but I'll leave that for another day.
