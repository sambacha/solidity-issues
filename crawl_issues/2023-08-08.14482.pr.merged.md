**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `refactor`

Follow-up to #14474.

While using the error formatting functions in my new natspec test I realized that the `_withErrorIds` flag is broken. The ID is not printed.

The root cause is that `SourceReferenceFormatter`'s API is a bit misleading. `formatExceptionInformation()` has the `_withErrorIds` argument but since it gets `util::Exception` rather than `Error`, it does not have access to the error ID and won't print it. On the other hand `formatErrorInformation()`, which does have the full `Error` for some reason does not offer this argument. Probably because that class already has way too many combinations of arguments (error/error list, char stream/char stream provider, error/exception, output to string/output to stream) and no one needed that particular combination. In cases where we needed error IDs so far, we just used the similar `printErrorInformation()`, which is not a static method and can get values of these options from the formatter instance.

This PR fixes the bug and slightly refactors `SourceReferenceFormatter` to make it less of a footgun. It would be even better to get rid of the `...ExceptionInformation()` variants, but we do need some of them on rare occasions, so it would require a bigger restructuring. I really don't want to get too deep into refactors here so I stopped at replacing its uses with `...ErrorInformation()` where possible.
