I just got a different idea. How about caching not the installed dir but the binary packages that Homebrew downloads? Then it would still install them but that should be quick.

There are some suggestions on how to do that here: [How to use Homebrew to install local archive](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/84403/how-to-use-homebrew-to-install-local-archive).

Actually, maybe caching only `/Users/distiller/Library/Caches/Homebrew` already accomplishes that?

Also, does homebrew touch `/usr/local/{bin,sbin,lib,include}`? If not, we could restore caching those even if we give up on homebrew.

But the homebrew packages are already cached when we cache the `/Users/distiller/Library/Caches/Homebrew` directory. 
```
static:~ distiller$ brew --cache -s wget
/Users/distiller/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/6468b4ed952a797bf746f9180cc0b8d1e7edb4ab441976c21c254c5948e12aa5--wget-1.21.3.tar.gz
```

> Actually, maybe caching only `/Users/distiller/Library/Caches/Homebrew` already accomplishes that?

Yes, but it needs the correspondent `Cellar` directory as well so the `brew link` will be able to update the PATH for the cached kegs (this was the reason I cached the specific kegs on the Cellar directory):
```
static:~ distiller$ brew info wget
==> wget: stable 1.21.3 (bottled), HEAD

```

But yeah, I'm not sure if this is the correct way to cache a homebrew package, since I'm not a macOS user.

> Also, does homebrew touch `/usr/local/{bin,sbin,lib,include}`? If not, we could restore caching those even if we give up on homebrew.

~Yes it does, the binaries/libs/headers are installed there.~
```
static:~ distiller$ which wget
/usr/local/bin/wget
```
UPDATE: the `brew link` command recreate the link to the respective files in `/usr/local/{bin,lib,include}`. So you are right, we don't need to cache those.

But I meant only caching the binary packages which Homebrew uses to install things. I.e. we would cache `Caches/Homebrew` to make sure the packages would not have to be downloaded (which, I am assuming, is the most time consuming part of the installation) and then issue `brew install` commands to let Homebrew install those packages. We would not touch anything under `/usr/local`. This would solve any problems we might have with inconsistent state of these installation dirs.

I was just not sure if caching `Caches/Homebrew` would really make `brew install` instant. Maybe we need to explicitly download those packages somewhere else and pass them to some Homebrew command that can install them directly.

Seeing the issues you're running into, I really think this is the right way forward here. We could do this for evmone, z3 and jsoncpp as well - basically only cache the `wget` command.

But I meant the opposite :) I.e. that if Homebrew does not touch them then we can safely cache them independently, to reenable caching at least for evmone, z3 and jsoncpp, even if we don't manage to do it for Homebrew.

But apparently it does use these dirs? In any case, I'd rather try with the solution I posted above, which should be much less messy.

Also, perhaps we should shelve this for now and go back to it later. I thought it would be useful to try to reenable the cache and see if it works, but we're way beyond that. This was meant to be quick and easy :P

Right. Just to add more context, the files are installed in the `Cellar` directory, and brew just create symlinks to it during installation. For instance:
```
static:~ distiller$ ls -la /usr/local/bin/wget
lrwxr-xr-x  1 distiller  admin  30 Aug 23 09:40 /usr/local/bin/wget -> ../Cellar/wget/1.21.4/bin/wget
```

The binary packages that homebrew use to install things are in the `/Users/distiller/Library/Caches/Homebrew/`:
```
static:~ distiller$ brew --cache wget
/Users/distiller/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/3e0f3235fe3eca0a1afea7053a674a1691e35fd0de2c9330147e4fd4bd543e25--wget--1.21.4.monterey.bottle.tar.gz
```

> I was just not sure if caching `Caches/Homebrew` would really make `brew install` instant. Maybe we need to explicitly download those packages somewhere else and pass them to some Homebrew command that can install them directly.

We could try to force install from a local bottle using: `brew install --force-bottle <package>` however it requires the `Cellar` files of the respective package:

```
static:~ distiller$ brew install --force-bottle wget
==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/formula.jws.json

==> Downloading https://formulae.brew.sh/api/cask.jws.json

Error: No such file or directory - /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/wget
```

Because everything in `/usr/local/{bin,sbin,lib,include,var,opt}` is a symlink to `Cellar`:

```
static:~ distiller$ ls -la /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/wget
lrwxr-xr-x  1 distiller  admin  27 Aug 23 09:40 /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked/wget -> ../../../Cellar/wget/1.21.4

```

So I don't see a way to not cache the `Cellar` directory, which bring us back to my original approach.

Yes, got distracted by the homebrew errors and forgot about those other packages, for those we will need to cache the `/usr/local/{bin,lib,include}` since those packages are installed there.

Why not cache only the downloaded archive like I suggested?

> We could try to force install from a local bottle using: `brew install --force-bottle <package>` however it requires the Cellar files of the respective package:

What happens if you try without `--force-bottle`? According to [Pre-download a file for a formula](https://docs.brew.sh/Tips-N'-Tricks#pre-download-a-file-for-a-formula), a simple `brew install` should be enough to use the bottle from the cache if it's there.

The way I'm suggesting is this:
- Use some brew command that only downloads the formula (but does not build or install the package) get formulas for all the packages we need.
- Build a string containing names and versions of all those packages for use as the cache key.
    - This way the cache will be invalidated whenever one of the packages is updated. But not their dependencies, which we can live with.
- Restore `/Users/home/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/` from that cache key if available.
    - If available, `brew install` will use the packages from there.
    - If not available, `brew install` will populate the cache dir for us prior to installing, including dependencies as well.
- Run `brew install` on all packages to install them.
- Cache `/Users/home/Library/Caches/Homebrew/downloads/` under our cache key for use next time.

Because `evmone`, `z3` and `jsoncpp` are not installed via homebrew and we use part of the installation path of z3 to determine whether we should restore the cache (i.e. ` /usr/local/lib/libz3.a`). But I guess I overlooked your previous comment, and reading it again I see that you said to cache the archives of those packages **as well**. So yeah, we can do it and remove that `if` from the `osx_install_dependencies.sh`.

> What happens if you try without `--force-bottle`? According to [Pre-download a file for a formula](https://docs.brew.sh/Tips-N'-Tricks#pre-download-a-file-for-a-formula), a simple `brew install` should be enough to use the bottle from the cache if it's there.

Yes, indeed. However, in all tests that I tried, even if the package exists in the homebrew's cache but it does not exists in the `Cellar` directory (i.e. it is not restored by the CI cache) the homebrew's cache does not really prevents the download. Not really sure why. The use of `--force-bottle` was an attempt to force brew to use the local bottle.

I believe that for this we can use the `brew fetch <package>`. And then, we could cache the `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/<package_formula>.rb` for the packages that we install using homebrew. However, I don't know if caching only this directory would break homebrew somehow (e.g. when we update xcode version).

Also, having the formula does not help too much I think, since the formula only specify how the package will be installed and does not really contain the necessary files to install it, see for example the [wget formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/d2178c2e9414246a810b27c0cee8e16029ab351f/Formula/w/wget.rb).

I mean, I think we should cache **only** the archives. This makes things simpler because you don't have to worry about some random stuff being in the directories we would otherwise have to cache.

Downloading the binaries is the slow part. Installation is quick, so we can just repeat it every time.

> I believe that for this we can use the `brew fetch <package>`. And then, we could cache the `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/<package_formula>.rb` for the packages that we install using homebrew.

I'd not cache the formulas. I think they should be redownloaded each time. This is because we need a way to know if cache is up to date or not. We can only know that by looking at what the latest versions of the packages are and I assume that homebrew will by default download the latest version of the formula and we'll see the version inside. If any package has been updated, we invalidate the cache, run installation from scratch and cache it.

But for that I'm assuming homebrew must have some command that just downloads the formula independently of the binary packages. Alternatively, maybe it has a command that tells us the latest version of a formula. If it does not, the last resort would be to download the formula manually with wget or git.
