Using latest solc on apple arm64


```bash
solc --ir $CONTRACTNAME
```


```console
$ solc --strict-assembly ir_output
Error: Expected keyword "object".
 --> ir_output:1:1:
  |
1 | IR:
  | ^^
```

Editing the file to comment out the line `IR` results in successful compilation 


```console
$ solc --strict-assembly ir_output

======= ir_output (EVM) =======

Pretty printed source:
```
> truncated success

Could you mention the solc version that you are using to replicate this ? I could have a look.

Hey @sambacha! This isn't a bug as the CLI does not produce outputs that are being machine parsed. If you wish to produce machine readable output, you can check out the Standard JSON Interface.

Is there a specific reason why you would like to do so?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
