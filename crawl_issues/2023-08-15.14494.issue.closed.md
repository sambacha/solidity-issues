Here I am again with another issue with extra files in compilation causing trouble ðŸ«¡ 

By extra files I mean files that the target contract does not depend on.

## Recap 
First a recap on previous issues similarly on extra files in compilation:
1. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12281 
This was an older issue that seems to affect the AST IDs in `0.6.12` and `0.7.0`. We also encountered this and handled in Sourcify's case https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/issues/618
2. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14250 
I've encountered this in a `0.8.19` contract and got fixed in `0.8.21` with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14311.


## Current Issue
I've encountered the current issue in https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/issues/1065. 

My initial suspicion was that it's an instance of the 2. case because the contract was a `0.8.19` contract. Unfortunately, I was able to reproduce the case in `0.8.21`.

Although the 1. case should have been resolved, I suspect it still can be related because **the metadata hashes are identical** but the bytecodes differ. 

### To reproduce
I named inputs as "hardhat" and "sourcify". "Sourcify" uses the minimum number of source files, because it is based on the ones listed in the contract metadata. "Hardhat" uses extra because by default Hardhat inputs everything to the compiler. Sourcify has two different inputs `0.8.19` and `0.8.21` because it includes the `evmVersion` inside the input i.e. `paris` vs `shanghai`.

You can see the two inputs differ only in some extra files + some of the compiler settings

<summary> Also leaving the JS script I used to check the differences of the keys of `.sources` in the JSON inputs </summary>

Usage:
`node checkFileKeysDifferences.js solcInput-1.json solcInput-2.json`

```js
const fs = require("fs");

function findKeyDifferences(file1, file2) {
  const json1 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file1, "utf8"));
  const json2 = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file2, "utf8"));

  const sources1 = new Set(Object.keys(json1.sources) || []);
  const sources2 = new Set(Object.keys(json2.sources) || []);

  const keysOnlyInFile1 = Array.from(sources1).filter(
    (key) => !sources2.has(key)
  );
  const keysOnlyInFile2 = Array.from(sources2).filter(
    (key) => !sources1.has(key)
  );

  return {
    keysOnlyInFile1,
    keysOnlyInFile2,
  };
}

// Retrieve file paths from command-line arguments
const [file1Path, file2Path] = process.argv.slice(2);

if (!file1Path || !file2Path) {
  console.log("Please provide two file paths as command-line arguments.");
  process.exit(1);
}

const { keysOnlyInFile1, keysOnlyInFile2 } = findKeyDifferences(
  file1Path,
  file2Path
);

console.log("Keys only in file 1:", keysOnlyInFile1);
console.log("Keys only in file 2:", keysOnlyInFile2);
```

To extract the runtime bytecode:
```
cat N2MERC721-sourcify-input-0.8.19.json | solc --standard-json | jq '.contracts."contracts/N2MERC721.sol".N2MERC721.evm.deployedBytecode.object' > N2MERC721-0.8.19-sourcify-runtime-bytecode-from-solc.txt

## Environment

- Compiler version: `0.8.19` and `0.8.21` (both Emscripten and Darwin.appleclang)  
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): `paris` and `shanghai`
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): none
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: MacOS


Again, one particular thing that got my attention was that the metadata hashes were identical in all cases. This leaves me thinking if this is similar to the 1. case I mentioned.

Ok, I can so far confirm that this will result in different libevmasm assembly.
The optimized IR differs in two ways, both due to differing AST IDs:
- identifier names - that should not affect assembling these days, though
- string identifiers for immutables - that may be worth a look, maybe we missed an effect of that

The assembly differs in some details in the stack ordering (I e.g. see different swaps). Haven't been able to trace down a reason yet.

Interestingly, the difference in swapping is not equivalent, e.g. I'm seeing stuff like
```
-      dup2
+      dup3
```

So this may also be non-determinism in the stack layouts (yielding different stack layouts across basic blocks resulting in differing stack shuffling). But I'd rather expect it to be a secondary effect of something else.

But ok - optimized Yul being identical modulo AST IDs, but libevmasm assembly differing points towards the code transform

Independently of solving this particular issue, though, since we seem to keep running into, we should look into test coverage for this. So far, the ultimate reason has been offsets in the AST IDs, so we should consider a bytecode comparison run with an artificial offset in the AST IDs - that may catch more of these cases, resp. avoid them in the future.

Looking more closely at this again, there's actually a small differences in the optimized Yul that may explain the divergence, so it's may be the yul optimizer after all.

The difference is an additional variable in one yul function:

```yul
            function fun_upperBinaryLookup(var_self_3885_slot, var_key, var_low, var_high) -> var
            {

                for { }
                                                       lt(var_low, var_high)

                { }
                {

                    let expr := and(var_low, var_high)

                    let _1 := 1
                    let sum := add(expr, shr(_1, xor(var_low, var_high)))

                    if gt(expr, sum) { panic_error_0x11() }

                    let var_mid := sum

                    mstore( 0, var_self_3885_slot)

                    let _2 := 0xffffffff
                    let cleaned := and(sload( add(keccak256( 0, 0x20), sum)), _2)

                    switch gt( cleaned, and( var_key, _2))
                    case 0 {

                        let sum_1 := add(sum, _1)
                        if gt(sum, sum_1) { panic_error_0x11() }

                        var_low := sum_1
                    }
                    default
                    {

                        var_high := var_mid
                    }
                }

                var := var_high
            }
```

vs

```yul
            function fun_upperBinaryLookup(var_self_slot, var_key, var_low, var_high) -> var
            {

                for { }
                                                       lt(var_low, var_high)

                { }
                {

                    let expr := and(var_low, var_high)

                    let _1 := 1
                    let sum := add(expr, shr(_1, xor(var_low, var_high)))

                    if gt(expr, sum) { panic_error_0x11() }

                    mstore( 0, var_self_slot)

                    let _2 := 0xffffffff
                    let cleaned := and(sload( add(keccak256( 0, 0x20), sum)), _2)

                    switch gt( cleaned, and( var_key, _2))
                    case 0 {

                        let sum_1 := add(sum, _1)
                        if gt(sum, sum_1) { panic_error_0x11() }

                        var_low := sum_1
                    }
                    default
                    {

                        var_high := sum
                    }
                }

                var := var_high
            }
```


``var_mid`` is eliminated in one version.

Eliminating the variable manually yields the same bytecode again (so it's not the naming in yul identifiers or immutables).

I played with this today with the intention of preparing a bytecode comparison run for #14495. Unfortunately a simple addition of a single file with pragmas or even a simple contract to compilation does not seem to break things - bytecode check passes just fine. Something more complicated is needed to trigger this.

So I tried to reduce this issue to a minimal example to figure out the necessary conditions and here's what I was left with:

```bash
mkdir @

cat <<=== > a.sol
    import "@/za.sol";
    import "b.sol";

    contract A is B {
        function a() public pure {
            zb();
        }
    }
===

cat <<=== > b.sol
    import "@/zb.sol";
    import "c.sol";

    abstract contract B is C {}
===

cat <<=== > c.sol
    abstract contract C
    {
        function f() public pure {}

        function c() public view returns (uint) {
            try this.f() { return 0; }
            catch {}
        }
    }
===

cat <<=== > @/za.sol
    import "@/zc.sol";
===

cat <<=== > @/zb.sol
    import "@/zc.sol";

    function zb() pure {
        zc();
    }
===

cat <<=== > @/zc.sol
    function zc() pure returns (bytes memory returndata) {
        if (returndata.length == 0) {
            return "";
        }
    }
===

diff --color --unified \
    <(solc a.sol b.sol --bin --via-ir --optimize | grep '======= a.sol:A =======' --after-context=2 | fold --width 100) \
    <(solc a.sol       --bin --via-ir --optimize | grep '======= a.sol:A =======' --after-context=2 | fold --width 100)
```

I could not go below 6 files or get rid of a subdirectory, though I suspect this is needed only due to the way it affects the import/compilation order and examples without it should be possible as well.

The import pattern goes like this:

```
aâ”€â”€â–ºzaâ”€â”€â–ºzc
â”‚         â–²
â–¼         â”‚
bâ”€â”€â–ºzbâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
â”‚
â–¼
c
```

But the pattern itself is not enough. The `try`/`catch` and all the other calls are necessary and must also be placed in specific files.

Not sure if I should continue with the bytecode check in that case. Seems like it will be hard to come up with something that does not cause issues by itself, but does when combined with some random code examples and is not simply this specific case.

Sadly, I think what you found there is a completely unrelated issue. In your case I see a different order of Yul functions in optimized IR code, whereas in the orginally posted example, I see a single variable not being eliminated from one Yul function. The underlying cause may still be the same, but the symptoms are different enough that I'd actually expect two causes.

But yeah, since it then looks like it's non-trivial to guard against these cases by traditional testing, I wonder if fuzzing can help (pinging @bshastry). To summarize the overreaching problem here for @bshastry: We want to guarantee that the bytecode the compiler produces for a contract ``A`` is the same, if all the sources and compiler settings involved in generating code for ``A`` are the same. However, in via-IR code generation we keep hitting cases, in which adding completely unrelated source files (e.g. for a contract ``B``) to the same compiler run, will affect the bytecode of contract `A`. The idea would be to generate two random source files, each containing a random contract, and compile those individually (using the optimized via-IR pipeline) first, and then check that the compiler produces identical bytecode for each of them, if both are compiled at the same time.
I'd imagine setting up a fuzzing pipeline for this should be rather simple - and we do have the cases above still open on develop currently, so we could see if we get them reported by the fuzzer as a sanity check.

The target here would not be to find security vulnerabilities, but compiler misbehaviour that's causing issues for tooling.

Idea from the call: create a `NameRandomizer` step and use it with fuzzing or bytecode comparison to check if the bytecode changes.

I just had another quick look at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14494#issuecomment-1692358415 - that indeed has a differing order of functions in unoptimized IR already, so it's indeed a different issue that already occurs in via-IR code generation and not only during optimization (the original case of this issue is confirmed in the optimizer, since it vanishes if we ignore the name hints in the name dispenser of the yul optimizer)

@ekpyron Just so I understand correctly

Source A
```
contract A { ... }
```

Source B
```
contract B { ... }
```

where the two source files are generated at random. And then,

we compile using optimized via-ir setting

Compilation 1: Source A: contract A
Compilation 2: Source B: contract B
Compilation 3: Source A + Source B: contract A
Compilation 4: Source A + Source B: contract B

and the invariant that should hold is bytecodes of the following pairs are identical?

- (1) and (3)
- (2) and (4)

tl;dr In each fuzzing iteration, the fuzzer generates two random source units and performs a total of 4 compilations to check if individual and combined compilation produce the same bytecode.

I'm also wondering if wrt https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14494#issuecomment-1727548366, it suffices to compare (1) and (3), thereby limiting it to two compilations per fuzzer iteration since source A and B are generated uniformly at random.

Also, in the original issue above, there seem to be more than two source files. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14494#issuecomment-1692358415 says at least 6 source files were required to trigger issue, so I'm wondering if two source fuzzing setup would suffice. Maybe, generate N source files (N > 2), pick one contract from one source at random and check if individual and grouped (all N source files) report identical bytecode?

Yes, changing (1) and (3), respectively in general picking one specific contract, should suffice. The case of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14494#issuecomment-1692358415 was a bit different and we already solved it in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14562 - that case relied on the files to actually import each other, which would make a fuzzing setup more complicated, but it's also less likely that there's more hidden issues like this.

So I'd focus on cases like originally reported here, which are in the Yul optimizer and won't involve importing, but just additional source files - but additional source files are also just the means for changing AST IDs (our guarantee is that changing AST IDs should not affect compilation result).

So in the meantime @cameel had the idea of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14548, which may work for tracing issues like this down more directly - for fuzzing this would just mean:

- Generate a random contract A
- Compile A via-ir optimized to bytecode (artifact 1)
- Export the AST of the random source file to json.
- In that json AST randomly permute all AST IDs.
- Import the result and compile again via-ir optimized to bytecode (artifact 2)
- Check that artifact 1 and artifact 2 are identical.

We wanted to build that as regular CI run on our test suite first to see if that already catches the issue we have on ``develop`` - if not, trying to fuzz with this mechanism on random contracts might be worth a try. The underlying issue is really to avoid the Yul optimizer to be affected by different AST IDs - this setup should catch exactly that.

I debugged this yesterday and found the problem - the direct cause of the disappearance of the `var_mid` variable in @ekpyron's snippet is the fact that `CommonSubexpressionEliminator` chooses a different replacement expression. This in turn is caused by a bug in `DataFlowAnalyzer`.

Here's the analysis I posted on the channel:

> The reason that CSE chooses a different variable is that in one case `DataFlowAnalyzer` loses knowledge about the value of that variable and in the other that knowledge is present. Without that knowledge it won't substitute that variable in expressions. It instead moves on to choose another candidate.

> The bug is in [the variable clearing loop in `DataFlowAnalyzer::clearValues()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/libyul/optimiser/CommonSubexpressionEliminator.cpp#L122-L126). The loop iterates over a set while adding new items to it, which probably results in some items being skipped and not cleared (if they happen to sort before the element we're currently at). Which elements are skipped depends on how they sort and that depends on variable names. In this case it's actually not just different AST IDs but a variable having an ID in one case and not having it in another: `var_low` vs `var_low_7623`. I suspect that just a different number would not cause this on their own because the IDs would still retain their order relative to each other.

> The funny thing is that this bug is something that I already noticed a few months ago, while reviewing @nikola-matic's changes to the `DataFlowAnalyser` PR that's still pending: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14112#discussion\_r1207017088. It looked fishy and broken, but not _that_ serious. I did not even realize that it could have such deep consequences.

Today I prepared a proper fix for it (#14574) and verified that it really works. I also created a smaller repro to include as a regression test. At first I tried from Solidity level but it was too hard because the bug requires naming differences to be triggered and these differences are caused by the AST ID differences. It would probably have to be based on that multi-file repro I posted above. In the and I gave up and instead trimmed down the unoptimized Yul output. That reproduces the problem when passed through `solc --strict-assembly --optimize`.

Combined with @r0qs's fix, this now compiles the Standard JSON input from the description without bytecode differences
