Makes 2 improvements:

1. Checks if `git` is installed before executing the command. If not, it will inform the user to do so.
2. Git Tag Check: The command `git tag --points-at HEAD` might produce multiple tags. To handle this scenario, it will use the first one if it happens.

Thanks for the PR, but we don't see a particular need for these changes and checking for the first git tag is not necessarily correct if there were more tags either, so we're closing the PR.
