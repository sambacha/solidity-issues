Prerequisite for #14433.

I originally planned to derive my new Natspec test case from `TestCase` with `AnalysisFramework` as a mixin. This allowed me to go 90% of the way, but then it turned out that some useful behaviors of our syntax tests are not a reusable part of the base test case, but available only in `SyntaxTest`:
- Formatting errors the same way as in syntax tests (and parsing that format back).
- Highlighting locations of syntax errors in he source.
- Multi-file tests.

Some of them are in `CommonSyntaxTest`, but that in turn does not use `AnalysisFramework` and I'd have to reimplement some of the functionality that `SyntaxTest` already has.

This PR modifies `CommonSyntaxTest` and `SyntaxTest` to make it easier to use them as a base for test cases that want to include errors and warnings in their expectations, but also have extra output when analysis succeeds. The Natspec test case will use this mechanism to expect either errors (if Natspec is invalid) or JSON content.
