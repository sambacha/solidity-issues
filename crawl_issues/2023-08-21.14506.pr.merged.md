Fixes #14433.
Depends on #14505.

I recommend reviewing commits individually in this PR. There's a lot of file moves and simple changes that can be easily skimmed, but this is not apparent in the unified diff.

Oh wow, how long did this take to move from cpp to isoltest? :rocket:

If you mean moving the test cases, not much. I spent a few hours writing a test parser. Later I ran it and it did all the work for me (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14433#issuecomment-1645551392). That was actually the easiest part :)

I spent more trying to actually reuse isoltest base classes. I went through a few dead ends in the process. Still, it wasn't by itself that hard and I was actually sitting on this being 90% finished, and waiting for my other refactors to go in.

Then it turned out that this last 10% is more annyoing than expected and some features I needed for one more complex test case could not be easily reused. So before the weekend I rewrote the test case on top of `SyntaxTest` (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14505) and got this.
