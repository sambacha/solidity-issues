This is a quick refactor I did recently for #14478 when I wanted to parameterize our `run_build` step. This would allow me to parameterize it with the number of CPUs. In the end I chose a different approach and did not need it, but I think we should still merge it. It's something I wanted to clean up for quite a while but never had a good reason to actually do it.

Until now we've been YAML fragments under the `defaults` key to define sequences of steps or lists of artifacts. The downside of that mechanism is that it's pretty crude and requires workarounds to compose well in some situations (e.g. we need to wrap a list of steps in a condition if we're appending to another list rather than replacing it whole). Reusable commands are a way to do that with fewer quirks. They also have parameters, which will make them easier to extend in the future.

I recommend viewing the diff with whitespace ignored and preferably looking at individual commits. The changes are pretty straightforward, there's just quite a few of them, and this should make it more apparent.
