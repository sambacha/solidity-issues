## Description

`bytes.concat` does not work when defining constants.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.21
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Hardhat default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Hardhat
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu

## Steps to Reproduce

This code compiles:
```solidity
contract Test {
    bytes32 internal constant A = bytes32('a');
    bytes32 internal constant B = bytes32('b');
    bytes internal constant AB = abi.encodePacked(A, B);
}
```

This does not:
```solidity
contract Test {
    bytes32 internal constant A = bytes32('a');
    bytes32 internal constant B = bytes32('b');
    bytes internal constant AB = bytes.concat(A, B);
}
```

Solidity currently generally doesn't have compile-time constant expression evaluation - we plan to change that in the future and this will extend to ``bytes.concat`` as well, so I'm closing this issue as covered by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157

EDIT: actually, looking at it again, the divergence between ``abi.encodePacked`` and ``bytes.concat`` is inconsistent - sorry, I didn't look properly earlier. There is no compile-time constant evaluation happening for ``abi.encodePacked``, but the expression is allowed as ``constant`` and inlined - we can look into doing the same for ``bytes.concat`` for consistency, even though ideally this would be covered by proper compile-time constant expression evaluation a la https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3157

I am new to this repository , can someone guide me about how can I help in solving this issue? Do we need to implement the `concat` function taking inputs as `const` initializers as well? And if yes, where can I find its implementation? @ekpyron
