This is far from complete and even the parts that are in here need some reworking, so I'm mainly posting it for a basis for discussing and splitting up further work.

Notes:
- The ``SyntaxRestrictor`` is preliminary and (probably) incomplete.
- The ``DebugWarner`` is just used for printing the result of type inference as info messages.

Among the issues:
- The bogus codegen assumes everything is one stack slot - it will need to reintroduce an ``IRVariable`` mechanism to account for larger types.
  Also it'd be interesting to explore if and how "size on stack" could be conceptually a construct defined in-language (i.e. a type class property that is merely directly inherited/derived on type declarations; optional - also fine to determine it hard-coded for now).
- The PR currently introduces several keywords for builtin types and type classes and has a notion of "builtin" and "primitive" types. That has several issues:
    - There's overhead in hardcoding these types/classes.
    - The stdlib concept means that these constructs shouldn't in fact be globally available, but rather explicitly imported.
    - The distinction between primitive/builtin/user-defined constructs introduces overhead on all uses.
  What should rather happen is:
       - Even the most basic primitive types and classes are user-defined.
       - We introduce a way to mark specific type and class declarations as having special semantics (like being "the" ``word`` type that may cross the assembly barrier). This means name resolution and type checking (other than for the cases involving special semantics) works as usual, so this immediately yields proper scoping *and* reduces special-casing. E.g. ``type word = __builtin("word");`` or as separate top-level statement ``__builtin_type("word", word);``
       - Only one type can be registered as any specific builtin type. I.e. ``type word1 = __builtin("word"); type word2 = _builtin("word");`` is invalid.
- Polymorphic recursion is not actively avoided (this may be implicit in the current handling and just need double-checking or a more involved tracking mechanism).
- The order of visitation during type inference is important, which allows for introducing issues (e.g. importing into scope and generalizing too soon) and potentially makes error-reporting harder.
- Potentially the split into TypeRegistration and TypeInference can be avoided - or, maybe, the system can be split up more properly in multiple passes (late unification as in "Generalized Hindley-Milner"? Issues with generalization on importing functions - but can potentially type-check functions (sets of mutually recursing functions?) individually)
- The introduced syntax is temporary.
- Longer-term we may need a monomorphization pass during analysis - and could then store more information in monomorphized annotations instead of having more logic during codegen.
- Explicit free type variables in function signatures have improper scope (``function f(x:a) {}`` works, while ``function f(x:a) -> a {}`` fails with undeclared identifier). Potentially we should have explicit syntax for free type variables (like ``'a`` or ``?a``) or for declaring free types (like ``function f<a>(x:a) -> a`` or ``forall a. function f(x:a) -> a``)
- Obviously a lot of features are missing (below a subset in no particular ordering):
    - Generalized type classes (multiple type variables, etc.) - respectively, extracting the type-class logic from unification (``HM(X)``-style)
    - Conversions from literals
    - Algebraic data types
    - Function pointers.
    - Type class hierarchy: subclasses (a class that requires a different class, but extends it)
    - static assertions (will probably require a monomorphized analysis pass)
    - ...
- Obviously, there's also no test coverage.

Infrastructure issues:
- AST import/export test scripts need to exclude experimental solidity tests.

Currently experimental tests break in the codegen even via IR. We'll need to fix that, but I really need to be able to see the output from the inference so I added back the hack we used to have until that happens.

Removing the commit with a hack that disabled codegen in syntax tests before I merge #14660.

Ok, there seems to be some difference in bytecode comparison's handling of unimplemented feature errors between cli and standard json - and something in soltest needs to deal with them more gracefully, but it doesn't look like much is left

Well, and the error code test coverage of course needs to ignore this (we need to see if there's a better way than adding all of them to the exclusion list, but if need be we can do that)

We also have to deal with uncovered error codes somehow, and I'm not sure that ignoring them is the best option; should likely have at least some basic test coverage for them.

Also, the `functionDependencyGraph` tests should be excluded from the AST JSON tests, since we don't allow import/export of experimental ASTs.

On a side note - why are we [disallowing this](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp#L968) in the experimental mode - we can't have semantic tests without, except we already have working tests, so all this assert did was to essentially disallow previously working functionality. 
Removing this assert allows the experimental tests to pass , and basically fixes all of the *soltest failing steps.

Yeah, I see no reason to disable it. When reviewing #14659 I assumed that all the asserted outputs are unusable due to missing annotation and either segfault or produce broken output. If they are not, we should re-enable them.

BTW, does `metadata` output work too? If it does, that would also solve the bytecode comparison problem.

It's not different handling between CLI and StandardJSON. It's actually *the lack* of different handling. CLI and StandardJSON behave differently with regard to what outputs they produce as I already reported in #13925. For example StandardJSON may give you metadata even in presence of codegen ICEs. I still think that the right way to solve this is to make these two interfaces behave consistently. But it can of course be solved also by hard-coding the report generatorto ignore metadata in some cases. That's messier though.

> Well, and the error code test coverage of course needs to ignore this (we need to see if there's a better way than adding all of them to the exclusion list, but if need be we can do that)

I think we should just add them all to the exclusion list. That will force us to later do a proper pass of fixing error handling and adding proper coverage for them rather than glossing over it just to get the script to shut up. Right now the prototype is not complete enough for us to be able to cover it properly (unstable syntax, testing corner cases very often triggers ICEs). If we want to avoid forgetting about this, we could add an issue for it already or list it in [Experimental Solidity quirks to deal with eventually](https://notes.ethereum.org/@solidity/B17LDFQS6).

I made a quick checklist here to track remaining work on this: #14729.

There is already a PR with the workaround to the failing prb-math test.
