# [\#14511 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14511) `merged`: Semantic tests via IR
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Resolves #12668.

The PR is a revival of #11949, with some adjustments.

In the end, it turned out that thanks to #13972 none of our tests actually needs the newly introduced settings at the moment. Not even at the `minimalStack` level. I left it in, but I could also easily remove it by dropping the two middle commits.

The complications I ran into were of a completely different nature: #14500 and one weird failure on homestead which I initially tried to debug but eventually resolved simply by increasing the gas values used in the test.

Nice, I was hoping that'd happen!

The only reason why we may want to keep the setting would be if we ever have a bug involving a recursive function (for which we can't do stack-to-memory) and which will only compile with optimizer... Given that, if it's not too much of a hassle to address https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14511#discussion_r1302041690 (if that comment is actually even true), we can keep the setting for now, even though it's currently a bit of an unnecessarily complication. (But I'd also not object to removing it.)

Sure, I have no issue with keeping it and I also already fixed the problem you found.

Some jobs are failing but this looks like some CircleCI breakage, not a problem with the PR:

> Starting container cimg/node:current
> Warning: No authentication provided, using CircleCI credentials for pulls from Docker Hub.
>   image cache not found on this host, downloading cimg/node:current
>
> Error response from daemon: unauthorized: authentication required
