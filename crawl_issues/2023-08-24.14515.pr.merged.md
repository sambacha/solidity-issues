In our downstream project, we have two dependencies: solidity and spdlog. Both of them depend on fmtlib. Unfortunately, the versions of fmtlib they use do not match, which leads to compilation failure.

The issue arises because spdlog attempts to use solidity's fmtlib, but the specific version (v8.0.1) has a bug. Ref: https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/issues/2142

While we could keep this change in our own fork, we believe it would be worthwhile to contribute it back to the upstream since spdlog is a very popular logging library.

> Is there any particular reason for not bumping to the latest upstream version (10.1.0)?

Hi, thanks for your review I appreciate it. Yes, we do have a reason for this. So actually the spdlog itself has tried to bump fmtlib into the latest version but soon the change got reverted. (https://github.com/gabime/spdlog/commit/4338b9cd23c90c7bacde5bfefddade8d02dfd821) They didn't mention why but the builder log showed the windows bot failed (https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gabime/spdlog/builds/47446958) Maybe it's the reason. So considering the compatibility and stability we chose only bump to 9.1.0.
