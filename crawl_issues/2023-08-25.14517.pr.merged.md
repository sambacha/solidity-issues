# [\#14517 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14517) `merged`: Generalize helpers for indenting and prefixing
**Labels**: `refactor`

Another refactor related to #14433.

This one comes from the fact that at one point I needed a function to indent a chunk of output and I found several, neither of them accessible to me.

In the end I changed the way expectations are formatted and did not need that function (which is why #14506 does not depend on this refactor) but since I already cleaned this up, I think we should still merge it.
