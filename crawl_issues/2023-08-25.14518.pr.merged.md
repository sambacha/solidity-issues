This is the main part of the refactors I did for #14506, before I switched to `SyntaxTest` as a base class (which is why that PR does not depend on this refactor now).

This factors out common compiler stack setup and operation into several virtual functions in `AnalysisFramework`. These functions are generally usable as is but can also be customized in test cases that do some non-standard things. This makes the design closer to the one already used by `SyntaxTest`.

The rest of the PR is the adjustment of existing test cases to use that mechanism. Until now most of them were actually ignoring what `AnalysisFramework` provides, using it only as a holder for `CompilerStack`. Only the Boost-based tests were using it for more via `parseAnalyseAndReturnError()` and `parseAndAnalyse()`. The problem with these functions though was that while the names imply something pretty generic, they were coded for one particular way to run `CompilerStack` - which seems to be the reason why the rest of the test cases ignored them. This PR rewrites them on the new system and gives them names that better reflect what they're doing.

The refactor does not really save us that much code, but makes things less confusing and error-prone. It consolidates the disparate bits that run compiler stack on test code with a single consistent one that respects the CLI options (like `--optimize` or `--evm-version`) by default.
