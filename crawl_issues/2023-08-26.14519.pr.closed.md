Hi @Aryan9592 , I don't think that your proposed change is correct. That sentence is syntactically correct. The definite article `the` refers to the word `language` and avoids its repetition, as in, `the one (language) of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.` 
If we remove `the` from the sentence, then it reads as if the language is close to one out of many EVMs. Instead, what it's desired is: the language (of inline assembly) is close to **the one** language used by the EVM.
