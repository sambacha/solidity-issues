# [\#14527 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14527) `closed`: Feature request: Allow initialize array
**Labels**: `feature`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40341007?u=73a96d4874c3459748a0af8078fc8d1c5dde6a4b&v=4" width="50">[drortirosh](https://github.com/drortirosh) opened issue at [2023-08-31 14:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14527):

Currently, there is no easy way to initialize an array:
```js
uint256[] memory b = [1,2,3];
```
yields:
`Type uint8[3] memory is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256[] memory`

The only alternative is:
```js
uint256[] memory a = new uint256[](3);
a[0] = 1;
a[1] = 2; 
a[2] = 3;
```

## Solution:

Actually, there are 2 separate issues here:
1. allow "automatic upsizing" of array types. That is, allow initializing `uint256[3]` with `[1,2,3]`, instead of requiring the developer to do `[uint(1),2,3]`
2. generate the code to initialize a dynamic array (that is, initialize `uint256[]` from `uint256[3]`), effectively by performing the one-by-one initialization described above

I think this issue deserves some attention, and would make code (even if mostly for tests) much more readable and usable.

True, but we're close this as a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11879, which has more details
