## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html

## Abstract

Natspec does not mention how to describe custom errors, while in [this official blog post](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2021/04/21/custom-errors/) there is natspec for custom errors.

Also, natspec should support `@notice` or `@dev`. or whatever, have the same behavior as for events.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
