# [\#14531 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14531) `closed`: Split out experimental analysis
**Labels**: `selected for development`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2023-09-04 14:06](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14531):

Split out a first batch of technical infrastructure of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510 into a PR targetting develop.

Parts that should go into the new PR:
- The new scanner kind ``ScannerKind::ExperimentalSolidity`` and the surrounding scanner changes (including the small change to ``libyul/AsmParser``). Only the tokens ``NonExperimentalEnd`` and ``ExperimentalEnd`` need to be extracted.
- A stub version of `experimental/analysis/Analysis` without any annotation logic and with only a ``check`` function that always reports an error "experimental analysis not yet implemented" and returns ``false``.
- The changes to ``CompilerStack``, i.e. a special path for experimental solidity, invoking `experimental/analysis/Analysis``
   - Including the assertion in ``CompilerStack::compile`` and a similar assertion in ``CompilerStack::generateIR`` (instead of invoking `experimental::IRGenerator` just put in a failing assertion as well)

What does **not** have to be moved right away:
- Additional tokens
- Changes to the parser
- Changes to the NameAndTypeResolver and ReferenceResolver
- Generally, none of the changes to the currnet analysis steps (like in ``SyntaxChecker``)
- The additional AST nodes and their annotations and visitor logic
- The actual logic of ``experimental/analysis/Analysis.*`` - we can start from a stub that just always fails, see above
- The actual analysis steps in ``experimental/analysis/*``
- Code generation or AST `experimental/ast`, `experimental/codegen`

This will cause the existing experimental solidity import tests to fail, but that's fine to accept on develop for now.
