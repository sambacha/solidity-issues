Currently we still have some tests that use the legacy pipeline, most of them in the `cmdlineTests` suite. We should switch them over to `--via-ir`.

Examples:
- [`~compilation_tests`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests/~compilation_tests/test.sh)
- [`~documentation_examples`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests/~documentation_examples/test.sh)
- [`docs_version_pragma_check.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/docs_version_pragma_check.sh)

Many of them use the `compileFull` helper, so making it run via IR by default would be a good idea.

Find them all and convert them.

This is increasingly becoming a problem. Now we have documentation examples that are IR-only and are therefore are not being checked at all (#15130).
