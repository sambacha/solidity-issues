This is another approach to #14495, with the ultimate goal of detecting issues like #14494.

The idea is to compare the bytecode output from normal compilation and one from compilation with randomized AST IDs. The randomization can be done by exporting the AST, processing it and reimporting.

This could be done in two ways:
- By adding the import/export option to [`prepare_report.py`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.py).
- By adding randomization in [`ASTImportTest.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.21/scripts/ASTImportTest.sh).

The latter will probably be quicker to do. The former is likely more future-proof though. We will rewrite `ASTImportTest.sh` in Python eventually and perhaps we should even change it to work more like `prepare_report.py`, i.e. generate a report.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
