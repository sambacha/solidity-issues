> Should probably at least mentioned that this is now possible in the [docs](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/contracts/events.rst?plain=1#L12).

Good point. I changed that bit to mention file-level events.

I also changed one of the examples to use such an event. Might be better to do it with one of the more relevant examples, but in all cases it seemed artificial to me and would IMO make those examples slightly worse. Currently they're all consistently using things defined within a single contract (errors, functions, types, etc.) so doing that just for events seemed forced and out of place.
