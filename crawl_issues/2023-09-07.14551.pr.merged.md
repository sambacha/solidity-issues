Based on a conversation with @hrkrshnn, this PR adds clarification to the `function modifiers` section of the docs regarding the behavior of modifiers with post-execution actions.

Specifically, it clarifies two facts:
- If a function returns directly from an assembly block, all post-call execution in the modifier will be skipped.
- If the `_;` symbol is included in a modifier multiple times, the function will return the value from the final occurrence.
