# [\#14552 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14552) `merged`: Work around differences in `lexically_normal()` on Boost 1.78+ and bump cmake and boost versions

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2023-09-08 16:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14552):

Fixes #14396.
Replaces #13434.

The problem is basically what I figured out in the original PR - the `//` part in UNC paths no longer remains unchanged after [`lexically_normal()`](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_83_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#lexically_normal) so paths like `//a/b/c` are no longer considered normalized on Windows. The lexical normalization now changes `//` to `\\` (rather than `/` as I surmised). 

The good news is that all it affects is one of the sanity checks. Our portable normalization still works correctly because it always ignored the direction of slashes (`\\` gets normalized back to `//`). The fix is to relax the check to accept the unexpected backslashes.

This means that a Windows binary built with boost 1.78+ despite failing tests will not interpret paths in the wrong way. It may throw an ICE when it gets an UNC path, which is suboptimal, but such paths should be rare anyway. BTW I think we might even be better off disallowing them in the long term - they're not portable and just complicate the path logic for little practical gain.

Neat, just need to figure out what to do with `b_osx` now. By the way, has anyone complained to circleCI support?

It is fixed on the develop branch. We just need to upgrade the packages before. And no, I guess nobody complained to CircleCI support yet.

Wait, wasn't bumping the version specifically to make it compatible with VS2022? What Boost version is VS compatible with?

See, it's been so long, and I no longer have a Windows machine on me, but I'm sure we can dig up the exact cause from a million other issues/PRs related to this topic. If I remember correctly - what we actually wanted to do was to bump the boost version, but this wasn't possible with VS2019 tooling, so we instead had to do it with VS2022; but doing it like that then yielded the issue you're fixing in this PR (`lexically_normal`).

Ah, so you mean it's not compatible with **VS2019**.

Yes.

But in CI we're using VS 2019 toolchain, aren't we? At least that's what I infer from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/9bce5f91dc0204be12a646d47e67803872a021f8/.circleci/build_win.ps1#L21

And the PR works just fine with that version.

And switching to 2022 would actually require doing the stuff we tried in #12802.

BTW, good point about the docs, I noticed that I should have changed boost requirement from hard `1.77` to `1.77+`.

Ah correct, then I misremembered (see @ekpyron's [comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12802/files#r827865507)); I clearly remember that some version of boost was incompatible with some version of VS, but wasn't sure which one.

Now that you've dug out that PR - we could try running everything on newer Windows images in another PR.

Yeah, I guess we could revive that old PR and update to VS 2022. I'll leave that Windows adventure to someone else though :P
