We use these two functions for resolving relative imports and remappings. The transformation performed by the former can really be considered a part of the language and must be platform-independent. I doubt it's actually true in practice since these functions use `boost::filesystem` and are not covered with tests, which makes them susceptible to silent changes in behavior of the library. There were many such changes between versions or platforms.

Since I finally got around to fixing #14396, I thought I'd also add some coverage here. This is a key missing piece if we want to migrate to `std::filesystem` at some point and be sure we do not accidentally introduce tiny breaking changes to the way imports work.

I actually thought we had more filesystem code like that, but looks like apart from `FileReader`, this is the only bit where we really cares about how paths look like.
