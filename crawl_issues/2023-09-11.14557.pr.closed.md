I have a feeling some tests are about to start failing :) Did you run `./tests/cmdlineTests.sh`?

It's also gonna need a changelog entry.

The problem is that I'd say we'd have to consider this a breaking change, so we can't just drop it on ``develop`` (and we currently don't keep the ``breaking`` branch up to date)

Didn't read that, should I point the PR to `breaking` branch?

I'm making last touches to shell tests, and adding entry log as pointed by niko-matic


maybe you can fetch the PR to `breaking` after merges?

Alright best thingy here, it's i will finish touching the tests, then make pass CI and I will re-open another PR pointing to `breaking`, you guys decide which one to merge

We cannot merge this as is since this is a breaking change.
