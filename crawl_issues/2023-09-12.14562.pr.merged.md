Ah, ok - you said that bytecode comparison was failing - I thought you only meant in the new "randomized AST IDs" version, but it looks like it's also failing just due to this change?
I guess that means that we do not *always* add functions to this queue in a deterministic order after all, so we still need to check that.

It's probably the fact that `AscendingFunctionIDCompare` was removed from the definition of `DispatchSet` so it now sorts based on pointer addresses.

This will just default to `std::less`, which should have well defined total ordering, right?

Ordering is well defined, but it does not help when addresses are different on each run :)

Ah, right as always @cameel :)

Yes, I thought that it should not interfere in code generation, but I guess I was wrong. The function `IRGenerationContext::initializeInternalDispatch` iterates over the set and calls `enqueueFunctionForCodeGeneration`, so it affects the order as well, as you pointed out. I completely replaced the set by a queue, and this should fix the problem now.

It would be best if we could add the repro from the issue as a test. How about adding a custom CLI test in the same vein as e.g. [`~via_ir_equivalence`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/cmdlineTests/~via_ir_equivalence/test.sh)?

BTW, note that these custom CLI test can be written directly in Python. The current ones are all Bash simply because they used to be a part of `cmdlineTests.sh`.

Indeed. I did it in another branch to ease the review process. Please let me know if that is what you have in mind https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14565.
