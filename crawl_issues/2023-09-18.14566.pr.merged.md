**Labels**: `experimental`

This PR removes hard-coded built-in type definitions and introduces the `__builtin()` construct for explicitly registering them.

It also renames the `integer` class to `Integer` to resolve the ambiguity with the `integer` type.

### To do:
- [x] Builtin-types
- [x] Decide how to parse `__builtin()`

Since we decided to do type classes in a separate PR, this is now ready.

By the way, I originally imagined to get rid of the ``PrimitiveType`` enum entirely with this and to keep ``TypeSystem`` completely oblivious to the notion of primitive types - but looking at it again now, I agree that it's better to keep this around - it doesn't exactly *hurt* there either and the ``TypeSystemHelpers`` would become a pain, if we got rid of ``TypeSystem``s awareness of those types entirely.
So let's keep it like this!

I'd say it'd be nice to address https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14566#discussion_r1331516030, but then feel free to just merge this!
