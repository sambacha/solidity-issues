## Abstract

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->
Could we provide old doc style so that readers could choose which style they want?
## Motivation

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

As far as I know, we do not have plans to support the old style of the documentation page. Any reason to not use the current version?

The background is grey while the text is like purple, which means that the
text would not stand out as much as black against white

Hum...for me it does not show grey but pinkish/purplish. Have you tried to switch to the dark mode? However, we could definitely rethink the accessibility features of the page if needed. For that, you can open an issue describing your specific concerns on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website.
