This pull request enhances the documentation for Solidity's breaking changes in version 0.5.0 by adding examples that illustrate the changes in the `050-breaking-changes.rst` file. These examples are designed to help developers better understand the practical implications of these changes. The examples cover various aspects, such as variable declarations, syntax updates, and interoperability with older contracts.

**Changes Made:**

- Added examples to illustrate the changes introduced in Solidity version 0.5.0 in the `050-breaking-changes.rst` file.
- Ensured that the examples align with the specific changes listed in the documentation.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this pull request is to improve the clarity and comprehensibility of the breaking changes introduced in Solidity 0.5.0. By including practical examples, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how these changes affect their Solidity code.


**Additional Notes:**

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or further improvements to these examples. If there are specific areas that need further clarification or expansion, please let me know, and I will be happy to make the necessary adjustments.

Hi @Kayleexx, we appreciate your willingness to contribute, but the proposed added content is really redundant. The cases they aim to illustrate are very obvious and don't need examples.
Although this may not be the response you expected, I would like to suggest that you keep trying to contribute and discuss ideas about the language in the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org/).
