# [\#14573 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14573) `open`: Unable to invoke the Eldarica solver (SMTChecker)
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

By using solvers = [ 'eld' ] in the foundry.toml file, I get 'Warning (1218): CHC: Error trying to invoke SMT solver.' message. But eldarica is installed in my mac and accessible via the command eld in any folder.

## Environment

- Compiler version: solc 0.8.21
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry (forge 0.2.0)
- Operating system: macOS Monterey (12.6.8)

## Steps to Reproduce

Using this content in foundry.toml:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = "src"
out = "out"
libs = ["lib"]

# See more config options https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/config
[profile.default.model_checker]
engine = 'chc'
solvers = [ 'eld' ]
timeout = 0
targets = [
	"assert",
	"constantCondition",
	"divByZero",
	"outOfBounds",
	"overflow",
	"underflow"
]
invariants = [ 'contract' ]
showProved = true
showProvedSafe = true

[profile.default.model_checker.contracts]
'src/Monotonic.sol' = [ 'Monotonic' ]
```

After running this command line 'forge build --force', I get:

```
[⠢] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 16 files with 0.8.21
[⠆] Solc 0.8.21 finished in 8.49s
Compiler run successful with warnings:

  --> src/Monotonic.sol:12:9:
   |

   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Warning (5840): CHC: 2 verification condition(s) could not be proved. Enable the model checker option "show unproved" to see all of them. Consider choosing a specific contract to be verified in order to reduce the solving problems. Consider increasing the timeout per query.
```

For this example (found in SMTchecker documentation from https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/smtchecker.html:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity =0.8.21;

contract Monotonic {
    function f(uint x) internal pure returns (uint) {
        require(x < type(uint128).max);
        return x * 42;
    }

    function inv(uint a, uint b) public pure {
        require(b > a);
        assert(f(b) > f(a));
    }
}
```
Thanks!

Hi @acmLL, I did a quick test here and everything seems to work fine, however I'm on a linux machine, I don't have a macOS to test, I'm sorry. But the fact that it worked for me could be a sign that there is some problem with your eldarica installation. What is your eldarica version?

I tried your example with `solc` version `0.8.21` and `eldarica` version `2.0.9`.

Hey, @r0qs . Thanks for your reply. My Eldarica version is v2.0.9 as well. Maybe the problem is related to macOS. I read somewhere that Eldarica works fine in Linux, not with mac OS (The user has to compile solc from source to link with Eldarica...). But I thought that maybe this difficulty was already fixed for macOS. This is the reason I opened up this theme here... Best!

This is only true for z3 because it's used via the C++ API. Eldarica is used via a system's binary called `eld`, so I don't see why it shouldn't work on OSX, as long as that binary itself works, of course. Can you double check whether `eld` is in the system's `$PATH`?

Hey, @acmLL. you can fix it by installing the `z3` package or update `OS` version, unless of course you have an M1 chip, but the problem also lies in the `Mac OS` version, I don't know if it was done intentionally or not, but everyone has problems with version `12` now. For example, I have an Intel chip on my typewriter, so I can't install a new version of the operating system and installing the `z3` package didn't help me either
