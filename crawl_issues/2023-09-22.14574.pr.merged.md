> Did you properly think through the comment stating that the clearing doesn't need to be recursive here :-)?

Yeah, there's a docstring explaining the reasoning a few lines above:

```c++
	// All variables that reference variables to be cleared also have to be
	// cleared, but not recursively, since only the value of the original
	// variables changes. Example:
	// let a := 1
	// let b := a
	// let c := b
	// a := 2
	// add(b, c)
	// In the last line, we can replace c by b, but not b by a.
```

Which sounds reasonable. If you have a chain `e -> d -> c -> b -> a -> 1`, changing `a` only breaks the link to `a` and the `e -> d -> c -> b` part is still valid because none of those variables were directly changed and the links are (I assume) symbolic.

Before the PR the code was always clearing at least the variables and direct references. Only the second and higher layers of references were cleared inconsistently. That seems like it should not affect correctness. I.e. we may at most clear them unnecessarily and miss out on a valid optimization.
