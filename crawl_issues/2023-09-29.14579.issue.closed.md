## Abstract

Function pointers don't work with overloaded functions.

## Motivation

The current compiler doesn't recognize valid overloaded functions as candidates for function pointers. This limitation forces developers to use different function names *for the functions that have similar functionality*, which creates unnecessary code bulk. 

The compilation fails with the misleading message `TypeError: No matching declaration found after variable lookup.`. Even though the matching declaration is there. At least the error message may be a tiny bit more meaningful.

## Specification

Can't provide in-depth technical specification, however here is the code snipped that doesn't compile. 

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.21;

contract WontCompile {
    function deduce() external {
        bar(foo); // compilation fails due to this line
    }

    function foo(uint256) internal {}

    function foo(address) internal {}

    function bar(function(uint256) internal numFoo) internal {}
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Should not be backward incompatible.

<h1>Isuue : Function pointers don't work with overloaded functions</h1>
<p>
  <h2>Cause</h2>  In Solidity, it's not possible to directly pass functions as arguments to other functions without using function types or assigning them to variables. You need to define the function type or assign the function to a variable before passing it as an argument to another function. This is a limitation of the language.

I hope this solution helps you.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
