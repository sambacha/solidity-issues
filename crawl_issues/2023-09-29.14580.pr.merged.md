~Depends on #14585.~ Merged.

Isoltest prints "info" messages colored as errors. Apparently we missed that when we introduced the new level, probably because we still have very few such messages.

Now that #14510 is printing a lot of them, it's getting really annoying. This PR fix that and does some small refactors to prevent this getting out of sync so easily in the future.

Although I approved, I just noticed there are some conflicts.
