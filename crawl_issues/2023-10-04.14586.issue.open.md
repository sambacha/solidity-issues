## Abstract

Currently the JSON-based assembly output in Standard JSON is called `legacyAssembly`, which makes it seem deprecated. While that was the original intention, we moved away from that and we should rename it to make that clear.

## Motivation
Currently we have two assembly formats:
1. `assembly`/`--asm` (text)
1. `legacyAssembly`/`--asm-json`/`--combined-json asm` (JSON)

`legacyAssembly` was called that ever since Standard JSON was introduced.

@chriseth says that the legacy format was not machine-readable, and he wanted to remove it eventually. Though it's not certain if it was really the same as current legacy format (the non-machine-readable one was apparently text, not JSON). See also [comments from @chriseth and @axic on a related bug](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8171#issuecomment-588184845).

We're actively using the legacy JSON format for the assembly import feature that's being implemented (#13673) and it seems that if it had problems with ambiguity, those were resolved long ago. For this reason we decided to keep it after all.

## Specification

Make `"evm.assemblyJson"` a valid value for Standard JSON `outputSelection`.
- It should produce the same JSON output that `"evm.legacyAssembly"` does, but under a key called `assemblyJson`.


## Backwards compatibility
- `"evm.legacyAssembly"` should keep working exactly as it does now.
- Selecting `"*"` should not include `"evm.assemblyJson"` for now to avoid including the same, very verbose information twice or breaking the compatibility. We may change that in the future.
- Selecting both at the same time should be allowed.
