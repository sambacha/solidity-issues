    }
}
```

When the code above is optimized successively using `StackLimitEvader` (i.e., applied twice), the compiler throws.

Can this be reproduced by invoking the compiler or only by directly running that part of the optimizer twice? What is the exact error?

I tried this, but it compiles the code just fine for me on 0.8.21:

```bash
solc test.yul --strict-assembly --optimize --ir-optimized |
    grep --invert-match "=======" |
    grep --invert-match "Pretty printed source:" |
    solc - --strict-assembly --optimize
```

Same when I use a build from the current `develop` (b54e7207739e48c5a7712a4683a9591a6c64b7cd).

I can only reproduce it by directly running the stack limit evader twice (minus the second disambiguation i.e., disambiguate and then run stack limit evader twice). See for reference:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b54e7207739e48c5a7712a4683a9591a6c64b7cd/test/libyul/YulOptimizerTestCommon.cpp#L335-L342

The error is that invalid Yul is produced. Throws from here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b54e7207739e48c5a7712a4683a9591a6c64b7cd/libyul/AsmAnalysis.cpp#L97

Hmm... I wonder if the evader even guarantees not to break the properties it requires. If running `g` or `hgfo` steps in between the two evader runs helps then it probably doesn't.

In any case, I don't think this is something a user can do (not even via a custom sequence). What kind of scenario are you fuzzing?

I guess the idea is to fuzz individual optimizer steps to make sure custom optimizer sequences are fine - and the stack limit evader just also made it into the mix as regular step, even though it can never be manually run.

I wonder why this would throw, though - is the ``CompilabilityChecker`` run separately for both invocations? If not, that'd be sufficient cause for a crash - otherwise, I'd actually expect it to be stable on reinvocation (even though it's not crucial).

[But it's not a step - it's still hard-coded](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp#L195-L212). We even did the whole cleanup sequence thing to avoid it being a step.

That was my point with the "even though" :-).

The compilability checker is run separately for both invocations.
