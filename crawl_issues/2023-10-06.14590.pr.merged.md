# [\#14590 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14590) `merged`: Consistent severity and color for CLI error messages
**Labels**: `refactor`

Currently errors reported directly by `CommandLineInterface` are just plain text, not styled consistently with the ones from the error reporter. This makes the warning I need to add in #14475 somewhat hard to notice. I decided to refactor it to make the style consistent.
