@matheusaaguiar My plan is to eventually close #14578 and instead redo it on top of #14721. I think it would be best to rebase your PR on `newAnalysis` instead if you want to continue working on it. It does not really depend heavily on my PR (the changes in `TypeClassMemberRegistration` just need to be moved to `TypeInference`). I suggested doing it on top of it because I expected that it would be merged quickly and spare us some conflicts, but it won't happen without merging several other dependency PRs first so probably no point for you to wait for that.

Since we closed #14578, this one should be closed too.
