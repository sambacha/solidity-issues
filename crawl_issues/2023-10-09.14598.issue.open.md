- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--

Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
interface A {
    enum Z{
        Y
    }
    
    struct X{
        Z z;
    }
}

interface B is A{
    enum W{
        V
    }

    struct U{
        W w;
        Z z;
        X x;
}

contract C {
    function D (uint8 a) public pure returns(B.X) {
        return B.Z(a);
    }
    
    function E (B.X b) public pure returns(bool) {
        return b == B.Z.Y;
    }
    
    function F (B.Z c) public pure returns(B.Y memory) {
        return B.X(c);
    }
    
    function G (B.Z d) public pure returns(B.Y memory) {
        return B.Z(B.Z.Y, B.X(d));
    }
    
    function G (B.Z d) public pure returns(B.Y memory) {
        return B.U(B.W.V,, B.Z.Y, B.X(d));
    }
}
```
```
TypeError: Member "Z" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(contract B).

Or, I think this is restricted from the cause of the below.
Enable Enums to be Extended in Upgradeable Contracts [#9986](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9986)

This is another topic, it looks good to expand the enum type from inheriting or redefining from an upgrade.
