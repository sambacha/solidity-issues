# [\#14606 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14606) `closed`: Fixed type variables in function definitions in experimental analysis
**Labels**: `has dependencies`, `experimental`

Part of #14570.
Depends on #14635.

The PR introduces fixed free type variables and implements unification for them. Then replaces generic variables with fixed ones in a function definition once it's processed. It does not yet use fixed type variables for anything else.

Currently the PR breaks the `type_classes.sol` test case:

```solidity
Error: Cannot unify "b:type and 'k:type.
  --> test/libsolidity/semanticTests/experimental/type_class.sol:10:5:
   |
10 |     function new() -> Self;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

I think I need to replace the `polymorphicInstance()` call used on discovered type class functions with variable generalization. Or maybe the class variable should become a fixed variable?

Problem with the type class variable solved by making it a fixed type variable.

The remaining issue is that now this obviously won't unify with the concrete type used in the instantiation. I guess I have to do what I do for functions, that is, turn it into a generic variable before unification. The only complication is that it has to be a specific generic variable - the same one that was used to replace type class variable used in function definitions of that class.

Reading the PR and thinking through more implications for codegen, I actually increasingly think that it may be the better choice to just mark type variables as fixed in the type environment after all - we should talk about that.

@ekpyron I just pushed a cleaned up current state of the PR. Some of the other stuff I had in my branch went into #14635 and trivial stuff as fixups into #14510.

So currently I need to solve this problem with the type variable in polymorphic types ending up generalized and failing function type comparison when I'm processing instantiations. Then replace `fixTypeVariables()` with unification. I expect that to finally be enough to pass tests and be mergeable. Though TBH I've been at that point several times now and each time I end up discovering something new that I need to adjust to keep the other changed things working :)

By now, I'm quite convinced that the current attempt of introducing ``FixedTypeVariable`` as a new variant in ``Type`` is the wrong approach for this.

We should, instead, add a set of fixed type variables to ``TypeEnvironment``. I.e. we keep it at one and the same ``TypeVariable`` and the ``TypeEnvironment`` can have some of them declared as *fixed* (changing the unification behaviour, which is already handled by the ``TypeEnvironment``).

That means, that type checking a function can remain exactly the same as before, just at the end of the function you *fix* the types, by just adding the type variables involved in the function's signature to the set of fixed type variables in the global ``TypeEnvironment``.

Then generalizing also remains fully identical to the current ``fresh``ening.

And whenever you want to temporarily unify anything that is fixed (for example for unification during code generation) you can just create a new ``TypeEnvironment`` that does *not* have the variables in question marked as fixed.
(Don't worry about the fact that cloning type environments is an expensive operation at the moment, that can be implemented differently easily - same for the cost of resolving or unifying - neither will ever be a bottleneck.)

Conversely, if you want to declare a fixed type variable, you can just introduce them as the one-and-the-same-kind of ``TypeVariable``, but just immediately mark them as fixed in the type environment.

It's a bit unfortunate that we spent some time on the other approach of introducing a completely separate kind of type variable, but that's normal for working on experimental stuff and moving the distinction to the ``TypeEnvironment`` has only advantages.

ok then. I'll put this PR on hold and switch to the approach with the type environment.

I think we'll still benefit from the time I spent on this because a lot of it went into trying to understand how things work and also getting some relevant tests that will tell me when I'm breaking something that's supposed to already work. So it should be quicker this time.

Just a correction for anyone reading the comments on this PR, it was closed in favor of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14655.
