When Solidity is used as a series of libraries, we don't need to build those command line tools. Not only because it's waste of time, but it also prevents linking libboostoptions.a, which can cause some issues under certain circumstances.

What I really want is stripping those libboostxxx.a when linking my program, so I added this option to exclude targets that depend on those libraries. However, I still observe these .a show up after this change... So yeah it's not what I want so I'm gonna close this. Thank you!
