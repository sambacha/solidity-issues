Only took a cursory look, but I think you're missing tests in `test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp` and `test/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp`.

edit: Actually, perhaps not CommandLineParser since the option is already there.

Good point. The option is there in the `CommandLineParser` tests, but not for the assembler mode. I will add it ;)

About the `CommandLineInterface` tests, I guess it is not needed, is it? There is already command-line tests to check the output. Or do you mean to add a unit test for the `collectYulSourceIndices`?

@r0qs fix the changelog, and I'll approve.

@cameel  I think I addressed now everything except https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14612#discussion_r1483457495 - lets really just do it in a separate PR. So lets do a final review! I will squash the commits after that.

Sorry, I just saw now that the the tests where failing here. Will fix that.

Ok, I guess there is still one thing: I just noticed that the assembly json is always generated, even if it was not requested. I guess this need to be changed and then this PR should be ready.
