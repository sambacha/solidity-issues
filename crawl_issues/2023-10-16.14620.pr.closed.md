I just rebased this on top of the current state of `newAnalysis`.

As for the syntax tests failing on ``test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/experimental/builtin/builtin_type_definition.sol``: that's not an issue of this PR, but of the test itself.
It's generally invalid to declare a variable of type ``void`` as done in ``let v:void`` there, so we should change the test.
We could either remove that variable from the test or change it to a function - ``let v:void->void`` should be fine.

In a separate PR we can then at some point extend analysis to produce proper errors on declaring variables of types without stack representation, but that's out of scope for this PR.

Also, now I'm asserting instead of throwing a error as suggested here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14620#discussion_r1472815686 so tests that test will also fail because of the integer declaration:  `let i: integer;` or should this also be a function?
