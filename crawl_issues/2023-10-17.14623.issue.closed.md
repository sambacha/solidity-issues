# [\#14623 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14623) `closed`: Assigning private function to a function pointer of an internal type
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49505964?v=4" width="50">[msm-mdmahbubur-rahman](https://github.com/msm-mdmahbubur-rahman) opened issue at [2023-10-17 07:44](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14623):

In Solidity documentation, I found the below information:
**A function of an internal type can be assigned to a variable of an internal function type regardless of where it is defined. This includes **private**, internal and public functions of both contracts and libraries as well as free functions. External function types, on the other hand, are only compatible with public and external contract functions.**

Here private function of a contract or from library if assigned to a function pointer of internal type, will lead to a compilation error.

Example:

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    contract MyContract {
    uint privateData = 42;

    function internalFunction() internal {
        // This is an internal function within MyContract
        privateData = 100;
    }
    function privateFunction() private {
        // This is a private function within MyContract
        privateData = 200;
    } }
    contract FunctionPointerExample {
        // Attempting to assign a private function to a function pointer. This will result in a compilation error
        function () internal internalFunc = MyContract.privateFunction;
     }

    }
}

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
