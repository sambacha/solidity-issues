# [\#14635 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14635) `merged`: Adjust `polymorphicInstance()`
**Labels**: `experimental`

The PR addresses https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#discussion_r1363755155 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#discussion_r1363752412.

We discussed this last week on the call - `unifyGeneralized()` was a part of some idea that was not fully realized in the end and all we really need is just a call to `TypeEnvironment::fresh()`. That's what `polymorphicInstance()` does now.

The PR also adds some tests covering the uses of `fresh()` and `polymorphicInstances()`. This shows that the PR does not break things both here and with my subsequent changes in #14606.

The funny thing is: the last thing I did before pushing the prototype was to do the exact opposite :-) - i.e. to introduce ``polymorphicInstance`` in the first place in order to isolate the occurrances of ``fresh()`` to make it easier to replace them by a mechanism accounting for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14606

Why would it be any easier to replace `polymorphicInstance()` than to replace `fresh()`?

The point was to collect all instances of refreshening for the purpose of generating a polymorphic schema of a global definition and then checking what's left.

Also: producing a freshened type is a technical operation on the type - producing a polymorphic instance of a global type scheme is a semantic description of what's happening.

Based on that I'd actually not remove it. (Removing the entire function that gives the operation that happens here a descriptive name is quite different from removing the additional type variable it unnecessarily introduces :-))

`polymorphicInstance()` restored.

I need reapproval. Only pushed a small stylistic tweak.

Before we merge new changes, we first need to clean up the mess in the base branch.

I wanted to merge this already, but in that case maybe I should still change it before I do?

No hurry, just bringing up the option.
