Correct, they were generated using the binaries you mention.

Would be grateful if you could make a PR with the documentation change that helped you compile the fuzzers :pray:

I have a few more questions and would appreciate your assistance in addressing them.
(1) When using `solc_ossfuzz` to fuzz, the generated program will have syntax errors. "What is the strategy behind the generated code, and why are there syntax errors?
![3BB90904-BAAC-407a-B409-91786173B1F8](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/assets/147013944/daa05cfa-629c-4100-a759-8c426726493e)
(2) Why the outputs of `solc_mutator_ossfuzz` are not solidity(eg: ). But the files in `solc_mutator_ossfuzz_seed_corpus`(https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-fuzzing-corpus/tree/master) are solidity.

The fuzzer is randomly mutating bytes, so syntax errors are expected. One strategy is to use a fuzzing dictionary with language keywords with the hope that random mutations with these keywords eventually leads to sane code.

> Why the outputs of solc_mutator_ossfuzz are not solidity(eg: ). But the files in solc_mutator_ossfuzz_seed_corpus(https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-fuzzing-corpus/tree/master) are solidity.

The outputs of solc_mutator_ossfuzz are in a test format recognised by an internal testing tool called `isoltest`, hence the prefix. The files in the said directory are solidity simply because I copied them from the other corpus. There is no good reason for this.

What about sol_proto_ossfuzz, how does it generate the initial protobuf grammar, and what strategy is employed in its generation? What does its output signify? I am only aware that the protobuf grammar is transformed into Solidity, followed by testing.
```
contracts {
  i {
    bases {
      bases {
        funcdef {
          mut: NONPAYABLE
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
test {
  type: LIBRARY
}
seed: 0
```

Glad to discuss further. However, this issue is perhaps not the best place for it :)

Do you mind closing this issue if you are satisfied with the outcome (documentation update)?

Sure. Thank you very much.
