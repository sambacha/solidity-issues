This is the cause of and thereby fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14640.

It's present ever since the introduction of ``verbatim`` in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11123.

The hard question here will be to evaluate what effects this can possibly have and thereby what severity to assign to it.

In principle, a test would be nice :-). Rather surprised that @cameel didn't cry out for one :-).
We can merge it without if we don't have the time before the release, but would still be nice to have.

Yeah, definitely should have a test. How did I miss that :P

I'm not entirely sure what kind of test would work best here. Maybe an ``test/libyul/objectCompiler`` test with an enabled optimizer preset and a switch like in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14640 should do it?

The test needs to start from something with ``verbatim``, so Yul... and run compilation down to evmasm assembly through the libevmasm optimizer... I think apart from the `objectCompiler` tests, it'd have to be a command line test - but ``test/libyul/objectCompiler`` with `optimizationPreset : standard` should work!

We could do what I did in #14574 and [create a script-based CLI test](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14574/files#diff-15e1a6fbee03546d8c00bd79fe5e503bc169bca629a2c7b6bc28fa837e02899c). The test could have an example with two different patterns in `verbatim` (long enough to be unlikely to occur naturally) and grep the bytecode to check that both are present.

I guess an `objectCompiler` test would work too, though with a little higher risk that when updating it in the future (due to unrelated bytecode changes) we won't even notice when the output no longer is what it should be. But this kind of test has the advantage that it shows you the assembly, which is why in #14574 I included one anyway.

I can't approve this, since I'm the original author - but let this comment count as an approval and feel free to approve and merge once CI passes.
