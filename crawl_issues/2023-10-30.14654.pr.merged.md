# [\#14654 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14654) `merged`: Use type class as a sort for its type variable
**Labels**: `has dependencies`, `experimental`

Depends on #14635 (could be independent, but I want to be sure it passes its tests).

Extracted from #14606. Adds each type class to the sort of its type variable.

I just noticed that we actually give the type class variable the right sort through unification:

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/5f43e3542739690c17d6154fb7f3ee8d76d93b35/libsolidity/experimental/analysis/TypeInference.cpp#L243

So maybe this PR is superfluous. I created it because I was initially having problems when visiting instantiations due to this class being missing. But maybe that was just something spurious, due to using not fully resolved type or something. I'll need to check if it makes any difference in the PRs on top of it that are now finished.

Still, we don't do this for builtin classes, only for user-defined ones, so maybe part of it is still useful. At least as long as we have those builtin classes.
