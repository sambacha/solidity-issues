# [\#14655 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14655) `merged`: Fixed type variables for functions, type classes and types in new analysis
**Labels**: `experimental`

Part of #14570.
~Depends on #14654.~ Merged.
Replaces #14606.

This is the new approach, as described in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14606#issuecomment-1775746741. Ended up being more concise and does not have the problem I stopped at in the other PR (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14606#pullrequestreview-1693105120). I actually did not have to do anything to generalize variables because refreshing done by `polymorphicInstance()` deals with that.

This is probably done, since it passes all my new tests, and the new approach should not really cause problems in the codegen.

Looks like [`chk_spelling` does not like some patterns in `DebugWarner`'s messages](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/31673/workflows/1c8e946f-912f-47b5-9b51-97d43fce5ff9/jobs/1413707):

```
./test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/experimental/inference/polymorphic_type_abs_and_rep.sol:62: bu ==> by
./test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/experimental/inference/polymorphic_type_abs_and_rep.sol:63: bu ==> by
```

In this case it's triggered by `T(?bu:type)`:
```solidity
// Info 4164: (220-228): Inferred type: T(?bu:type)
// Info 4164: (220-225): Inferred type: U(string) -> T(?bu:type)
```

Weird, because I'd expect that to be a problem in earlier PRs as well but it only started complained here. Might have something to do with the use of `?` as a prefix (that's the main thing that changed).

I extended the PR to handle fixing type variables in type definitions as well (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14570#issuecomment-1788866074).
