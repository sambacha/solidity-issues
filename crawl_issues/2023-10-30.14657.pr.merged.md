Without looking through this fully: how exactly does this bypass the fact that we don't enter the sequence to metadata if ``runYulOptimiser`` is ``false``? I'd expect to see some change accounting for that (i.e. in ``CompilerStack::createMetadata``), but I don't on a quick glance.

> Right, good catch, it doesn't. `createMetadata()` will skip the sequence when `runYulOptimiser` is `false` and this will result in metadata not recreating the bytecode. This needs to be fixed before we can merge the PR.

This was [implemented](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14657/commits/ec90ea0b1c42cb46edb8e948778e47bfaa391058) this morning though.
