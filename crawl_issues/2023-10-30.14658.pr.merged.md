**Labels**: `experimental`

Moved here from my fixups into `newAnalysis`:
1. [Two `Function` types being created, instead of `Function` and `Itself`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#pullrequestreview-1650886537).
1. [`resolveRecursive()` not resolving type variables](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#discussion_r1358883716).
1. [`index()` being used on the `Type` variant rather than `TypeVariable`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#pullrequestreview-1674931569)
    - Should were rename `index` to `id`? The current name seems very prone to this kind of error.
1. [Sorts being printed twice by `DebugWarner`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#pullrequestreview-1677322514).
1. [Unnecessary sort comparison in `unify()` - should have been an assert.](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14510#pullrequestreview-1664238270)
1. `uint64_t` instead of `size_t` used for the index in `TypeEnvironment::fresh()`.
    - This is the only use I found and it's `size_t` everywhere else. This is part of compiler output though, so a portable type like `uint64_t` is probably a better choice though. Should we switch?

> Yeah, these are all very much uncontroversial and we agreed on more or less all of them before, so I didn't even expect them to be pulled out again - fine to merge these back in :-)

Well, I thought you wanted all of the fixups removed from the base branch :)
