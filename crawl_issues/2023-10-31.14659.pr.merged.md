By the way, I'm not really sure the segfaults in CLI tests are caused by accessing the missing annotations. Looking at CLI tests, `~soljson_via_fuzzer` is the only one that crashes.

Looking at [`t_ubu_cli` run on one of my PRs](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/31863/workflows/1035d120-7dc0-410b-bea9-03a9c43680d5/jobs/1423116):

It does manage to run some test cases before segfaulting. IMO it's very possible that the segfault actually happens inside the experimental analysis. And regardless of that, even when we fix the segfault, we'll still have to deal with the ICEs - it's very easy to run into them in experimental and I don't think fuzzing it is viable at this point. Perhaps we should just exclude `semanticTests/experimental/` and `syntaxTests/experimental/` from the fuzzer test?

Same with bytecode tests - we don't request any exotic outputs in those, so IMO those might be segfaulting somewhere in new analysis as well. So here again, excluding experimental tests may be the way to go. Or debugging the segfaults. But the asserts added here may in the end not be enough to track them.

Is there still any reason for this being a draft :-)?

Not at all. I started it as a draft and forgot to change to ready.
