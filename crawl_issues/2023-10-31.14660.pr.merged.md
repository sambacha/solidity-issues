# [\#14660 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14660) `merged`: Patch codegen issues enough to make tests pass in experimental analysis
**Labels**: `experimental`

Merging this should let us finally get rid of the hack that disables the codegen in syntax tests. Note that the codegen won't actually run until we remove the hack commit from `newAnalysis` branch.

The PR patches two issues that prevent all current test cases from pass through codegen successfully:
1. `builtin_type_definition.sol`: Calls via function pointers seem unimplemented. I added a proper `solUnimplementedAssert()` against that.
1. `import_and_call_stdlib_function.sol`: Codegen unconditionally assigns function result to a variable even if the function does not return anything (which is invalid Yul). Added an `if` to skip that for functions without return parameters.

These are not proper fixes, but should be good enough until we address the issues properly. Especially the second one should be addressed by #14620.

Argh, looks like I somehow missed `semanticTests/experimental/type_class.sol`. That one is failing too so going back to draft until I address that.

Looks like it's because the new-style not only have a separate return parameter list but the original list is no longer populated. So `returnParameterList()` is always empty and I should have used  `experimentalReturnExpression()` instead. Should work now.
