Creating again because https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14053 cannot be reopened.

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13943

We're doing a few things here regarding the default values for the model checker settings:

- Timeout has a default value of 1 second now. The `SMTCheckerTests` still need to use the old `rlimit` for reproducibility, which is done by overriding the timeout value in the settings
- Only assertions are checked by default. The others need to be enabled explicitly, as already was the case for overflow and underflow.
- If Eldarica is the chosen solver and the user has not explicitly set a value for divModNoSlacks we automatically make it true because that works better for Eldarica.

TODO:

- [ ] There is an issue with emscripten that causes the statically compiled z3 wasm build to not work with threads when linked to soljson, so the timeout option will **not** be available  for z3 && emscripten. We still need to disable that.
- [ ] Adjust docs accordingly based on the item above
- [ ] Adjust solc version in docs
- [ ] Changelog
