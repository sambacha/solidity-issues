**Labels**: `experimental`

~Depends on #14655.~ Merged.
Fixes #14570.

This PR introduces the new `forall` quantifier, which can be used to declare type variables used by a function.

Currently it's usable only on free functions. We may want to consider using it for types and instantiations as well, but those already allow declaring variables and I did not touch their syntax. We may also want to allow it inside blocks to get let-polymorphism, but that's also out of scope of this PR.

Having the quantifier, we can start requiring declarations for all type variables. Thanks to this it is now possible to refer to existing type variables and also use type variables in function return types.

I think that this PR with dependencies now covers everything mentioned in #14570.

Some jobs are failing, but this does not seem related to the PR. Looks like #14839 might not have fixed everything.

Well, this is lame; looks like the image used in this PR has a different version of Python

```
circleci@packer-651dab20-1061-caa7-7f59-31ffa2e7d7e2  ~
$ which python
/c/Python311/python
```

It's 311 instead of 312, so obviously can't find the binary to symlink since it doesn't exist.

Hmmm... so I guess CircleCI has multiple different versions of the Windows image and they assign them randomly to CI runs? This would also explain why miniconda just suddenly disappeared without us touching the config.

If that's the case, we might be best off just doing #14847 right away to get rid of the hard-coded path.

Agreed.
