Feature request #14669 

+ Added `INSTALL_INTERNAL_LIBS` options(default OFF). If turned on, internal libs will be installed under configured locations.  
+ Added `cmake/FindSolidity.cmake` so that Solidity can be linked as a dependency by external projects.
+ To properly link built libraries, external projects should have the same compiler & linker configurations as is configured in `cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake`

Thanks for your PR review and yeah, installing dep headers is indeed a bad practice just to make internal modules work as imported targets. My lab is working on a project which basically compiles Solidity sources into Petri Net, then do validations(eg. concurrency safety analysis) with our own Petri Net test framework. The main use cases involved are as such: 
- Lexing and parsing Solidity sources with CompilerStack.
- Implementing our own ASTVisitor and ASTConstVisitor classes for code emitting, etc...
- Using modules such as FileReader as our base IO components

Alright - for that purpose and since there is no reasonable way to install these internal headers without polluting the system with dependency headers, I'd say the only way to achieve it is to work off the source tree directly (respectively with the solidity compiler as a git submodule or such).

Direct CMake installation support, we could only provide for the limited C interface in ``libsolc`` (sorry, I misunderstood the context and thought that was at question here).

So given that, I'll go ahead and close the PR, sorry about the confusion.
