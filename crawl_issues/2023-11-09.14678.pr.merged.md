# [\#14678 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14678) `merged`: Make JS version of bytecode report indicate progress on stdout to prevent CI timeouts
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

This addresses the issue of [`b_bytecode_ems-via-ir-optimize` timing out](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/31770/workflows/54cbef20-50ed-4b79-a86e-df23d522b25a/jobs/1418789) during releases. Also, makes its output and parameters more consistent with the Python version.

I considered also changing it to iterate over files in the current dir like the Python script does to make the invocation even more similar, but the annoying issue with that is the sorting order - `readdirSync()` does not guarantee any particular order while Bash `*` does. Interestingly, the order was still the same on my machine when I tried it, but I'm not sure we can rely on it.

I'll just leave the diff of that change here in case we decide we do want it:
```diff
@ scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.js:32 @ function cleanString(string)
     return (string !== '' ? string : undefined)
 }

-let inputFiles = []
 let stripSMTPragmas = false
 let presets = []
 let reportFilePath = undefined
@ scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.js:60 @ for (let i = 2; i < process.argv.length; ++i)
         ++i;
     }
     else
-        inputFiles.push(process.argv[i])
+        throw Error("Invalid argument: " + process.argv[i])
 }

 if (reportFilePath === undefined)
@ scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.js:79 @ for (const preset of presets)
 {
     settings = SETTINGS_PRESETS[preset]

-    for (const filename of inputFiles)
-    {
+    fs.readdirSync(".").filter(filename => filename.endsWith('.sol')).forEach((filename) => {
         let input = {
             language: 'Solidity',
             sources: {
@ scripts/bytecodecompare/prepare_report.js:165 @ for (const preset of presets)
                     reportFile.write(filename + ':' + contractName + ' ' + metadata + '\n')
                     process.stdout.write(progressIndicator)
                 }
-    }
+    })
 }
```

I guess you could use `sort()` to sort it alphabetically or even passing an anonymous function with the sorting logic to mimic the Bash sorting, but the current way is fine by me. E.g.
```js
fs.readdirSync(".").sort().filter(filename => filename.endsWith('.sol')).forEach((filename) => {
```

I could, but then I'd have to do that in both scripts in a way that ensures the sort is indeed the same (it can be affected by locale), which is a hassle. I just did not want to do it in this PR, so I stopped as soon as I realized that I don't really need this change to add an extra parameter :) We could do it on another occasion.
