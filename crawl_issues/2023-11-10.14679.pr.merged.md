Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/717. This will only be possible when we merge that PR in solc-js.

FYI, I'm fine with merging this if @r0qs and @cameel agree that it's good :-). We just need to be extra careful in double-checking what comes out of this in the next release.

Just note that https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/717 is not merged yet due to breakage caused by Hardhat's update to pnpm. Which should be fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/pull/719, but we need to push both of these through before we can merge this checklist update.

Well, I just reviewed @r0qs fix and it's great and my PR also rebased on it without issues. So I merged it all and now we can also merge this.
