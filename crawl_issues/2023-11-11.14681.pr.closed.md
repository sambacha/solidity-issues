Hi @molecula451, the PR looks good, but unfortunately, our `breaking` branch has not been kept up to date for quite a while now, and until we get it up to scratch, we'll not be accepting any breaking changes, so I'll close the PR. Once we fix the base branch (`breaking`), I'll ping you and we can re-open this PR.

Sorry again, I know this is the second PR you've opened regarding the dropping of `--opcodes`.

the branch is available in the fork so that when reopen happens
