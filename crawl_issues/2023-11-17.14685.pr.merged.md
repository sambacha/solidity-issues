Explanation on 1 argument `bytes.concat` call:
1. If the argument is of type `bytes memory`: `bytes.concat` call is defined as value of the argument.
2. If the argument is of other type: fixed bytes, etc, `bytes.concat` is defined as a function (just as 2+ arguments calls)

Maybe it could be done differently, but I would have to cast values of types fixed bytes, string literals to values of type `bytes memory`

Hey @pgebal the two tests failing seems to be due to out of memory in the CI jobs: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/31908/workflows/a54b0a16-fb08-4f77-989d-13a1bebba3b2/jobs/1425767/resources. If there is no memory leak in the current implementation, and the memory increase is expected, you may need to increase the `resource_class` of the job, which, by the way, is already using a large image, i.e. [base_ubuntu2204_large](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L1173C3-L1173C3).

@r0qs Thanks, I noticed that too. I am not sure about the memory increase caused by my changes. I asked @leonardoalt to have a look on this code. Maybe he can find something suspicious here. If Leo thinks it seems right I'll increase `resource class` to see if that helps.

Done, I updated the main PR note.

Looks good! It looks like the coding style is wrong somewhere

@pgebal You have to update test expectations for the test where you changed the indentation.
Also you can now update the main description of the PR again, since the test is no longer deleted.
