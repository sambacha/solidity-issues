You may be onto something here; none of the steps you're using have hard prerequisites (although omitting a hard prerequisite should yield a different ICE). Now, the interesting thing is that using the `Rematerializer` step (`m`) has no effect on the produced Yul code after the `SSATransform` (`a`), so using the `am` sequence is equivalent to just using `a` by itself. Also, running it with `as` works just fine as well, so my assumption is that running the `Rematerializer` step in this case messes up the tracking in `DataFlowAnalyzer`, which is also a dependency for the `ExpressionSimplifier`. I'd say it's worth investigating, but a confirmation from @ekpyron or @chriseth would be nice.

Let me actually bump this to medium impact... there is something off with for-loop scoping here. The culprit here is the expression simplifier. If you just run it alone on the following:

```
{
    {
        let a := 0
        for { } true { a := add(a, 2) }
        {
            if iszero(lt(a, 4)) { break }
            let a_4 := a
            mstore(0, a_4)
            a := add(a_4, 1)
        }
    }
}
```

it'll generate

```
{
    {
        let a := 0
        for { } true { a := add(a_4, 3) }
        {
            if iszero(lt(a, 4)) { break }
            let a_4 := a
            mstore(0, a_4)
            a := add(a_4, 1)
        }
    }
}
```

ignoring that ``a_4`` isn't in scope in the for-loop post.

Actually, surprising that this doesn't occur more often in practice - not sure what prevents it from happening in the default sequence. But it's, in any case, comparably harmless: the underlying issue is that the data flow analyzer only clears knowledge about *assigned* variables in the for-loop body, but probably should also do so for *declared* ones in the case of for-loops (which are handled specially due to their weird scoping, but currently don't seem to account for this case)... but from what I can tell this can only ever result in malformed Yul code, never in semantically invalid code.

Small update: The fuzzer managed to reproduce this using an existing test case: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/loopInvariantCodeMotion/no_move_memory.yul

Repro

```
solc --strict-assembly --optimize --yul-optimizations "s:" test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/loopInvariantCodeMotion/no_move_memory.yul
```
