solc-bin depends on [swarmhash](https://github.com/axic/swarmhash), which depends on [keccakjs](https://github.com/axic/keccakjs), which depends on [sha3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sha3). [sha3 fails to build on node.js > 16](https://github.com/axic/keccakjs/issues/13). Now that [node.js 16 has reached EOL](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol), distros like Arch Linux are dropping that version and it starts being more and more of a hindrance in our release process. Recalculating hashes locally requires workarounds like running the `update` script in a Docker image.

I reported the issues in keccakjs a long time ago (https://github.com/axic/keccakjs/issues/13) but they were not fixed so far. There's also a [PR to switch swarmhash](https://github.com/axic/swarmhash/pull/5) to the actively maintained [keccak](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keccak) package, which would be an even better way to solve the issue. I pinged @axic in the PR, and there's a chance it will get merged. If not, we'll have to look for an alternative. I'm preemptively creating an issue for it here so that we can track it on the focus board.

Maybe we should also consider dropping the swarm hashes altogether from the file list. AFAIK solc-bin is not hosted on Swarm anyway and the project has gone through significant changes over the years, which may have even invalidated those hashes. We should check if having these hashes there still makes sense.

Posted by @r0qs on the channel:
> Hey, just a heads up, we will need to update nodejs version in solc-bin to version 20.0 by April (so probably for the next release), since it is reaching its end of life: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/
Also, this means that we will need to probably change the `sha3` library we have being using there and in solc-js
