> Looks good already - can you also check if there's a new version of evmc/evmone we need to update to? I think the latest one should have decent cancun support (including transient storage), but haven't checked, if we're up to date with it.

We are using the latest evmone release, i.e. `0.10.0`, and support for cancun was added in the master branch and not released yet. Also, they updated evmc to `11.0.0` on the master branch as well. So, we should update our CI to use the master branch instead of `v0.10.0` branch. I will do that in another PR ;)

Are you sure? I thought Andrej said at some point that they already had it - but maybe he just meant merged on master, not released - can you ping them (maybe in our EOF channels), though, about when to expect a release? Maybe they'll release very soon, then we don't need to switch to a git build for it everywhere.

Yes, exactly. It has been merged into the master branch but has not been released yet (https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/releases). However, considering that evmc was updated to version 11.0.0 today (https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/commit/ecc83d9f50791890968f708368d1e488c6e60294), they might indeed release it soon.

I took a look at our current evmone build scripts, and it seems we'll need to modify the Windows and MacOS scripts to build from source instead of downloading the binaries. So, it might be worthwhile to wait for a bit.

> This PR could also already add an entry to the [Target Options](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#target-options) list under `Using the Compiler` section in the docs. But that's optional and could be done in the future. Other than that, everything looks ok and according to what was done before when introducing shanghai.

I guess it is better to add the entry to the Target Options in the branch that implements transient storage, because this one here does not add any opcodes for example.

I just did a simple ``git grep shanghai`` check to double-check that this PR covers everything - I haven't gone through the entire list, but at least ``docs/using-the-compiler.rst`` should mention it - any reason not to include it there just yet?

It might be the only thing missing, but better to double-check :-).

Yes, I didn't add it for the same reason of this comment: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14705#issuecomment-1834128264, because this PR does nothing besides only add the Cancun EVM version compiler option. I thought it would make more sense to add the docs with the actual implementation of it. But I can change that and already try to add some details about transient storage.
