## Description: Solidity compiler produces incorrect bytecode - The semantics of the program are inconsistent after compilation.

- Affected Versions: Nearly all (found to affect all versions from v0.6+ in testing).

- Affected Projects: Unknown (This issue can be found in test cases. Any thoroughly tested project should not be affected by this issue).

- Description: During the Solidity compilation process, the compiler alters the original semantics of the program, causing it not to execute as expected.

## Environment

- Compiler version: Nearly all
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): shanghai and more

## Steps to Reproduce


```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
pragma solidity ^0.8;

contract test {
    mapping(uint256 => bool) public map;

    constructor() {
        map[1] = true;
        map[2] = true;
    }

    function tryClean(uint256 key) private returns (bool) {
        if (map[key]) {
            map[key] = false;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    function step_1() public returns (bool) {
        // clean <1> and <2>
        if (tryClean(1) == false && tryClean(2) == false) {
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    function step_2() public view returns (bool) {
        // check if data cleaned
        return ((map[1] == false) && (map[2] == false));
    }
}
```

In the `step_1` function, when using `&&`, the original intention expects both expressions to execute. However, it is incorrectly optimized by the compiler to:

```solidity
if (tryClean(1) == true || tryClean(2) == true) {
    return true;
}
return false;
```

This leads to the execution differing from the original intent.

Note: The compiler, when optimizing code, should ensure semantic consistency and consider whether the `tryClean` function internally modifies the state with opcodes such as sstore, mstore, call, logN, create, revert, etc.

Hello, I have also found the problem you raised in practice. Will this problem have a larger impact and cause more serious mistakes？

My previous error stemmed from not carefully examining the code. Upon my second check, I found no issues. So, this problem does not exist, and it won't have any other impact.

Then I have a question. We know that solidity has a logic short circuit optimization method. If you add some code about contract transfer to the `tryClean` function in your example, will it be optimized and have an impact?
