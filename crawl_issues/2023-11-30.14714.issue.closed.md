## Abstract

Currently this code will result in compilation error:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

type CustomUint is uint256;

interface IMath {
    function add(uint256 x, uint256 y) external pure returns (uint256);
}

contract Math is IMath {
    function add(CustomUint x, CustomUint y) external pure override returns (CustomUint) {
        return CustomUint.unwrap(x) + CustomUint.unwrap(y);
    }
}
```

## Motivation

During function signature generation, user-defined types are getting compiled into their underlying types, so it would make sense to allow overloading interfaces using primitive types with user-defined types with the same underlying.

## Backwards Compatibility

It will not cause any breaking changes
