**Labels**: `experimental`

Depends on #14668.
Replaces #14578.

This PR extracts type and sort context analysis from `TypeInference`. All the types that are given explicitly and do not have to be inferred are stored in annotations in that separate pass. This will enable let us extract processing of type class bodies from `TypeInference` into a separate pass in the next step (we could also just put it in the new pass).

The code already passes tests, but needs some serious cleanup before it can be considered stable.
- [ ] Review all the TMP notes. Also take another look at all the AST handlers to make sure nothing got lost in the process.
- [ ] Get rid or most egregious duplication. The new pass started as a copy of `TypeInference` and duplicates its helpers, definitions and even error codes.
- [ ] Clean up annotations.
    - Consider renaming `type` in type context to something else to avoid confusion.
    - Perhaps we should already move the `members`, `operators` and `typeClassFunctions` to the new pass.
- [ ] Check if we need any new tests.
