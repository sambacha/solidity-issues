@aarlt is the dependency cache fix a per-requisite for this, or can we merge it after the release?

Its not strictly needed, but it would be great to have - here we do a lot compilation from source (boost, z3 & evmone).. but without the cache we would need to do that very often, again and again.. I think we really need a working cache for that

Wait, how is this merge-able without approves? At least I don't see any approvals...

@nikola-matic ah.. its just because this one would only merge into the `osx-caching` branch

Ah OK, I thought both branches were targeting develop.

Oh, an important question: did you test the binary outside of CI? Are we sure that people will be able to properly use it as a static binary when we release it tomorrow?

Looks like build takes slightly longer now (but could be a fluke, variability is quite large), but we got almost 2x speed up in tests and more than that in bytecode comparison.

I was not yet able to test the binary outside of the CI. I still have limited access to circleCI, maybe I should take that as an oportunity to setup my circle-ci account.

But I asked @nikola-matic yesterday to investigate the binaries, the defined architectures and used libaries. It looked good.

You can get artifacts without logging in though. For example I can see [`solc` from the last run on the `Artifacts` page](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32627/workflows/70749d51-5b9f-49b8-a54b-0e3ac566b16d/jobs/1461247/artifacts). Is it blank for you?

Thats great :)

I think it makes sense that the build is slower, because we are building now for two architectures.

Awesome! I didn't knew that! Thanks!

I just tested the binary locally and it looks good!

@nikola-matic If you can, please also try the binary in the morning before you start the release - as a final sanity check for this.

Sure thing - mine is x86_64, and we already know the ARM binary is good.
