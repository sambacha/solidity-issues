**Labels**: `experimental`

The assert is not necessary, and breaks all semantic tests, which were previously working.

This should go into `develop`, like the original PR.

Also if `object()` is ok then I'd expect the runtime bytecode, asm and anything IR to work as well.

Switched base to `develop`. Will remove other runtime asserts tomorrow to see what happens.

This should not go into ``develop``... the state on develop does **not** have code generation implemented for experimental solidity - only the newAnalysis branch introduces that and only there the asserts should be removed (as previously discussed)

At least that was the intention, but it's not like it matters too much, so if it speeds things up, we can also just merge this.

Nah, you're right, removing these on develop is completely pointless without changes from newAnalysis.

@cameel @ekpyron these are all of the unimplemented asserts I could remove without triggering failures. Please take a look, and if this is fine, I'll squash the commits and merge. 

The minimum to allow the builds to pass (soltest) is the first commit (`CompilerStack::object`) - this essentially allows us to run semantic tests as before.

Neat, I forgot to squash.
