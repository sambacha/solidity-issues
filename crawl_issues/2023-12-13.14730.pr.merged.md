**Labels**: `experimental`

See [the discussion on `#solidity-dev`](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ethereum_solidity-dev:gitter.im/$kcWffrukBtJ3lICAE0oJak-p1Jc7q2awYovTDrdLD-Y) for context.

I still think that `typeAnnotation()` is better as long as this is a private helper in the context of `TypeInference`, but I don't want to spend any more time arguing about it so I'm renaming it back. And I'm going to submit some PRs to add/improve helpers later which may make the point moot anyway.
