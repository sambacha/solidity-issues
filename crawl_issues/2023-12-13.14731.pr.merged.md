Closes #14729.

After taking a closer look at the bytecode comparison failures in newAnalysis, turns out that it's not #13925 that's breaking the bytecode comparison. There's actually a small bug in the report script that went undiscovered until now.

The script was not taking into account the exit code from the compiler (which is irrelevant for Standard JSON interface but not for CLI). It went unnoticed because it does not make any difference under normal circumstances. If the compiler does not produce any outputs it's interpreted as an error anyway. Even with ICEs like `UnimplementedFeatureError` as long as the ICE happened before the compilation ended, it worked as expected.

The new element in `newAnalysis` is that after #14659 we get an ICE only at the point where we request metadata. At this point the bytecode has already been successfully compiled and printed to the output so it looks to the script like a successful compilation missing metadata. The failure can only be detected by looking at the exit-code or trying to parse out the ICE from the CLI output (which the script intentionally does not do).

I just [tried this with a `newAnalysis` rebased on top of it and the fix finally makes bytecode comparison pass](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32062/workflows/4608cf10-df5f-4df5-85d0-b1235c0d5712).
