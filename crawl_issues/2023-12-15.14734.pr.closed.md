**Labels**: `experimental`

This is something I should have done already in #14558. This puts both built-in and user-defined classes in the same pass.

I need it to be able to move instantiation registration out of `TypeInference`. The new pass has to access the `builtinClasses` annotation, which is in `TypeInference`.
