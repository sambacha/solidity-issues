# [\#14735 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14735) `closed`: Instantiation registration pass in new analysis
**Labels**: `has dependencies`, `experimental`

Depends on #14734.
Prerequisite for #14721.

This is pass 2.25 from [Experimental Type System Notes](https://notes.ethereum.org/_OSmtx9aQAOHQXwa60IDsQ):

> Pass 2.25: visit all type class instantiations (header, not body!), registering class instances with the type system (note: no validation of actually properly implemented functions yet!)

It will allow me to remove out-of order visitation of instantiations from #14721.
