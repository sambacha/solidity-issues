# [\#14736 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14736) `merged`: Remove unreachable errors from instantiation processing in `TypeInference`
**Labels**: `experimental`

Extracted from my initial version of #14735 for easier review.

I noticed that several errors are unreachable because we already have the same (or broader) checks in `TypeRegistration` and `TypeClassRegistration` (I included some tests to show that these checks get triggered instead). We can replace them with asserts and simplify the code.
