This PR introduces basic support for the transient storage opcodes TSTORE and TLOAD for **inline assembly only**.
Based on previous groundwork by @hrkrshnn (Thank you :pray:).

I just had another quick look through this, and we should still really have some semantics tests for this.

The easiest one would be a simple reentrancy lock, so something like:


```
contract C {
  modifier nonreentrant {
    assembly {
      if tload(0) { revert(0, 0) }
      tstore(0, 1)
    }
    _;
   assembly {
      tstore(0, 0)
   }
  }
  function f(bool simulateReentrancy) nonreentrant public {
    if (simulateReentrancy) {
       f(false);
    }
  }
}
// ----
// f(bool): false ->
// f(bool): true -> FAILURE
```

For more complex cases, like testing the behaviour across multiple transactions, we'd actually need to see how evmone handles this right now. So I'm actually not sure what the following test would do currently:

```
contract C {
   function f() external { assembly { tstore(0, 42) } }
   function g() external returns(uint r) { assembly { r := tload(0) } }
}
// ----
// f() ->
// g() -> which is it, 0 or 42? depends on whether evmone and the way we call this consider these calls separate transactions
```

Also a few of other sanity tests (showing collision-freeness with memory and storage and such) may be nice.
I mean, we're more testing evmone here than us, but still we should have these tests to see if anything breaks (it could also be us assigning incorrect opcode values or such, e.g. by accident swapping ``tstore`` and ``tload`` - or not accounting for an opcode reassignment since Hari's draft etc)


```
tstore(0, 21)
mstore(0, 42)
sstore(0, 42)
if iszero(eq(tload(0), 21)) {
  revert(0, 0)
}
```

CI should be fixable largely with EVM version restrictions ``>= cancun`` in the respective tests.

Regarding the second test case in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14737#issuecomment-1861555731:
Once we have evmone bumped, the expectation for the call into ``g()`` will be ``0``: we treat each test call as separate transaction. But that means we should also have a test like:


```
contract C {
  function get(uint256 addr) external returns (uint256 x) {
    assembly { x := tload(addr) }
  }
  function set(uint256 addr, uint256 x) external {
    assembly { tstore(addr, x) }
  }
}

contract Test {
  C c;
  constructor() {
    c = new C();
  }
  function test() {
    assert(c.get(0) == 0 && c.get(42) == 0);
    c.set(0, 21);
    assert(c.get(0) == 21 && c.get(42) == 0);
    c.set(42, 131);
    assert(c.get(0) == 21 && c.get(42) == 131);
  }
}
// ----
// test() ->
// test() ->
```

or something like that.
I.e. test that transient storage survives multiple external calls, but is reset between transactions.

Also needs to take care of this not being breaking: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11763

I rebased the PR on `develop` and added a fixup with some smaller tweaks that weren't worth a comment.

I just merged MCOPY PR so this needs conflict resolutions.
