# [\#14738 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14738) `merged`: Increase resource_class of prb-math external test

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2023-12-18 18:28](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14738):

The external tests for PRB-Math have started failing and are consuming all the memory of the CI Docker image. You can view the details of the issue [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32143/workflows/a5118a82-64ef-4dab-b758-a875e9a60605/jobs/1437064/resources).

The problem may be related to a recent change made in this commit: https://github.com/PaulRBerg/prb-math/commit/5aa88e73a9f9ef2a5aebd9f319e391797759ab55. However, I haven't delved deeply into the specifics of the updated dependencies.
