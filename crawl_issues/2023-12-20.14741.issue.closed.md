Part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14739.
Two steps, first PR:

- Implement the MCOPY opcode as specified in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656

Follow-up PRs:

- Adjust array copy functions in IR code generation to use ``mcopy`` whenever available.
- Adjust legacy code generation to use ``mcopy`` whenever available.
- Any further adjustements of code that copies - this may include https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14117 obsoleting it for Cancun (i.e. change the copy and the pricing heuristics there)

Also needs to take care of this not being breaking: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11763
