Hi @XiaoXiaofanzi could you provide more information of your building environment? For instance, what is the Solidity compiler version you are trying to build? Is it the latest version in the `develop` branch? Because it seems to work fine for me here.
Also, what is your operating system and how you are trying to build the compiler from the source, i.e. the commands you are using.
