Last time I checked, there was no noticable performance change with using a different hash function - have you measured this? If this has a significant effect, we can consider it (I'd actually not just inline a custom implementation, but just properly pull in the upstream implementation then, though), but if measurement comes short, there's no justification for the added complexity here.

I will benchmark it later

I'll close this for the time being, since I assume that my previous benchmarks that indicated that this doesn't de-facto yield any measureable performance gain, will still hold nowadays. But if you actually get around to do measurements here and find that it actually improves performance, we can revisit this and merge (a version of) it!
