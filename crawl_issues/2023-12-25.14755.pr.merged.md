Yeah, saw the missing SMT support when initially implementing this last year (was especially evident when `grep`ing `basefee`); I may have even asked (or was planning to and then didn't wanna ping people during Christmas) whose responsibility that is. But yeah, given that I have nothing more pressing to do, I can give it a go in another PR.

I mean, it's probably something that @pgebal would pick sooner or later. We just need an issue for it.
