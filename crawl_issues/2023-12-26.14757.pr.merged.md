~Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14743~ (merged)
First part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14740

This PR implements the blobhash opcode as specified in the EIP-4844 and add tests for assembler mode. The opcode is not exposed to Solidity in this part; that will be addressed in part 2. While it's intended to be non-breaking, additional tests may be required.
