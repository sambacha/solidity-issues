These tests [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14759/files#diff-3b2fc250ca2b6b73d685a3d2794bceca6cd74a680d507c057839ed13c31b2874) should be restricted to `>=cancun` and have the correspondent syntax tests for `<cancun` without the warning. But first I need to figure out what to do about this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14759#discussion_r1446634973

Can you rebase it on #14757 again? I want to make sure that stuff that should be included there is actually there and not here but that's hard because the commit from #14757 is showing through.

Like the `blobbasefee` PR, this is missing the fuzzer support (to be dealt with by @bshastry) and SMTChecker support (please either add it to #14780 or create a separate issue).
