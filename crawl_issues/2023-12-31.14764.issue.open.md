<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

As per [the grammar](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/grammar.html), [`inheritance-specifier`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/grammar.html#a4.SolidityParser.inheritanceSpecifier)s optionally accept a [`call-argument-list`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/grammar.html#a4.SolidityParser.callArgumentList) which is either a comma-separated list of expressions or a braced `identifier: expression` list. The latter is not accepted by Solc.

The same can be applied to [`modifier-invocation`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/grammar.html#a4.SolidityParser.modifierInvocation)s.

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.23+commit.f704f362.Linux.g++
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Shanghai
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
```
-->

```solidity
contract InheritMe {
	constructor (uint a, bool b) {}
}

contract C is InheritMe({a: 0, b: true}) {}
```

```shell
$ solc a.sol
Error: Expected primary expression.
 --> a.sol:5:25:
  |
5 | contract C is InheritMe({a: 0, b: true}) {}
  |                         ^
```

---

```solidity
contract C {
	modifier mod(uint a, bool b) {
		_;
	}

	function f() public pure mod({a: 0, b: true}) {}
}
```

```shell
$ solc b.sol
Error: Expected primary expression.
 --> b.sol:6:31:
  |
6 |     function f() public pure mod({a: 0, b: true}) {}
  |                                  ^
```
