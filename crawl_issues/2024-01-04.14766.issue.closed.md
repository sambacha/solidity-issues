## Abstract

This no longer seems to be true in Solidity >= 0.8. ABI decoding now reverts when it encounters dirty high-order bits. Can you please confirm this is no longer an issue and add a comment to the documentation (or remove this section), or clarify why this is still an issue in Solidity >= 0.8?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
