Replaces #14760.
**Note**: This should not be merged without #14768.

This is just a minimal part of #14760 that's sufficient to fix the GMP build.

In the end I decided to submit this as a new PR rather than take over #14760. The original PR has some other unrelated changes (like evmone or cmake) and generally looks like it's just a messy branch meant to test things out rather to be merged (it's even called a "sandbox"). It also has some minor refactors and I'd actually like to add more (like switching to a build from Ubuntu sources or installing cmake from a package), but might require some discussion and we need the GMP fix soon, so I'm going to do all that in a separate PR.
