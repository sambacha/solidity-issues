Depends on #14767 (should be merged together).

~**Note**: I moved the ossfuzz job to the main workflow to test the image. This will be removed before the PR is merged.~ Done.

Looks like CI kinda passed. I.e. [`t_ubu_ossfuzz` did fail like it does in `nightly`](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32268/workflows/c8966e62-37b8-4e83-8709-b0a3a8d5e526/jobs/1442994), but not because of anything GMP-related so I'm going to assume it's fine.

And brink failure is unrelated - standard ext test breakage. We can fix it separately.

So I'm removing the debug commit and making this reviewable.
