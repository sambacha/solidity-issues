In this release cycle we had to introduce a bunch parser hacks to avoid breaking existing code:
- In order to introduce new Yul opcodes in a non-breaking way, we had to mark them as exceptions for older EVM versions [in `createReservedIdentifiers()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.27/libyul/backends/evm/EVMDialect.cpp#L159-L167):
    - `basefee`
    - `prevrandao`
    - `tstore`
    - `tload`
    - `blobbasefee`
    - `blobhash`
    - `mcopy`
- New keywords needed for storage layout syntax (#597):
    - `at`
    - `layout`
- New keywords needed for transient storage (#15007)
    - `transient`
- `code` or `contractdata`
    - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13368
    - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13723

In the next breaking release the exceptions should be removed and keywords added.
