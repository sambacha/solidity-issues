Related to #14739 (in particular https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14737#discussion_r1444508484 and my upcoming `MCOPY` PR).

I needed to understand how those gas tiers work to add a new one for `MCOPY`. In the end it turned out that I don't even need to do it (tiers only represent the static cost and for the dynamic part I just need to add `MCOPY` next to other `...COPY` opcodes in `GasMeter::estimateMax()`). Still, this was not obvious at first and I had to spend some effort to dig up that info, so I decided to add some comments explaining how to use it and how those tiers relate to constants from Execution Specs and opcode groups from Yellow Paper.

The PR also removes some obsolete tiers and an unnecessary exception handler (see review comments).

Yeah, this is just a refactor+docs. No non-trivial behavior changes. Like, the removed `try`/`catch` may result in a better message showing up on the console and that's all.
