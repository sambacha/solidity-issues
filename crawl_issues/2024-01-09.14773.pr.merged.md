Brink is a CommonJS project and currently depends on [Chai version 4.x](https://github.com/brinktrade/brink-core/blob/master/package.json#L21). However, the recent transition of Chai to ESM-only starting from version 5.x (see: https://github.com/chaijs/chai/issues/1561#issuecomment-1871134261) has led to CI failures in our external tests (see: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32302/workflows/998b76e7-be1f-4e17-843e-9d8e212a4df6/jobs/1444699).

Given that our external tests always run with the latest dependencies, it seems fine to temporarily fix the Chai version to 4.x until Brink migrates to ESM.
