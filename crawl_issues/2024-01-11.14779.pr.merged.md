# [\#14779 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14779) `merged`: Yul builtin for `MCOPY`

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-01-11 14:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14779):

First part of #14741.
~~Depends on #14790.~~

Still to do:
- [x] Fix `RedundantAssignEliminator` wrongly removing `MCOPY` in some cases.
- [x] Account for gas due to memory expansion of both read and write.
- [x] More semantic tests, especially for the optimizer.
    - [x] `RedundantAssignEliminator`
    - [x] `EqualStoreEliminator`
    - [x] `yulInterpreterTest` for `MCOPY` memory expansion.
    - [x] Full suite
    - [x] Memory guard

Just FYI: I also just looked through potential effects on the ``LoadResolver`` and such - ultimately memory is tracked by the ``DataFlowAnalyzer`` there, though, which on each ``ExpressionStatement`` (that's not a simple ``mstore`` or ``sstore``) that has ``sideEffects.invalidatesMemory()`` (which should include ``mcopy``), properly clear knowledge about memory, so that part looks fine!

I also just looked through the code, to see if an ``mcopy`` will prevent an unmarked assembly block from being implicitly considered "memory-safe", resulting in a ``memoryguard`` being emitted - but that relies on ``_inlineAssembly.annotation().hasMemoryEffects``, which should be correctly set based on the defined memory side-effects. It wouldn't hurt to add a ``memoryGuardTest``, though (just with a simple ``assembly { mcopy(0, 1, 2) }`` or whatever making sure that won't result in a ``memoryguard`` being emitted)

Good point about memory guard tests. I haven't actually considered that.

For now I added extensive tests for mcopy in unused store eliminator and equal store eliminator in isolation, but I guess I should also add at least some full suite tests to catch anything that might be done by other steps I did not consider.

We'll probably end up having more behaviour implicitly covered by tests than we had testing these components in total before ;-). Meaning: more tests won't hurt, but we also need to be mindful that a lot of this cannot be exhaustively tested, so we have to additionally rely on fuzzing and code path review as well.

As for code path review: I haven't found anything in the Yul optimizer yet.
We shouldn't forget the libevmasm optimizer, though - I'll have a quick look there as well. EDIT: I think libevmasm/KnownState.cpp:L182 catching ``MCOPY`` as memory writing operation should be enough there.

These tests are still not even close to being exhaustive. I did try to err on the side of including too many tests rather than missing an important one, but I still ended up dropping like 2/3 of those I originally wanted to add. For example I dropped most of the tests checking the removal of `MCOPY` because in the end that should not happen.

It's hard to get a good balance though. I may have gone a bit overboard, but I really didn't want to risk adding too few and causing another important bug in unused store remover. The fact that I originally broke it in the PR made me really wary of this. Also I missed that overlap problem in the interpreter - in that case I assumed that a single test would be enough and I was wrong :)

All the changes are done now. This can be now reviewed. Not marking as reviewable yet only because it depends on #14790. Also, I need to deal with the failing test (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14779#discussion_r1460165168), but that will not really affect the PR in a significant way.
