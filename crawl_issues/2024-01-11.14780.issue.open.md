Given the recent introduction of `blobbasefee` in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14755 for the Cancun fork, `blobbasefee` support should be implemented for the SMT checker as well. See implementation of `basefee` (London) for reference: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11785

@pgebal may be of interest to you. If I have some spare time, I may also look into this.
