This PR changes our test suite to account for the EIP-6780 [SELFDESTRUCT only in same transaction](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780).

The semantics of `selfdestruct` have changed in EVM version Cancun, now it will *only* transfer all Ether in the account to the beneficiary. However, the current behavior is preserved when `selfdestruct` is called in the same transaction as the contract was created.

- [x] Update tests
- [x] Update documentation (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13889)
- [ ] Add an entry about the functionality change in the release blog post
