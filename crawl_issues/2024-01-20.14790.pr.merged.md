Prerequisite for #14779.

A bunch of enhancements to the test framework that I did while working on `MSIZE`. Some of my tests depend on them:
- Restricting minimum EVM version in boost tests and memory guard tests.
- Memory guard tests were ignoring EVM version selected on the command line.
- Memory guard tests were hiding the errors from Yul parsing, which includes ones you get when you try to use an opcode that's not available on the selected EVM version.
- All tests in `GasMeter.cpp` were apparently disabled on abicoder v2 in #5102. Most of them work fine though, so I changed it back so that both v1 and v2 run by default and only those few tests that are broken have a bypass.
- Small formatting tweak in a few `AnalysisFramework` based test to make them print errors properly prefixed with the right indent.
- Small `EVMInstructionInterpreter.h` refactors that I originally had in #14779.
