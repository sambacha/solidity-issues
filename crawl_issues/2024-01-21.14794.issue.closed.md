**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `low effort`, `low impact`

## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.23/types.html#members-of-addresses

## Abstract
`addr.codehash` output depends on the `addr` balance. It'll output 0 if the balance is 0 (and `addr` doesn't have any code, of course). Otherwise, if the balance is > 0, it'll output `keccak256("")`.

The issue might be considered a bug because the existing documentation treats `.codehash` as an equivalent of `keccak256(addr.code)`, which, as you can see below in the PoC, has a different output.

PoC:
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.23;

contract Test1 {
    address subject = address(123);

    function getCodehash()
        external
        payable
        returns (
            bytes32 codeHashBefore,
            bytes32 codeHashAfter,
            bytes32 hashBefore,
            bytes32 hashAfter
        )
    {
        hashBefore = subject.codehash;
        codeHashBefore = keccak256(subject.code);

        payable(subject).transfer(1);

        hashAfter = subject.codehash;
        codeHashAfter = keccak256(subject.code);
    }
}
```

The function's output:
```json
{
	"0": "bytes32: codeHashBefore 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470",
	"1": "bytes32: codeHashAfter 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470",
	"2": "bytes32: hashBefore 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
	"3": "bytes32: hashAfter 0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470"
}
```

Agree, should be addressed. The recent contest showed that there is a slight misunderstanding: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-10-wildcat#h-02-codehash-check-in-factory-contracts-does-not-account-for-non-empty-addresses

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
