I'd love to hop on this! It'll be my first PR here, and had a question re: test running. If I make a new file in `syntaxTests/viewPureChecker` would it be read by the test runner automatically or do I have to add it in some file for it to be indexed?

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
