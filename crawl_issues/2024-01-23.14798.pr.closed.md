Needs rebase.

Also, why the change? I mean, I also don't like that we're not consistent about naming around the code base (`macos` vs `osx` vs probably a few other variants), but I'm not sure we can really get it consistent everywhere. I haven't really looked at it detail, but I suspect changing some of those names might come with backwards-compatibility problems.

I was thinking to just rename that, because Apple renamed OS X to macOS already in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sierra) to be more aligned with the other operating system names: iOS, watchOS and tvOS.
