Seems simple and cool to me without losing anything afaik. I think this is what has already changed for `constructor()`?

Hi @z0r0z, thanks for the question. However, the `payable` modifier can also be applied to functions with `external` visibility. So, I don't see a clear advantage in not explicitly stating it in the function declaration.

Not really, since Solidity version `0.7.0`, the function visibility is no longer required for constructors (neither `public` nor `internal`). However, note that constructors are not `payable` by default; you need to explicitly declare them as payable.

thanks for your clarifications and thoughts @r0qs. I think the idea I propose more is that by default anything that is payable be made public as a syntactic sugar. It sort of works with the idea that you can make a constructor payable, and it is public by default. But I appreciate the tension against the fact that external is also optionally payable.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
