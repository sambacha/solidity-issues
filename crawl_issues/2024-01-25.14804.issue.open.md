The SMTChecker currently uses the [default EVM version](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/62e27e4b712234c78c71e03f359cb287ae75db1b/test/libsolidity/SMTCheckerTest.cpp#L29), which is Shanghai. However, with the recent addition of Cancun support, the semantic of `selfdestruct` has changed. Consequently, we may need to adjust the tests to reflect the new behavior.

For more information, please refer to [EIP-6780](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6780) and PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14785.
