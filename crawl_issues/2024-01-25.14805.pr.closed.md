Sorry, but this change does not address the issue at all.

The idea is to take all tests from `test/libsolidity/ViewPureChecker.cpp`, create equivalent syntax tests and remove the .cpp file.

Hi @cameel , this is still in the works. I've posted a question on the original issue, posting it here for convenience: Would the test runner pick up these tests automatically or do I need to index the new tests somewhere? 

Thanks!

Thanks for the attempt, but currently it doesn't look like there is progress here, so I'm closing the PR.
