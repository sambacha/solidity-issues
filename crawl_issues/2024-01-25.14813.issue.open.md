# [\#14813 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14813) `open`: New macOS Universal Binaries are signed
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Our new Unversal Binary Executable is now signed, while our old executables where not signed at all. This might create different behaviour related to security prompts. 

We might need to discuss whether we should just remove the signature (if possible), or whether we need to sign it in a proper way.

Old Executable:
```
# codesign -dv --verbose=4 solc-macos
solc-macos: code object is not signed at all
```

New Universal Binary Executable:
```
# codesign -dv --verbose=4 solc-macos
Executable=solc-macos

What would signing it properly entail? I guess that'd mean registering an official account with Apple and managing credentials for it? Knowing Apple probably even paying for getting it verified (I'm not sure)?

If you want your apps to open on a Mac that has Gatekeeper enabled or want to distribute apps in the App Store, you need to [create a developer ID](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/DistributingApplicationsOutside/DistributingApplicationsOutside.html) to sign your Mac apps and installer packages; only Apple Developer code signing certificates are compatible with GateKeeper.

You can use a codesigning certificate that is self issued by yourself, however you will need the end user to install the certificate on their machine, and you still do not have the benefit of being accessible without bypassing GateKeeper.

## Check for GateKeeper

```bash
    gatekeeper_status=`spctl --status | awk '/assessments/ {print $2}'`
   if [ $gatekeeper_status = "disabled" ]; then
      result=Disabled
   else
      result=Active
   fi
   echo $result
fi
```

### Instrumenting without CodeSign


To instrument a binary that is not codesigned you have to do the following:

> I mention this as its a slight benefit to getting it 'codesigned'. 

```bash
codesign -s - -v -f --entitlements debug.plist $PATH_TO_BINARY_WITH_DSYM_INFO
````
> debug.plist

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "https://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"><plist version="1.0"><dict><key>com.apple.security.get-task-allow</key><true/></dict></plist>
````


## 0.8.24

My local binary shows a non-universal binary, only arm-64 under `Format`

```console
$ codesign -dv --verbose=4  $HOME/.svm/0.8.24/solc-0.8.24
Executable=/Users/janitor/.svm/0.8.24/solc-0.8.24

I would prefer not to use universal binary tbh, the binary is more performant built native.

My differing solc binary is due to `svm-rs` and it providing aarch64 binaries separately, alloy-rs/solc-builds#13

We decided to move back to the previous status quo that was fully unsigned binaries for the time being in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14869, so I'm closing this until there is a user-request for having signatures.

Are you sure? Universal binaries *are* native builds, just several of them for multiple platforms packed together. The only difference you should see is the size of the binary, not in performance.

The perf diff was due to using a different linker (its called sold) - forgot it was set as default on this computer

Reopening since we ended up reverting #14869 and the release binaries are still signed with an ad-hoc signature. We need to decide whether we're fine with that or if we actually want to try to get it signed properly (maybe there's still some way that does not require kowtowing to Apple?).
