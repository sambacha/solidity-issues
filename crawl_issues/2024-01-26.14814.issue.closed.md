# [\#14814 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14814) `closed`: Incoherence in compiler output and CHC encoding produced by SolCMC
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31989062?v=4" width="50">[BritikovKI](https://github.com/BritikovKI) opened issue at [2024-01-26 08:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14814):

## Description

SolCMC can be used to specifically only produce the CHC encoding of the `.sol` file. Though, for the following `.sol` code snippet:
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint wad) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, wad);
    }
```
SolCMC doesn't add a limitation for the line `payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);`, specifically it would be expected that CHC encoding would contain `wad > 0` somewhere in the encoding, as `wad = 0` lead to the transaction revert.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.24
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Forge (but doesn't matter)
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Doesn't apply
- Operating system: Manjaro Linux/ Mac OS

## Steps to Reproduce

Run SolCMC encoder on the following Solidity code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

contract WETH9 {

    mapping (address => uint)                       public  balanceOf;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint))  public  allowance;

    function withdraw(uint wad) public {
            require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= wad);
            balanceOf[msg.sender] -= wad;
            payable(msg.sender).transfer(wad);
            assert(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= 0);
        }
}
```

Expected behaviour is to have some limitation on `wad` as a part of CHC encoding.
