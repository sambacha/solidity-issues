I'm closing this since the top level issue itself was closed https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14817, and we have no current plans to fully remove the warning. In the coming releases, we'll either tone it down to INFO level, or will introduce a way to disable it explicitly (e.g. something akin to the `memory-safe` annotation for inline assembly blocks).
