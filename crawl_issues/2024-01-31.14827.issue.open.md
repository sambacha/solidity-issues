In compiler's output bytecode, some values need special attention during source code verification. These fields can be different between the compiled bytecode vs the on-chain bytecode. Still, they shouldn't break the verification because they are typically filled/assigned after compilation or the changes are not because of a change in the executed code (but comments etc.)

1. Libraries: External library addresses are [linked](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#library-linking) with `--link` or in JSON-input `libraries:`. This would replace the placeholder in format `__$53aea86b7d70b31448b230b20ae141a537$__` with the library address in the bytecode.
2. Immutables: [Immutable variables](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#immutable) in the bytecode are set to `000000...` in the bytecode in compilation and only assigned a value in the constructor during deployment. 
3. CBOR metadata: [Appended](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/metadata.html#encoding-of-the-metadata-hash-in-the-bytecode) to the runtime bytecode. Contains the metadata hash so any slight change to the source files or the metadata file contents will change this value. If during verification the onchain CBOR does not match the compiled one, this will yield a [partial match](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/full-vs-partial-match/).

It is trivial to find libraries and immutables in a compiled bytecode because the former has special `__$` placeholders and the latter's indexes are output in `immutableReferences` in the compiler.

However, the CBOR metadata part is not trivial to find:
1. The bytecode can contain other contract bytecodes **nested** (e.g. factories) so only the main contract's CBOR is at the end of the bytecode and the other contracts' positions are unknown.
2. Even if there's a single contract, the CBOR metadata is not necessarily at the end of the bytecode for the **creation bytecode**. It can be anywhere.

That's why verifiers typically use workarounds to find the exact positions such as adding whitespaces to all sources to change the metadata hashes. That requires recompiling the contract and is an expensive operation.

I suggest the compiler outputs the bytecode positions of the CBOR encoded metadata parts of the contracts, similar to how it's done in `immutableReferences`. This would make the source-code verification processes easier and also extracting the CBOR parts for other purposes.

Edit: Wrote an article about this, for some context: https://docs.sourcify.dev/blog/finding-auxdatas-in-bytecode/
