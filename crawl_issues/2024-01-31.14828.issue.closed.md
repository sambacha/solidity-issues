## Abstract

When calling a function with reference types (such as `uint256[]`), the function is allowed to mutate the contents of the parameter.
There is currently no way to tell just by looking at the function definition whether the function mutates the contents of the reference or not; the only way is being explicit with the documentation or reading the actual code.

In other words, the compiler does not give the developer any hints on whether the memory parameter sent to a function will stay the same or not after the call. This ambiguity can be error prone in certain cases.

## Motivation

Functions can be labeled as `view` or `pure` if they don't write / read storage. These labels provide very valuable information to the reader of the code at first sight.

It would be great to have an equivalent for memory parameters. In this case, the label would apply to the parameters, not the function.

For example, let's suppose a function that searches for an element in an array, and returns its index. This function shouldn't modify the given array, and could be defined as follows:
```
function getIndexOfToken(address[] readonly memory tokens, address token) internal pure returns (uint256 index);
```

If the function does alter the given parameters, it would be defined as it is today. For example, a function that sorts a given array of values, mutating its contents:
```
function sort(uint256[] memory values) internal pure;
```

`readonly` and `const` are two keywords that come to mind, but there could be other options as well (e.g. reusing `view`).

## Specification

- Introduce a new keyword that shall be used to (optionally) label memory parameters.
- If a memory argument is `readonly` and the function attempts to modify its contents, throw an error when compiling.
- If a memory argument is _not_ specified as readonly and the function does not modify its contents, throw a warning when compiling.

## Backwards Compatibility

Given that the `readonly` label would be optional, it wouldn't break backwards compatibility. For functions that don't use it and don't actually mutate the contents of the memory arguments, a warning would be issued but the code should still compile.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
