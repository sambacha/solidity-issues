# [\#14833 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14833) `merged`: Fix openzeppelin external test

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457348?u=e02c93e6d98c1154952140a8d5af50d9d5ca59c9&v=4" width="50">[r0qs](https://github.com/r0qs) opened issue at [2024-02-05 13:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14833):

Fix openzeppelin external test that started to fail. See: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32755/workflows/23dee02b-197d-4522-a3ae-1c31e43afffa/jobs/1468409

Not really sure about the cause, it appears related to version incompatibility between `ethers` version `6.10.0` and `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers` version `2.0.4`, which are used by our external test script, since we remove the `package-lock.json` file.
