## Description

When copying a `memory` or `calldata` array to storage, solc will report the compile-time error: `Error: Unimplemented feature (/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/ArrayUtils.cpp:227):Copying of type struct Counter.Discount calldata[] calldata to storage not yet supported.`
However, this works if said array is a member of a struct and has a data location of `calldata`.

## Environment

- Compiler version: v0.8.24
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): paris
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04

## Steps to Reproduce

For the following PoC, `setTiers` will work correctly and copy the contents of `_tiers` to `tiers`. Yet `setDiscounts` will produce the ICE provided above with `forge build`. `setTiers` will give the above ICE itself if `_tiers` has data location `memory`.

Why does solc permit copying arrays to storage if the data location is `calldata` and it is part of a struct?

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Counter {
    struct DiscountTiers {
        Discount[] discounts;
    }

    struct Discount {
        uint256 discount;
        uint256 expiry;
    }

    DiscountTiers tiers;
    Discount[] discounts;

    function setTiers(DiscountTiers calldata _tiers) public {
        tiers = _tiers;
    }

    function getTiers() public view returns (Discount[] memory) {
        return tiers.discounts;
    }

    function setDiscounts(Discount[] calldata _discounts) public {
        discounts = _discounts;
    }
}
```

Note that this works in `--via-ir`.

Minimized (from @lum7na in https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/7085):

        bool anything;
    }

    S[] s;

    function f() external {
        s = new S[](0);
    }
}
```

Full error:

Good to know! This is much easier and `via-ir` no longer takes 45 minutes to build files. However, is there any reason why this feature couldn't be available without IR?
