Something's still wrong. [Windows jobs are failing in my PRs](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/32850/workflows/3d031807-b80c-4146-a7f7-8942f6771007/jobs/1473729) that I just rebased on `develop`:

```
ln: failed to create symbolic link '/c/Python312/python3': No such file or directory 
```
