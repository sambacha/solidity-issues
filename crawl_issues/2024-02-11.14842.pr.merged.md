# [\#14842 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14842) `merged`: More robust error handling and improved formatting in `gas_diff_stats.py`
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Prerequisite for #14477.

Originally I wanted to add a simple smoke test for `gas_diff_stats.py` but the script just continues as if nothing happened on most errors. Which also makes it annoying to check whether my changes in expectation formatting in the other PR actually affected it. So this PR makes it fail more.
- Fail on gas expectations other `ir`, `irOptimized`, `legacy`, `legacyOptimized`.
- Fail on git errors.
- Fail when the test dir does not exist.

While at it, I also tweaked the table to be more readable:
- Percentages are rounded to integers now.
    - But shows `-0%` or `+0%` when rounding to zero to show if there was a difference or not.
- Files are sorted alphabetically now (order was not deterministic before).
- Leave cell blank instead of claiming zero when the old value is not present in the diff.

Yeah, I was waiting with rebasing until we get the CI issues resolved and then I forgot to get back because I was busy with optimizer sequence research. I'll try it now.

Actually, for CI to pass here we still need #14875 and #14880.

Yeah, but that's (hopefully) just non-required CI and we can merge over it (since @matheusaaguiar could make use the PR depending on this)

Each one is a separate atomic change. I could probably squash one or two if I had to, but really, this should be rather based on whether the changes are separate not on some arbitrary limit.

Defining what's a separate atomic change is in itself arbitrary. The issue is not imposing an arbitrary limit, the question is what's a sane granularity in trying to track individual changes - and this by far overdoing it. But I don't care too much about the aesthetics of commit history, so no point arguing about it (hence it's merged as is)
