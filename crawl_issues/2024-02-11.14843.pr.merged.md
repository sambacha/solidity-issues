I'm fine with the format as is in the PR - so I'd say let's just try to get this merged quickly as well, s.t. we can start using the data - and we can still at a later point change it further, if we ever see the need!

Great. It can go in as soon as #14842 is merged. I just need to rebase and regenerate gas costs on top of `develop`.

So, do you want to rebase it now :-)? I'd myself also squash it, but as you like.

Rebased. I'd rather leave commits separated though.

WTF. #14875 is merged and I just rebased on `develop`. Why is `t_ems_ext_hardhat` still failing?

I mean, it's not required do we can still merge, but still, it should be passing now...

Ah, I guess this is a separate issue that we don't have a fix for yet? I remember switching to the rust/node image being mentioned on the channel so it's probably that.
