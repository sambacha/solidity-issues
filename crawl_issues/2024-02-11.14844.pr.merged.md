Currently isoltest/soltest refuses to update costs with non-standard settings, like non-default EVM version or with ABI coder v1. It would be convenient to bypass this, e.g. in #14834 where we're really interested in seeing how costs change on Cancun.

This PR replaces this validation with a warning.

Even though it would be nice to print the warning in red at the end of the test run, I don't think it's really worth the effort.
