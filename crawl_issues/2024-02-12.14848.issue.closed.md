Hi Solidity maintainers. I'm Lucas, a core contributor to the Drips project (https://www.drips.network/). I help recipients of donations through their learning and onboarding process.

[Zoltu/Deterministic-deployment-proxy](https://github.com/Zoltu/deterministic-deployment-proxy)(https://github.com/Zoltu/deterministic-deployment-proxy) has been using https://github.com/ethereum/solidity. It's in fact one of their most critical dependencies!

Zoltu core contributors appreciate the work you all do and want to make sure that you are all well-funded to keep doing it. For that reason, they have decided to donate some funds to your project through [Drips](https://www.drips.network/)

Who can I talk to about it?

Hi @Lfada, Thanks for reaching out! Do you have any documentation or guides for teams on how to treat drips tax-wise and how to do accounting for this type of financial support? We would need to figure this out first, before we can receive such a type of donation.

Hi @franzihei, we cannot give any docs or guides, I would suggest talking to a lawyer, or accountant to figure things out.

 What I can do is give you a bit more context around the whole thing. This is part of a Dependency Funding initiative to donate/support FOSS repositories. 

What Drips allows you to do, is claim the donations and then split them into your critical dependencies and/or amongst other maintainers. A great example is Ethers.js, which is splitting 40% of all incoming funds to their dependencies as you can see [here](https://www.drips.network/app/projects/github/ethers-io/ethers.js).

[Here's](https://www.drips.network/app/projects/github/ethereum/solidity?exact) Solidity profile in Drips. A maintainer/admin of this GH repo would need to claim the profile to retrieve the funds.

For a step-by-step guide on the claim process, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOl_XkgWv-A) and for more detailed information, [here](https://docs.drips.network/claim-your-repository/) you can find the docs.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
