This PR has the goal of simply changing the copyright year from 2023 to 2024.

Plus, I would suggest to update the following from the [soliditylang.org](https://soliditylang.org/) website:

 - [ ] 2023 date in the website footer:

 - [ ] Twitter logo to X logo.

I don't think we really need the year range there. It does not matter for copyright purposes,  it's mostly informational and for that information the timestamps in the repo are really the canonical source. I'd definitely drop the upper date so that we don't have to bump it constantly, but maybe we should [follow curl's example](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/01/08/copyright-without-years/) and drop the dates completely.

I also don't think we need to hurry too much with following Twitter's weird branding decisions. Their current branding is confusing to the point that just showing the name or logo is ambiguous without some kind of clarification. I'd just not worry about it, keep the old branding and just wait and see what they settle on in the long term.

I can agree that maybe the best solution is to completely remove the year range from code docs and the website footer, however if its kept, I think it should be aligned with the current year.

The same goes for the Twitter/X logo, it's just a matter of branding and attention to details. IMO seeing 2023 and an old brand trademark feels like the project isn't being continued.

Just for more context, see a few examples where this info is up to date:

[Stripe.com](https://stripe.com/en-pl
) (date)
[Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/) (date)
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (date + logo)

However, [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) isn't (- logo) ðŸ˜¶

Yeah, maybe we should really just drop the dates completely.
