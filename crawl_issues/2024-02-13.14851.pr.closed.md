So only `chains.sol` is affected, just like in #14112? Odd. We need more benchmark contracts.

It would be interesting to see it benchmarked the way I did in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14854#issuecomment-2070222067

This would show pure compilation time on some actual projects (I chose Uniswap v4 and Seaport since their latest versions compile without any workarounds) but with less variance than we see in CI. Or at least in a way that makes it easier to run multiple times and average the results.

On the topic of the PR itself - I tried to review it but the diff is almost useless due to all the moved code. It also has no description or changelog and commit descriptions are not very informative, so I'm not really sure what to expect here. The title sounds as if you were just making the code nicer but it does not seem to be all that you're doing here. If you could separate the refactors from actual functional changes, it would be much easier to review.
