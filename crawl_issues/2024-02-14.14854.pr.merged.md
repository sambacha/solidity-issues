# [\#14854 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14854) `merged`: Remove superfluous initial iteration of repeating parts of optimizer sequence
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-02-14 18:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14854):

The optimizer will repeat each bracketed segment of the optimizer step sequence  at least twice, because the cost is only measured after the first iteration. This results in unnecessary repetitions in some cases.

Hard to tell how much it actually affects the optimization time in practice. From my observations, a single iteration is often insufficient so many contracts would not be affected. On the other hand, for the lucky ones where one iteration is enough, it could cut optimization time almost in half. I need to see CI timings to say more.

Looks like I unwittingly introduced this regression back in #12102. Originally this loop looked like this and I moved the check to the end without updating the initialization: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/f35694f655e81d503b3cbc1aee324ea4cc848a3c/libyul/optimiser/Suite.cpp#L84-L92

Looks like the actual differences are minimal, if any, and go in both directions. For most jobs they are within the margin of error.

### Quick and dirty non-CI benchmark

Since CI timing is almost useless here due to a huge variance, I tried to benchmark it manually using a few projects that can be compiled right away via foundry.

<details><summary>script</summary>

```bash
function benchmark_foundry_project {
    local subdir="$1"
    local url="$2"
    local solc_path="$3"

    git clone "$url" "$subdir" --depth=1
    pushd "$subdir"
    forge install
    /usr/bin/time --output ../timing.json --append --format "{\"$subdir\": {\"real\": %e, \"user\": %U, \"sys\": %S}}" \
        forge build --use "$solc_path" --optimize --via-ir --evm-version cancun --offline --no-cache
    popd
    rm -rf "./${subdir}"
}

rm timing.json

solc_binary=/tmp/solc-develop
benchmark_foundry_project uniswap-before https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core "$solc_binary"
benchmark_foundry_project seaport-before https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport-core "$solc_binary"

solc_binary=/tmp/solc-fix-superfluous-iterations-in-optimizer-sequence
benchmark_foundry_project uniswap-after https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core "$solc_binary"
benchmark_foundry_project seaport-after https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport-core "$solc_binary"

cat timing.json | jq --slurp add
```

</details>

I wanted to include OpenZeppelin as well but it sadly fails with "Stack Too Deep" for both binaries (despite the memory guard being present). Same with a 0.8.25 release binary.

#### Results

Looks like this has a lot of variance too, but there's still a clear and reproducible difference in favor of the PR on the order of 10%.

Yeah. It's not a large sample, but it was reproducible when I ran it several times (see the table) so I think it's legit.

BTW, I had to resolve a changelog conflict - please reapprove.
