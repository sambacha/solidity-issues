## Abstract

With reference to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11407 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13384. Mapping parameter names were introduced in solidity. It includes parameter names in the ABI.

This is how the storage layout type for the lapping looks like. `keyName` and `valueName` can be added to this to include the information which can be useful for some tools.

```json
    "t_mapping(t_address,t_bytes31)": {
        "encoding": "mapping",
        "key": "t_address",
        "label": "mapping(address => bytes31)",
        "numberOfBytes": "32",
        "value": "t_bytes31"
      },
```

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

## Motivation

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

Since the key and value name is not available, it is a small problem to not being able to display appropriate name when doing something that uses storage layout.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

`keyName` and `valueName` can be added to the mapping storage type.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->

No backwards compatibility issue.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
