Currently, if 1 has to call a Solidity function that takes a variable sized array as parameter, [he/she is asked to do it off‑chain or rewrite his code so that the function he/she intend to call use fixed size arrays instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/101613/abi-encode-and-abi-decode-arguments-including-variable-sized-arrays#comment124908_101613).  
But 1 popular exchange which called 0x is using `external` functions taking variable‑sized arguments : they can’t be called on chain if the parameters building has to be done on‑chain.

## Specification
Preferably allow `abi.encode` or `abi.encodewithselector` like functions to support telling an argument isn’t taking a fixed‑size array/tuple.

## Backwards Compatibility
This would be a language extension using an additional possible syntax and wouldn’t affect old code encoding fixed‑size arrays.

Hi @ytrezq. 
Thanks for the report, but in the link you posted, the most upvoted answer shows an example of a function with variable sized arrays being called using `abi.encode`.
The Solidity [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/abi-spec.html#types) also explains about non-fixed-size types and tuples:
```
The following non-fixed-size types exist:

    bytes: dynamic sized byte sequence.

    string: dynamic sized unicode string assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.

    <type>[]: a variable-length array of elements of the given type.

Types can be combined to a tuple by enclosing them inside parentheses, separated by commas:

    (T1,T2,...,Tn): tuple consisting of the types T1, …, Tn, n >= 0

It is possible to form tuples of tuples, arrays of tuples and so on. It is also possible to form zero-tuples (where n == 0).
```
