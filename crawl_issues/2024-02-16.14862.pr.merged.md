Under macOS `/usr/local/lib` is not in the default search path, where the `/usr/lib` is protected - they call it `System Integrity Protection`. However, I would prefer to not touch `/usr/lib` and to use `/usr/local/lib` directly, without the need of setting special environment variables (e.g. `ETH_EVMONE`)

I added this inside an `__APPLE__` ifdef, because `/usr/local/lib` is already in the system default library search paths on Linux.

> LGTM. But shouldn't we also remove the `ETH_EVMONE` from the CI, since it will not be needed anymore?

Ok, I just created a #14868 for that.
