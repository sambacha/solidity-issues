# [\#14863 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14863) `closed`: Tag position used instead of tag size to compute size of addresses
**Labels**: `optimizer`, `nice to have`

## Description

In [Assembly.cpp:L865-866](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/5fe31737472cc593cc9957d24a964ebf5491cbeb/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L865-L866), a tag position is compared with a tag size when the assembled object has subs. I.e., `tagPos` (a position) and `subTagSize` (a size) are compared and the maximum between those two values is kept. As a result, `bytesPerTag` and `bytesPerDataRef` sizes are miscomputed when the assembled object has some subs.

The effect is that sometimes, addresses that could fit in `PUSH1 XX` are pushed with `PUSH2 00YY`.

The bug is present with both via-ir and non via-ir modes.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Shanghai
- Operating system: MacOS Sonoma

## Steps to Reproduce

Command: `./solc/solc --optimize --optimize-runs 200 --opcodes --bin ../contracts/Example.sol`

```solidity
pragma solidity <=0.8.25;

contract Example { 
    function b(uint256 x) external view returns(uint256) {
        uint256 y = block.timestamp;
        unchecked{ return y + x + gasleft(); }
    }
}
```

The init code generated for this contract is `6080604052348015600e575f80fd5b5060ca8061001b5f395ff3fe`, where `61001b` could be optimized into `601a`
