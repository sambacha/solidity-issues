# [\#14864 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14864) `merged`: Convert tagPos to a size for address size computation

The bug was fixed by converting the `tagPos` into its size.

Breakdown of changes:
-  `tagPos` is replaced by `numberEncodingSize(tagPos)` to determine the value of `subTagSize` in `Assembly::assemble()`

This fixes #14863

Hi @simon-perriard. I'll be closing this PR since the issue you opened has not been triaged yet, and we have thus not yet decided whether this is a bug (most likely not), or just a missed optimization opportunity. Please keep track of the issue, and once we reach a decision, you can pick it up and open a new PR if you'd like.

The issue does indeed look genuine to me. We should add a Changelog entry to this - but then we can merge it!

It'd be in the ``Bugfix`` category, and the entry could be something like `` * Assembler: Prevent incorrect calculation of tag sizes.``.

Thank you very much for discovering this and for the fix!

I had a closer look also at the CI failures - most of them were just test expectation updates due to changing gas cost - but in fact the logic calculating the tag sizes didn't properly account for potentially referring to tags in subassemblies and that caused some cases to fail after this fix - so I took the liberty to push another fix for this together with test changes and a changelog entry on top of your initial fix.
