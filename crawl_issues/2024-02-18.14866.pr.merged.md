@aarlt can you fetch fresh develop and rebase - the fix for `win_pyscripts` went in last week I believe.

@aarlt feel free to merge if there's no dependencies.

Too late for merging - now it needs a rebase or sth :-). It does pay of to just merge "clearly harmless" stuff like this right with approving, resp. setting it to auto-merge (don't overdo that, but just test-renaming is safe-enough...)

If you're renaming these tests it would probably make sense to also rename the `standard_import_evmasm_...` ones to `standard_import_asm_json_...` since they're testing the same feature, just via Standard JSON.
