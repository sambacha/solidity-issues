## Description

The `parameterSlots`, and `returnSlots` values for the `functionDebugData` of some compiler generated methods implementing getters are wrong.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.24
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): shanghai
- Operating system: ubuntu 20.04

## Steps to Reproduce
Compiling the following json file using `solc --standard-json`:

```json
{
  "language": "Solidity",
  "sources": {
    "./function-debug-info.sol":{
      "content": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\ncontract BadDebugData {\n    address[] public stakes;}"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": {
       "enabled": true,
        "runs": 200
    },
    "evmVersion": "shanghai",
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "*": [
          "abi",
          "evm.deployedBytecode"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Returns the following bytecode:
```
6080604052348015600e575f80fd5b50600436106026575f3560e01c8063d5a44f8614602a575b5f80fd5b60396035366004607b565b6055565b6040516001600160a01b03909116815260200160405180910390f35b5f81815481106062575f80fd5b5f918252602090912001546001600160a01b0316905081565b5f60208284031215608a575f80fd5b503591905056fea2646970667358221220ba99621db5e1a31586b2a5a82bedfa86ba6ad44116ce59ddf26f95b5e4b9fc9664736f6c63430008180033
``` 

and `functionDebugData`:
```json
"functionDebugData":{"@stakes_4":{"entryPoint":85,"id":4,"parameterSlots":0,"returnSlots":0},"abi_decode_tuple_t_uint256":{"entryPoint":123,"id":null,"parameterSlots":2,"returnSlots":1},"abi_encode_tuple_t_address__to_t_address__fromStack_reversed":{"entryPoint":null,"id":null,"parameterSlots":2,"returnSlots":1}}
```

Function `@stakes_4` is reported to take 0 parameters and have 0 returns.
However if we disassemble the relevant blocks we can see that it consumes 1 item from the stack and leaves 1 (or 2) items on it after its execution is completed.

```assembly
   0x55: JUMPDEST  
   0x56: PUSH0     
   0x57: DUP2  // copies previous stack item      
   0x58: DUP2      
   0x59: SLOAD     
   0x5a: DUP2      
   0x5b: LT        // uses copied item
   0x5c: PUSH1     0x62
   0x5e: JUMPI     
   0x5f: PUSH0     
   0x60: DUP1      
   0x61: REVERT    
   0x62: JUMPDEST  
   0x63: PUSH0     
   0x64: SWAP2     
   0x65: DUP3      
   0x66: MSTORE    
   0x67: PUSH1     0x20
   0x69: SWAP1     
   0x6a: SWAP2     
   0x6b: SHA3      
   0x6c: ADD       
   0x6d: SLOAD     
   0x6e: PUSH1     0x1
   0x70: PUSH1     0x1
   0x72: PUSH1     0xa0
   0x74: SHL       
   0x75: SUB       
   0x76: AND       // masks the SLOADed value, leaves it on the stack
   0x77: SWAP1     
   0x78: POP       
   0x79: DUP2      
   0x7a: JUMP      // return jump
```

Thanks for the report! I can confirm that this still happens on 0.8.25. And not only for `shanghai`. At first I thought it could be somehow related to `PUSH0`, but does not seems so.

I think that this may be the culprit: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b61c2a91b3a478bd53fb831b0e8811668bc0dd05/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerContext.cpp#L582-L589

The assumption there may have been that only builtin functions do not have definitions. That's not true - getters don't have them either. Still, just assuming zero does not seem to make much sense for builtins either, so I suspect that there could be other cases affected by this.
