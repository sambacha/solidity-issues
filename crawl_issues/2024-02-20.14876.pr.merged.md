After I run the test command it skips import_base test with "NOT RUN" for an unknown reason

```
~/solidity/build # ./test/tools/isoltest -t smtCheckerTests/imports/import_base*
Running tests...

smtCheckerTests/imports/import_base.sol: NOT RUN

Summary: 0/7598 tests successful (7598 tests skipped).
```

I have fixed the test manually from `der:173-186` to `der:174-187` but haven't run unit test as it's being skipped
