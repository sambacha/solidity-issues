Just quickly went through the comments + the "Implement review feedback." commit - looks great!
So the most important thing left would be to check if those weird non-utf8-escape sequences were valid before this change or just passed through json-cpp, but still triggered an error afterwards. Either way, we may get away with merging it, but I'd at least like to make an informed decision on ignoring it ;-). If I understood correctly earlier today, the comment thing is a non-issue, since there's some flag for it? If so, could that flag then also just be set for the tests? Or https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14877#discussion_r1514913996 sounds like we still need to double-check the current behaviour after all?

Apart from all that, I'd still do one more bottom-up review pass in the next days plus going through https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14877#discussion_r1513028996 at least once a bit more carefully just to make sure, but we might get this merged rather quickly now after all!

I think not.

Yes, exactly. We just see this earlier.

Yes, this is failing now.

I don't think so, but of course it is technically possible. In general NTFS and exFAT seem to use UTF16 encoding for filenames. Where FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 is using OEM character sets (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/intl/character-sets-used-in-file-names?redirectedfrom=MSDN). However, I guess we can ignore that.

However, I was curious about the use of UTF16 on Windows and whether this is really working right now. It turns out we don't support unicode filenames on Windows - because they are UTF16 encoded. For UTF16 encoded filenames that are not just ASCII we are only receiving `?` question mark characters (63 decimal). After investigating this a bit further, I surprisingly only receive these question mark characters using `boost::filesystem::directory_iterator`.

So if we have a contract named `片仮名.sol` we only receive `???.sol`, where `???.sol` is of course not existing and failing to open the contract. (On Mac & Linux this works, because the filesystems used there normally use utf8)
```
←[1m←[31mError←[0m←[1m←[37m: "C:\Users\alex\CLionProjects\untitled1\cmake-build-debug\???.txt" is not found.
←[0m
```

This is the behaviour of our current compiler and it looks like that no windows user ever had a problem with this. So I guess we could really just ignore the use of non-utf8 encoded filenames.

> 
> It's actually also curious that it becomes ``\ufffd`` with json-cpp... does json-cpp try to guess and fix invalid unicode sequences there and reinterprets them as the closest it finds? If so, we could definitely call it a bugfix...

I don't know, but ``\ufffd`` is also an invalid unicode sequence - so json-cpp even didn't fix it. I would say we can consider this as a bugfix.

> But yeah, we should spend a bit more thought about this here and about these cases, but in the end I think we can get away with it.

I added some basic tests for the decoding of standard jsons containing invalid utf8 sequences. When I was investigating the utf16 encoded filenames on Windows I found this bug that I mentioned - but because nobody ever found this, I guess it's ok. 

However, I should probably open an issue for this utf16 filename encoding bug. I also think that it is not worth supporting FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 filesystems correctly.
