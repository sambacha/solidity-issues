## Abstract

In Solidity, the `using ... for ...` syntax enables to load specific functions instead of the whole library, as stated by the documentation.

For instance for the following library with 2 overloaded functions.

```solidity
library LSP2Utils {

    function generateMappingKey(
        string memory firstWord,
        string memory lastWord
    ) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 firstWordHash = keccak256(bytes(firstWord));
        bytes32 lastWordHash = keccak256(bytes(lastWord));

        bytes memory temporaryBytes = bytes.concat(
            bytes10(firstWordHash),
            bytes2(0),
            bytes20(lastWordHash)
        );

        return bytes32(temporaryBytes);
    }

    function generateMappingKey(
        string memory firstWord,
        address addr
    ) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        bytes32 firstWordHash = keccak256(bytes(firstWord));

        bytes memory temporaryBytes = bytes.concat(
            bytes10(firstWordHash),
            bytes2(0),
            bytes20(addr)
        );

        return bytes32(temporaryBytes);
    }
    
    function generateMappingKey(
        bytes10 keyPrefix,
        bytes20 bytes20Value
    ) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        bytes memory generatedKey = bytes.concat(
            keyPrefix,
            bytes2(0),
            bytes20Value
        );
        return bytes32(generatedKey);
    }
    
}
```

In a contract, the 3rd function cannot be imported with the following syntax:

```solidity
// pragma and import statements omitted for brevity

contract Example is {
 
    using {LSP2Utils.generateMappingKey} for bytes10;

}
```

This generates the following error:

```
Identifier is not a function name or not unique.
```

## Motivation

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

Enable to write functions with same name, and load specific ones in a `library`. This prevents from having to refactor the code to change all functions names, which can break compatibility for code bases that are already using some of these overloaded functions.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

To Be Defined. How to specify which function signature to load via `using for`?

This is a known limitation and a more general issue, not limited to just `using for`: #3556. Unfortunately we probably won't get to this before we ship the new type system. It will affect the language syntax and the future of overloading in the language and the solution we'll choose will heavily depend on those.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
