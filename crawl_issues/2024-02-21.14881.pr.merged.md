While working on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14880, I noticed that the ENS external test has been failing silently for quite some time. 

The issue is from the fact that the `detect_hardhat_artifact_dir function` was returning an empty string, causing `bytecode_size_json_from_hardhat_artifacts` to use an incorrect path. This PR addresses that and also another issue within the same external test script, where it was attempting to run `sed` on a directory instead of a file.

```
Skipping test function...
Cannot determine Hardhat artifact location. Both build/ and artifacts/ exist

Hardhat and OpenZeppelin errors should be fixed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14875 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14880 respectively.
