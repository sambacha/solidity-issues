This seems like an oversight from the initial implementation that supported versions such as "^0.4.0" but which now has a side effect of converting individual string literals to their token values, allowing for syntax such as:
- `0 "." 8 "." 0`
- `"1".2.3"`
- `"1"."2"."3"`

and so on.

This fix aims to address the unintentional acceptance of such syntax, primarily to simplify the logic of external parsers and to more clearly establish what constitutes valid syntax for a crucial element like the version pragma statement.

I haven't written C++ in ages, so let me know if I'm doing anything dumb or if it could be written better.

Closes #14826
