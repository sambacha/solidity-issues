# [\#14889 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14889) `closed`: Add blobhash inside the `tx` context: blobhash(uint index) -->  tx.blobhash(uint index)
**Labels**: `feature`

## Abstract / Motivation

The blob hash is an opcode that depends on the transaction, similar to the tx.origin or tx.gasprice. I think it's more consistent to access it inside the tx context

## Specification

Blobhash opcode should be access in solidity like: `tx.blobhash(uint index) returns (bytes32)`

## Backwards Compatibility

An alias could be made to be backwards compatibility but i don't think it's necessary

Hi @invocamanman, thanks for opening the issue, but similarly to `block.blockhash()` which was removed in Solidity version `0.5.0` in favor of the global free function `blockhash()` we prefer to keep `blobhash()` as free function as well.

Hey!^^ thanks for the answer :D

The blockhash is not an opcode depending on the metadata/data of the current executing block, but a opcode that retrieve information from previous blocks of the blockchain. So i think it's accurate to put it outside the block context. 

_( It's true tho that the block number of the current block might depend the execution of this opcode, since only can retrieve the hash of the last 256, but since it's retrieving "other information" than the current executing block, i think it's more accurate the way it is and see the 256 as a limitation)_ 

The blobhash instead make reference only to the current executing transaction. And the `index` is referring to the blobs of the executing transaction as well.

Hi @invocamanman, while I agree with your point about including `blobhash` as a member of `tx`, having these members of global magic variables (e.g. `block`, `tx`, etc) as global free functions would simplify the implementation of our planned Solidity standard library (refer to: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10282 for additional context). Therefore, we prefer to not introduce this feature now, as it would require breaking changes in the near future.

oki ^^  it makes sense

Thanks for the answers ^^
