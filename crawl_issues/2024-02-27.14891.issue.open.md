# [\#14891 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14891) `open`: SMTChecker: Use SMT-LIB interface instead of solvers' APIs
**Labels**: `smt`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-02-27 16:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14891):

This is an issue to keep track on the progress of replacing the usage of solvers' APIs with a unified way of using SMT-LIB interface.

My previous attempt to tackle this is in a PR draft #14369.
However, the task is too large to address in a single PR.
Thus we break it down to smaller steps:
We need to be able to parse responses of the solvers, which means we need to implement a parser for (a reasonable subset of) SMT-LIB format. Then we can support production of invariants and counterexample when using Eldarica.
Afterwards, we can add support for Z3 through SMT-LIB interface. If that works correctly, we can eventually remove Z3 as a library.


```[tasklist]
### Tasks
- [ ] Add support for parsing SMT-LIB
- [ ] Add support for invariants from Eldarica
- [ ] Add support for counterexamples from Eldarica
- [ ] Support Z3 through SMT-LIB interface
- [ ] Switch completely to SMT-LIB interface and drop solvers' libraries
```
