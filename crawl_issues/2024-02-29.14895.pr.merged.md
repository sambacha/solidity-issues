It appears that there may be memory leaks in the external `uniswap` and `perpetual_pools` tests, causing the OOMKiller to be triggered, especially since the Docker images of those have limited RAM (i.e., 2GB). Interestingly, these two external tests do not utilize the latest releases of the respective projects. Therefore, it is likely that the issue is caused by some updated dependency. Perhaps we should refrain from neutralizing the `package.lock` file of those two tests.

It's also fine to just bump the machine size for these two if that solves the problem.

The sizes we currently have are simply the result of my benchmarking in the past - I chose sizes to be exactly what each one needed to get minimal running time at a minimal cost. But in the end, it turned out that the savings from external tests weren't all that significant. All but the most beefy Linux jobs are fairly cheap individually and most of the cost comes from how many of them there are. And the few macOS/Windows runs we have dwarf all that. So as a general rule, it's fine to increase sizes of Linux machines where necessary. Only macOS, Windows and very heavy Linux jobs warrant more careful consideration.
