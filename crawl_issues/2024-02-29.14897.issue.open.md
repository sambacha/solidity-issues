## Environment

- Compiler version: solc 0.8.24
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): foundry

## Steps to Reproduce

Hello! I compiled the following contract using the `via-ir` option. A revert occurred during transaction execution.

```solidity
contract A {
  function f(uint[2] calldata x) public pure returns(uint[2] memory r) {
    assembly  {{ x := 0x24 }}
    r = x;
  }
}
```

If I change the return type of `r` to uint, an out-of-bounds situation similarly occurs. However, after compiling with `via-ir`, the transaction successfully executes and returns `0x0`.

```solidity
contract B {
  function f(uint[2] calldata x) public pure returns(uint r) {
    assembly  {{ x := 0x24 }}
    r = x[1];
  }
}
```

Notably, if I omit the `via-ir` option, both return as expected. Is this a bug? I'm uncertain if this revert is caused by an out-of-bounds check.
