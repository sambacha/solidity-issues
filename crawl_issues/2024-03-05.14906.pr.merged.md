# [\#14906 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14906) `merged`: SMTChecker: Fix usage of Eldarica with SMT callback

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-03-05 12:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14906):

Previously, CHC engine with SMT interface would always call Eldarica if
it was present in the system, regardless whether user specified
`model-checker-solver` as `smtlib2` or `eld`.
Here we make sure Eldarica is called only when it is specified as the
solver of choice.

The proposed solution is to make SMTSolverCommand modifiable and set it
up properly based on the user settings. This requires changes also in
UniversalCallback, because in the compiler we must be able to check if
the given callback is UniversalCallback provided by CommandLineInterface.

This mechanism can be used to migrate also other solvers to the SMTLIB
interface by further extending/adapting SMTSolverCommand.
Its advantage is that meaning of the callback stays the same, thus there
is not need to change anything on the side of solc-js.
