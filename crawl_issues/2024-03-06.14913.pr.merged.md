I'm not sure how many of these we may already have, but since we're changing the return type of the error constructor calls, it'd be good to have a few more tests like calsuchling as a standalone statement `CustomError();` or using in `abi.encode` and as a type in `abi.decode`, passing one to a regular function and so on - maybe also even for uncalled error constructors (``CustomError;`` and passing that around in those cases - we don't need to be too strict there, but it'd be good to see the behaviour in tests anyways, although those we may also already have, I didn't check). The post type checker thing should catch all those calls to error constructors, but better to make sure.

Also maybe a small AST test with just a require-with error call, s.t. we can see if and how the new type shows up there. EDIT: I just saw that there's already one at least where it shows up.

For the docs by the way, it's important to be clear about the fact that the arguments to the error are evaluated unconditionally (like for any regular function call).

We should also have a pathological test case for that like:

```
contract C {
  error E(uint);
  function r() internal returns (uint) {
    assembly { mstore(0, 7) return(0,32) }
    return 42;
  }
  function f() public returns (uint) {
    require(false, E(r());
  }
  function g() public returns (uint) {
    require(true, E(r());
    revert E(42);
  }
}
```
Both calling ``f`` and ``g`` should return ``7`` - no reverts.

We can also point out that that's consistent with a require we already have that takes a string.

We can also further point out that the allocation of the memory for the error-based revert reason will only happen in the reverting pass and that constants and string literals will become optimized, so the "expected" use should remain cheap.

I also just pushed some smaller tweaks as fixups to avoid spamming you with trivial comments. Please take a look and let me know if anything seems off.

> There's one instance of `via-ir` left in `control-structures.rst`.

> Also, in the message above it should really be `compile via IR` as I suggested. That's because we *compile Solidity to bytecode by going through (via) the IR pipeline (IR code generator)*. That's where the term comes from. I guess there are situations where using it as an adverb does not work so somehow we ended up with this horrible `via-IR` thing used as a noun, but something like `compile with via-IR` is one of the exact situations where it would work :) Does it really not bother you as weird?

Uh, were you commenting on an old commit, because I did change this to `via-IR`; I recall you suggesting either `via IR` or `via-IR`, and I picked the latter. I don't really care either way (i.e., no, it does not bother me), so I'll change it to `via IR`.

I was commenting on the script itself, which still has this:

```bash
    if grep "// This will only compile with via-IR" "$f" >/dev/null
```

The change in the docs was fine, just missing in one place.
