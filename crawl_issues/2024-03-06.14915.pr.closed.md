As we agreed on the call, I'm submitting my workaround as a PR, but hopefully @r0qs will come up with a better fix. Mine just massively increases the machine size to make it still work despite the huge memory leak and disables tests that fail due to some non-determinism.

With this workaround here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14919 we don't need to increase the machine sizes.
