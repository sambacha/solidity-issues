**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

All the disabled external tests seem to still compile fine, at most with some minor adjustments. It's only the test suite that is broken. They're still useful for bytecode size benchmarks so I'd like to re-enabled them in a compile-only mode. That would give us more relevant data points for evaluating changes to the optimizer sequence (#14406).

Note that the two broken external tests in CI are unrelated. This PR does not touch any of them. We'll need #14915 or an alternative fix from @r0qs to deal with them. This PR can be merged independent of their status.
