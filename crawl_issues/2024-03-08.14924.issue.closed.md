# [\#14924 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14924) `closed`: Verifying blobhash causes failure to obtain gasLimit
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Use the newly supported `blobhash` opcode to obtain the hash, and determine whether the blob is actually uploaded based on the result. But this will cause `estimateGas` to error because the blob doesn't exist yet.

```
 bytes32 dataHash = blobhash(blobIdx);
 require(dataHash != 0, "failed to get blob hash");
```

Can you provide more details? Is this an error from a framework? Geth?
Are you using a release binary?

We're actually seeing a similar error from some Hardhat projects after switching to `cancun` by default (#4851) but that's not merged yet. It would be useful to know if you're seeing this on 0.8.24 with `cancun` selected or if you're using a build from `develop` with yet unreleased features.

I'm closing this due to not enough information to diagnose and also because we solved the related problem I mentioned above, and it's very likely that this solves it issue too. The solution was that in our external tests we were configuring Hardhat to use `cancun` as the EVM version for the compiler but not for the `hardhat` network. That has to be set separately and currently still defaults to `shanghai` (https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/4851).

If this does not solve the problem for you and you can provide more information, feel free to repoen, but first please make sure it's actually a problem in the compiler and not in the framework you're using. If the latter is more likely, please report there instead.
