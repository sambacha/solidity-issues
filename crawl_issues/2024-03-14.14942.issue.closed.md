## Page

The entire Solidity docs. Example: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.25/

## Abstract

The texts in the Solidity documentation are all rendered with a bold font face.
This makes it hard to read and emphasized content is no longer recognizable as such.

IS (`font-weight: 400`)

SHOULD (`font-weight: 200`):

## Pull request

I'm not sure where the corresponding stylesheet is coming from. The browser dev tools indicate that it must be a file named `theme.css`, but I cannot find it in this repository.

I changed the default body font weight from 400 to 200 at the toggle.css (as per specified on the conf.py: html_css_files = ["css/toggle.css"])

See my comment in the PR here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14944#pullrequestreview-1947555972

I would not change the font weight for the reasons mentioned in my comment. Thus, from my perspective, we can close this issue and the associated PR.
