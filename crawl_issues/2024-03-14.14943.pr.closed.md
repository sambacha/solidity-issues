Implements a piece of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5808.
Verification target for CHC engine will be added in a seperate PR.

> Looks good, I will have to dig a bit deeper into the issue. There is no way for a user to express in Solidity that they are aware about possible truncation and are fine with it? So we would not warn in such cases?

I don't know about that. I'll ask.


> Looking at the tests, I am thinking that maybe this target should not be checked by default, but only when explicitly required? It seems quite verbose, meaning that conversions seem to happen often.

Good idea. I'll fix it.

Narrowing casts are now explicit in solidity. Due to this reason we decided that verification targets that check truncation are no longer needed. It's on a developer to watch out for potential issues if explicit casts are used.
