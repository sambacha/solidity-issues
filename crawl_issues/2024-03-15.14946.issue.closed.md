<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

This is a edge case in command-line arg parsing related to assembly optimization flags: Providing the empty string or a string containing only whitespace to `--yul-optimizations` triggers an uncaught exception. 

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.23 - 0.8.26-develop.2024.3.15+commit.33e33241.mod.Linux.g++
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Default.
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None, triggered on the command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None.
- Operating system: Linux

Not present in 0.8.22, most likely due to the change in command-line parsing introduced in #14657.

## Steps to Reproduce

Executing either (example Yul provided below):
```
solc --strict-assembly --yul-optimizations " " simple.yul
```
or
```
solc --strict-assembly --yul-optimizations "" simple.yul
```

Triggers the exception:
```
Uncaught exception:
/solidity/libyul/YulStack.cpp(179): Throw in function solidity::yul::YulStack::optimize(solidity::yul::Object&, bool)::<lambda()>
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Yul assertion failed
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Yul assertion failed
```

Contrarily:
```
solc --strict-assembly --yul-optimizations ":" simple.yul
```
outputs unoptimized bytecode, as expected:

```
======= simple.yul (EVM) =======

Pretty printed source:
object "object" {
    code {
        {
            sstore(0, f(1, 2))
            return(0, 32)
        }
        function f(a, b) -> c
        { c := add(a, b) }
    }
}


Binary representation:
6009600260016010565b5f5560205ff35b019056

Text representation:
    /* "simple.yul":145:152   */
  tag_2
    /* "simple.yul":150:151   */
  0x02
    /* "simple.yul":147:148   */
  0x01
    /* "simple.yul":145:152   */
  tag_1
  jump	// in
tag_2:
    /* "simple.yul":142:143   */
  0x00
    /* "simple.yul":135:153   */
  sstore
    /* "simple.yul":182:184   */
  0x20
    /* "simple.yul":179:180   */
  0x00
    /* "simple.yul":172:185   */
  return
    /* "simple.yul":35:115   */
tag_1:
    /* "simple.yul":86:95   */
  add
    /* "simple.yul":35:115   */
  swap1
  jump	// out
```

If the `--optimize` flag is added, the behavior is also as expected:
```
solc --strict-assembly --optimize --yul-optimizations "" simple.yul
```
which outputs the optimized bytecode.

Here's the contents of `simple.yul` used above, but this issue should be triggered regardless of input:
```
{
    function f(a, b) -> c {
        c := add(a, b)
    }

    sstore(0, f(1, 2))
    return(0, 32)
}
```

Thanks for the report @danceratopz, this one is legit. Technically, we should have been more explicit as to what an empty optimizer sequence is (especially when the Yul optimizer is disabled) - i.e. `":"` or just `:`, since this will set both the optimizer *and* the clean up sequence to empty.

In any case, this should fail in the CLI/standard JSON portion with a sensible error message, and not cause an ICE in the YulStack. Thankfully, it should be a trivial fix, and available in the next release.

Thanks again!
