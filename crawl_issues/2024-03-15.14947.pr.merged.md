Launchpad no longer accepts packages targeting Lunar. I got this message during the release yesterday:

```
Subject: [~ethereum/ubuntu/ethereum] solc_0.8.25-0ubuntu1~lunar_source.changes (Rejected)
From: Launchpad PPA <noreply@launchpad.net>
Date: 14 Mar 2024, 13:40

Rejected:
lunar is obsolete and will not accept new uploads.

solc (1:0.8.25-0ubuntu1~lunar) lunar; urgency=low

  * git build of b61c2a91

===
```

This PR removes it from the distribution list in our scripts.
