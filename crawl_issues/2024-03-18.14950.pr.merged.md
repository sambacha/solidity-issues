This PR updates the precompiled contract address range noted in the ["Introduction to Smart Contracts"](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.25/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#precompiledcontracts) page from:

> ... between `1` and (including) `8` ...

to:

> ... between `1` and (including) `0x0a` ...

to reflect the [`blake2f` (`0x09`)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-152) and [`point evaluation` (`0x0a`)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#point-evaluation-precompile) precompiles.
