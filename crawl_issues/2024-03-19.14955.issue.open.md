## Abstract

Example: the file https://binaries.soliditylang.org/macosx-amd64/list.json should itself have a version information. 

## Motivation

The latest release of `solc` had a re-publishing of the macos binary, see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.25 

It would be helpful for tools that may cache this list information to know if there was a change that occured that did not include a new semver update (i.e. a new solc release).

## Specification

Use some sort of `calver` or number to make it clear.
