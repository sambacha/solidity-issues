Hi, thank you for you contribution, but this is a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14849 and we are actually thinking of dropping the dates from the copyright notices as mentioned here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14849#issuecomment-1941283296. So I will be closing this issue until we decide on what way to go.
