This adds a very basic test to verify that Eldarica can be used as the CHC backend.

Depends on #14964.

My original idea was to create only a couple of CLI tests. I plan to add tests for computing invariants and counterexamples when I implement that functionality.

But if we have Eldarica available both on Ubuntu and OSX, maybe I can add also some SMTCheckerTests that will target Eldarica specifically. I will have to check if that will be possible.
