Are there any tests for non-determinism like running in a loop and checking that each compilation of the same source unit results in the same bytecode?

What you're describing is fully deterministic already - i.e. the same sources will always compile to the same bytecode - the issue here is of a different sort; we use a ton of associative containers (e.g. a `std::set` which typically uses a red black tree underneath) to track values (e.g. generated IR variable names) during the optimization stages, and these can sometimes (extremely rarely) change if you insert an unrelated contract that is unused in the rest of the sources (in this case it's an empty dummy contract) which then causes the order of the elements in such containers to be different than without the said unrelated contract/sources. This is what creates the inconsistency in bytecode, and is what this PR fixes.

These inconsistencies don't actually change the behavior of contracts - the code will semantically remain the same, but the bytecode in such cases should none the less be identical, especially when it comes to source verification.

Given how easy it is to inadvertently run into this problem when using `YulString` with associative containers, I wonder if we can do something to prevent them in the future. Maybe we could e.g. create wrappers over `set<YulString>` and `map<YulString>` that remove any support for iterating them and add a "style" rule preventing the use of unwrapped containers?

@cameel this should be ready now.
