# [\#14972 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14972) `closed`: Standard ERC-721 "name" and "symbol" function error with Cancun EVM
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description:

The standard ERC-721 functions `name `and `symbol `intended to return strings throw an "invalid opcode: MCOPY" error when compiling with the Cancun EVM, while working correctly with the Shanghai EVM.

## Expected Behavior:

The `name `and symbol `functions `should return string values regardless of the target EVM version.



## Environment:

Compiler version: ^0.8.20
Target EVM version: Cancun (as specified in compiler settings)
Framework/IDE: Remix
Operating System: (Not relevant to this issue)


## Steps to Reproduce:

Use a standard ERC-721 contract with name and symbol functions.
Compile the contract in Remix with the Cancun EVM version selected.
Deploy the contract to a blockchain.
Attempt to call the name or symbol function. This will result in the "invalid opcode: MCOPY" error.



## Additional Notes:

The same contract compiles and functions correctly when using the Shanghai EVM version.
This suggests a potential incompatibility between the generated bytecode for Cancun and the expected opcodes by the EVM.

This looks like you are using version 0.8.25, which sets the target to cancun by default, and uses mcopy, but you try to run the contract on a non-cancun chain (that doesn't support this opcode).

Said otherwize, the issue is not in the compiler itself, but in the fact that you use a recent version of the compiler with an older version of the EVM.

Since you are using Remix, you should make sure that you use `Remix VM (Cancun)` selected. Note: it doesn't work on my machine, maybe a remix bug.

An alternative is to set the target to an older version of the EVM (shanghai or earlier)

this currently also happens to anyone running `geth --dev` because it does not have cancun support yet, unfortunately.

@developer-decuple Thanks for raising this here. Howerver, as described by @Amxx and @q9f in their comments, this is not a bug in the compiler but rather an issue with Remix and Geth.

For further support, consider reporting this to the respective projects.
