Fixes #14287

TODO:
- [ ] code deducpliation between `typeCheckABIEncodeCallFunction` and `typeCheckABIEncodeErrorFunction` ?
  - I'm not sure if there is a clean way of doing that. Considering there is already a lot of code duplication in the codebase, maybe that is ok.
- [x] tests
- [ ] review

Yes, i'm still working on the testing part.

Edit: should be good now

Apparently, in the semantic tests, the returned `bytes memory` are processed in chunks of 32 bytes. So when the buffer has `length â‰¡ 4 mod 0x20`, we need to pad the expected output with zeros (28 bytes worth of zero exactly)

Is that supposed to happen?

Could be just another instance of #13989. The issue is about fixed bytes, but maybe it affects `bytes` too.
I think that soltest is just not padding byte arrays correctly.

@matheusaaguiar 
- I added some references in the files you mentionned
- I fixed the merge conflicts and fixed what needed to be fixed
- I also merged previous functions into `typeCheckABIEncodeCallFunctionOrError` (added the type object and some switches)

Pending the discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14287#issuecomment-2096501517, we decided to close this PR for now. But feel free to jump in there (or join one of our calls) and make the case for this approach and we can potentially revisit and revive this PR!
But as a general policy, we should discuss and confirm the approach before implementations, to be sure we're on the same page about it.

@ekpyron [This change to ERC-7751](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7751-wrapping-of-bubbled-up-reverts/20740/3?u=amxx), if it was to happen (note, I'm a co-author of the ERC, so not unlikelly), would create a significant usecase of `abi.encodeError`.

Depending on the feedback this gets, I'd like to reconsider this feature.
