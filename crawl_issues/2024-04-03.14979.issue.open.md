**Labels**: `feature`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2432299?v=4" width="50">[Amxx](https://github.com/Amxx) opened issue at [2024-04-03 20:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14979):

## Abstract

Add support for the following syntax:

```solidity
abi.encodeCall(fnPointer, { arg1: 1, arg2: 2 });
```

## Motivation

It is currently possible to call a function, or throw a custom error, using this syntax:
```solidity
target.fn({ arg1: 1, arg2: 2 });
revert E({ arg1: 1, arg2: 2 });
```
it would be nice to have the same syntax supported for `abi.encodeCall`

## Specification

The compiler already know how to encode the call when doing `target.fn({ arg1: 1, arg2: 2 });`. The idea is to reuse the same argument encoding logic, and return the encoded data without performing the call

## Backwards Compatibility

No issue.
