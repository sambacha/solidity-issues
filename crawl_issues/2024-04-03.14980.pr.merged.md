# [\#14980 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14980) `merged`: SMTChecker: Relax assertions regarding sort compatibility when creating expressions

This finishes the work started by #14180, which relaxed most of the assertions related to checking compatibility of sorts to allow mixing signed and unsigned `Int` sorts. 

This PR has two parts:
1. Introduces a helper method that expresses the intent of the check and replaces if-then-else branches with this method call.
2.  Relaxes one more assertion: in creating array store expression, we are checking if the array's domain sort and access index sort are compatible instead of equal.

Fixes #14792.

@matheusaaguiar , I renamed the test, added a mapping with `bytes` and an array. Also added a changelog entry.

Do you think we can merge this?
