<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
The contract involves assigning a function-type variable, followed by compilation using four different types: 'origin', 'optimize', 'viaIr', and 'optimize-viaIr'. Upon executing the four sets of bytecode, inconsistencies in **storage** are observed.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE: Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: None

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.

```
contract C {
    function() internal returns (uint) a;
    function set() public returns (uint256 ret) {
        a = set;
        assembly{
            ret:=sload(0)
        }
    }
}
```

Hey @Subway2023! Thanks for raising the question.

The difference/"inconsistency" in the storage layout that you notice here is caused due to the fact that the IR-codegen represents internal function pointers differently from the old codegen. The old code generator uses code offsets or tags for values of internal function pointers. Whereas in the IR codegen, function pointers use internal IDs that are allocated in sequence.

For reference, you can check out the Solidity docs that describe this [difference between the two codegens](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/ir-breaking-changes.html#internal-function-pointers).
