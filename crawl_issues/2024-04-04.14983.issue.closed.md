## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
[0.7.4 release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases?page=3) claims that the SMTChecker supports the keccak256 function. However, SMTChecker cannot accurately assess the output value of keccak256.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE: Remix and Command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
```
-->
```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public {
        bytes memory t0="1";
        bytes memory t1="1";
        bytes32 a=keccak256(t0);
        bytes32 b=keccak256(t1);
        assert(a==b);
    }
}
```
