<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

AST import leads to inconsistent bytecode.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE: Command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public returns (bytes32) {
        return address(this).codehash;
    }
}
```
### 1. Get ast json
```
solc C.sol --combined-json ast >> C.json
```
### 2. Get bin-runtime by importing ast
```
solc  --bin-runtime --import-ast C.json
```
```

```
### 3. Get bin-runtime by directly compiling
```
solc  --bin-runtime C.sol
```
```

```
### 4. Compare
The bytecode obtained from two methods differs, resulting in different return values for this function **f()**

The difference comes from the metadata hash embedded in the runtime bytecode. You can verify that the contract code is the same by telling the compiler to skip the hash:

```bash
diff --unified \
    <(solc --bin-runtime --import-ast C.json --metadata-hash none) \
    <(solc --bin-runtime              C.sol  --metadata-hash none)
```

And metadata is different because it includes the hash and type of the source file. With AST import you get `language: "SolidityAST"` and the source is considered to be the JSON AST, not the source (which the compiler no longer has access to). You can use that by using the `--metadata-literal` flag and requesting `--metadata` - the metadata will then include the actual sources rather than just their hashes.

So this is not a bug - it was designed that way. Still, it's not a great design. Ideally, you'd be able to get the same exact output, including metadata, no matter whether you compile directly from Solidity source or do multi-stage compilation with separate AST, Yul or EVM assembly import. We'd like to change that but this will be a breaking change and will require careful consideration to do it properly. I'll leave the issue open for the time being and describe our current idea below, but keep in mind that it's something we won't be addressing in the near future.

### Redesigned multi-stage metadata
The current idea is to introduce proper separation between stages inside the compiler, with each one starting and stopping at a well defined artifact rather than continuing using internal structures.

Currently the default mode of operation is for the compiler to use those internal structures as canonical input for each stage, with import/export of that data being tacked on later, often without too careful validation. This means that resuming compilation from a later stage is not *exactly* identical to doing it in one go. It's hard to guarantee that no optional bits of data are omitted on export and there's no strong barrier against later stages reaching into the data from earlier ones that would be unavailable in multi-stage compilation (being able to access the original source is an example of that). A better design would be for the state to be always exported at the end of each stage and for the next stage to start by importing it.

This would also require adjusting the structure of metadata. Currently we assume that complete metadata is always available after the analysis stage. Each stage should instead be able to accept partial metadata and add to it, with complete metadata being available only at the very end.
