<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

When assigning a value using assembly that exceeds the variable type range, it gets truncated by the IR-based Code Generator, causing inconsistency in bytecode execution compared to the bytecode generated by the regular Code Generator.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE: Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: None

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public returns (uint256) {
        uint16 x = 0xffff;
        uint8 y = uint8(x);
        uint256 r;
        assembly {
            r := y
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```
### Four compilation modes
origin, optimize, viaIr, optimize-viaIr. Specific configuration details can be found at the [four compilation configuration ](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14982)
### Run in EVM and Get Output
#### origin/optimize

#### viaIr and optimize-viaIr

Due to the fact that IR-based Code Generator truncates overflow values, the return value of **f()** is different in different compilation modes.

Hey @Subway2023!

This result is due to the difference in the old codegen and the IR-based codegen cleanup sequence and is not a bug. See for the instance [the Cleanup example in the Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/ir-breaking-changes.html#cleanup) to understand this better.

Hence, I will be closing this issue. :)

```
uint8 y = uint8(x);
```
Why does the mandatory conversion here fail.
