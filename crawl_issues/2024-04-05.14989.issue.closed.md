    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description
[0.8.14 release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases?page=2) claims that the SMTChecker supports the abi.encodeCall. However, when using abi.encodeCall to encode function, SMTChecker will crash

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix and Command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C {
    function f()public {
        bytes memory result=abi.encodeCall(this.f, ());
        assert(result.length==4);
    }
}
```
### Remix

Successfully executed.
### Command-line
```bash
solc C.sol --model-checker-ext-calls trusted --model-checker-timeout 0 --model-checker-engine chc --model-checker-solvers z3
```
or

```bash
solc C.sol --model-checker-ext-calls trusted --model-checker-timeout 0 --model-checker-engine bmc --model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations 10 --model-checker-solvers z3
```

SMTChecker crash

I can't reproduce it using code from current develop branch.
Looks like it was fixed recently.

After running solc, the output I get is:
```

and

Note: Counterexample:
  result.length = 5
  this = 22
