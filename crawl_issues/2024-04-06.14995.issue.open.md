## Description

The compiler segfaults when trying to compile a really long tuple assignment with ```--via-ir```, tested with latest solc version ```0.8.25```. The attached program has 1750 variables in a single variable declaration statement but it doesn't have to be this number necessarily. I don't know if this is something that the team would want to investigate, but in any case I thought to open this issue.

```
solc --asm --via-ir testcase.sol
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: ```0.8.25```

Hi @alex1448 and sorry for the late reply. Would you mind uploading the testcase file to a GH gist, we'd prefer not to download random zips?

Hello @nikola-matic, no worries and thank you for the reply. Sure, I created a GH gist, here is the link:

By the way, I would also like to add that obviously this testcase is not something that can occur in a real program, but I thought that it possibly exposes some otherwise hidden issue within the compiler.
