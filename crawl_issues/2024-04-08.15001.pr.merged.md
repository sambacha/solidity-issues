Just realized that it's also missing a changelog entry. Is it because it's considered experimental at this point?

I guess I always forget about the changelog entry :sweat_smile:

Well, it's actually a good question whether it should have an entry. The feature is not really usable to users in the current state so not much point advertising it. On the other hand we do include an entry when an experimental feature is introduced (just not when we change it), so maybe we should still have it.

Also, it's not so much experimental as just incomplete...

@cameel , I have restricted the parser to only accept `transient` for state variables now. There were some tests from before which are kinda useless right now, but I guess they will come in handy later when we allow `transient` for other kinds of variable.
