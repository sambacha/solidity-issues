Implicit/Explicit conversion from string/hex string literals to bytesNNs are allowed. [hex_string_to_bytesNN_different_size_explicit.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e54110ff173f8903acc098f25a416085d9e507ae/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/types/hex_string_to_bytesNN_different_size_explicit.sol) shows that these conversions are allowed.

Fixed wrong documentation of type conversion.

Added test case for checking implicit conversion from string/hex string literals to bytesNNs.
