## Description

When switching from 0.8.24 to 0.8.25 the compiler fails with "Assembly exception for bytecode":

```
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 229 files with 0.8.25
[⠑] Solc 0.8.25 finished in 4.65s
Error: 
Compiler run failed:
Error: Internal compiler error (/solidity/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp:1410):Assembly exception for bytecode
InternalCompilerError: Assembly exception for bytecode
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: **0.8.25**
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): **paris**
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): **foundry**
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: **during compilation**
- Operating system: **MacOS Ventura 13.6**
- via_ir: **true**

## Steps to Reproduce

I don't know which part of the code reproduces the bug exactly, but it can be reproduces by cloning and trying to compile Lens Protocol public repo:

1. git clone https://github.com/lens-protocol/core.git
2. forge install
3. edit "foundry.toml" to change the `solc_version` to "0.8.25" and uncomment `via_ir = true` line to enable compilation **via_ir**
4. build with `forge b --skip test` (skipping tests to make it faster)

Switching `solc_version` to "0.8.24" makes it compile again (so that's the latest working version).
Turning **via_ir** off also makes it compile - so the problem is using both: `0.8.25` and `via_ir=true`

An ICE is not really something that you should be seeing, so it does look like a bug. Looking a bit further into it, the assertion that's triggered is [this one](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L1088).

Was likely introduced [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14864/files#diff-786911c6e3eab4698a9fab73ced71946ad895b439784b26b05a0321c2ae0e9ceR903) for the 0.8.25 release.

We discussed it on the chat today and it seems to be a regression introduced by the fix for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14863. @ekpyron's diagnosis sounds very plausible:

> But yeah, before https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14864 we generally overallocated the tag sizes - after that PR, we rely on the code size estimate to be accurate (as in: precise or overestimating) - which is probably broken in a few corner cases (I've seen some in the PUSH0 PR even IIRC) - which would break with that assert in some corner cases - that's my best guess.

Also, regarding the possibility that it's 0.8.24 that is broken and the assertion wasn't being triggered due to incorrect code being generated:

> In fact the miscalculation we had in that code before could have lead to something quite similar to that (i.e. allocating too small of space for tags and then just overwriting code when inserting them), but we did already have assertions against that back then

Overall, this is all still speculation since the repro is quite unwieldy (it's a whole repo - a small snippet would be much more helpful) so we'll need to confirm this before fixing, but it's probably correct considering all the info we have so far.

Finally, this bug also highlights a small related issue, i.e. that "assembly exception" for some reason does not include the original message from the assertion that @nikola-matic pointed at. Having it there would have made things clearer from the beginning. We should fix that too.

I have this exact same issue with [Balancer V3](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo).

I am using via-ir with the default optimizing steps in 0.8.24 which works fine; 0.8.25 and 0.8.26 do not.
To reproduce, run build instructions (yarn && yarn build) from [this commit](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/commit/0454bf87134e882d8c0241ba7f076afef2d92837).

I've narrowed down the problem to the [Vault package](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/tree/solidity-0.8.26/pkg/vault), and curiously the contract that is causing the problem seems to be [VaultExplorer](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/0454bf87134e882d8c0241ba7f076afef2d92837/pkg/vault/contracts/VaultExplorer.sol), which is rather simple in comparison to the rest. That branch works if VaultExplorer is deleted from the files or compiled with 0.8.24 as in [here](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/commit/faceafea42cc98f797fb9d976c6f8112e142f248).

Hope this helps as a clue! I'd love to have this fixed.

I can confirm that this no longer happens on the current `develop`, so it seems that #15354 must have fixed it.

On 0.8.26 it was indeed reproducible with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lens-protocol/core.git
cd core/
forge install
forge build \
    --use 0.8.26 \
    --optimize \
    --via-ir \
    --evm-version cancun \
    --no-cache \
    --skip test
```
```

@jubeira Your case seems to be resolved too on `develop`.

Repro instructions directly with `solc` 0.8.26:

The will be released as a part of 0.8.27, some time next week.

By the way, @jubeira, looks like you're using the default sequence from 0.8.25, I'm assuming to avoid the "Stack too deep" errors. You should be able to avoid them by making your assembly memory-safe. Have you tried that?

Thanks for the fix and the hint! We'll give it a shot; we've added `memory-safe` directives only very recently.

Just for the record: the code does not compile with 0.8.26 with via-IR and the new default optimization steps (stack too deep error). All assembly blocks are memory safe as far as I can tell now, so it might be something else.

The previous optimization sequence from 0.8.24/5 does work.

Does the error also say `memoryguard was present`? If it doesn't, there's still something that prevents the compiler from using stack-to-memory mover, which is the mechanism through which the compiler addresses StackTooDeep in the hardest cases for now. There are some things other than unsafe assembly that could prevent it from kicking in, e.g. recursive functions, though the assembly is the most common cause.

But yeah, unfortunately there are still some rare cases in which even with stack-to-memory mover the Yul->EVM transform is unable to generate code and it could just as well be one of those. The change of the sequence did expose some of those in code that was on the verge of running into StackTooDeep due to stack pressure (though it also helped resolve StackTooDeep in other cases so it's a wash). We're working on improving the transform to address these cases, but if you're running into this then I guess using the old sequence is probably the simplest workaround.
