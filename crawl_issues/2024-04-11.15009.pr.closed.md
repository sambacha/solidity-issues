This is needed in the context of `ethdebug`. I will need to write some tests on how optimiser steps are dealing with the debug attributes defined by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14857.  The ideas is to implement different PRs per optimiser step on top of  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14969, where this PR will enable the visualisation how these debug attributes got potentially merged - depending on the optimiser step.

For context, see e.g. #15087.

> I see this is pretty much an exact copy of `YulOptimizerTest.h` at this point, so I assume it's unfinished. What is actually the idea behind this test? Just displaying the assembly next to the optimized Yul or something more?

Just to answer this: the target here is to test the transport of the debugging context through any individual optimizer step and then to assembly (which is from where we'll output them in the end)

In any case, doesn't hurt to have, and not too much of a headache to just merge.
