## Description

Unable to correctly determine that the current balance is 0 after transferring out all balances.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C{
  address payable recipient;
  function f() public {
      bool success = recipient.send(address(this).balance);
      if (success) {
          assert(address(this).balance==0);
      }
  }
}
```

```
solc C.sol --model-checker-engine all
```

If you add the assumption that the recipient is different from the sender, `require(recipient != address(this));`, SMTChecker will prove that assertion holds.

While we could improve the analysis for this particular example, it is also not very realistic, because `recipient` here is always `0`.
In general, you would want to make sure that you are not sending to yourself.
