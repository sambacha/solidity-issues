## Description
When the transfer amount is 0, SMTChecker incorrectly determines insufficient balance
## Environment

- Compiler version:
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C{
    address payable recipient;
    uint amount=0;

    function f() public {
        uint tempAmount = address(this).balance ;
        recipient.transfer(tempAmount);
        recipient.transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

```
solc-0825 C.sol --model-checker-engine all
```

This is again the problem with BMC not tracking the state of the contract.
Since it is doing only a local check, it does not know that the state variable `amount` is always `0` and cannot change.
So this is not a bug, but false positive due to BMC's over-approximating modeling.

The problem is that CHC currently does not attempts to verify the verification target `Insufficient funds for transfer`.
But maybe it should.
