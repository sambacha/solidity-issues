**Labels**: `smt`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147013944?v=4" width="50">[Subway2023](https://github.com/Subway2023) opened issue at [2024-04-12 13:11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15016):

## Description

When performing a push() operation on an empty array, SMTChecker is unable to correctly determine that its value is 0

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
contract C {
  bytes s;
  function f() public {
      s.push();
      assert(s[0]==0x0);
  }
}
```

```
solc C.sol --model-checker-engine bmc
```

BMC engine does not work with the state of the contract, it only analyzes functions locally, so it cannot verify this assertion.
CHC engine is more powerful and can verify this example successfully.

Will BMC support state of the contract in the future

Most likely no.
The recommendation is to use CHC engine, which should be more powerful in almost most cases.
