## Description
SMTChecker is unable to determine whether the decoded value after using abi.decode is equal to the initial value encoded using abi.encode.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): No restrictions
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Command-line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C{    
  function f() public{
      bytes memory corrupt = abi.encode(uint(1));
      uint decoded = abi.decode(corrupt, (uint));
      assert(decoded==1);
  }
}
```
```
solc C.sol --model-checker-engine all
```

SMTChecker cannot model precisely what ABI methods like `encode` and `decode` compute.
To stay sound, it over-approximates the possible behaviour.
This means that it only models the basic functional property: they yield equal output for equal inputs.
Otherwise, it assumes that the result can be any value.
This results in false positives that you see in this issue, but keeps the encoding sane.
