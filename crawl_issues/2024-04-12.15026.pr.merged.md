# [\#15026 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15026) `merged`: Clean up tab-space soup
**Labels**: `refactor`

We have quite a few sloppy chunks of code that mix spaces and tabs or use tabs for alignment, which often makes the code really annoying to work with. I wanted to clean this up many times but thought it wasn't worth the big diff. But if we're going to clean this up wholesale for  `InteractiveTests.h` in #15009, we may just as well do it in other places too and be done with it.

This could cause some conflicts, but I think it won't be that many since this mess is mostly in places we touch rarely (otherwise it would be gone already). If any PR is significantly I'm willing to even rebase it myself if it means finally getting rid of this.

Note: the PR should be pretty easy to review if you enable the option to ignore whitespace :)
