This PR adds initial support for parsing invariants, computed by CHC solver, in SMT-LIB format.

This is done in a few separate steps (found in individual commits):

1. Introduction of a basic SMT-LIB parser that parses string representation and creates S-expression representation. This parser was originally developed by @chriseth (for solsmt) and we only updated it slightly to handle malformed SMT-LIB strings.
2. Instructing Eldarica to produce model (invariants) when this is requested by the user.
3. Reorganization of where we remember declared SMT-LIB sorts. This is necessary for proper parsing of the solver response and creation of our representation of the invariants.
4. The actual translation from SMT-LIB S-expressions to our `Expression` representation of the invariants.

**Note:** This is only initial support and will require more iterations as we add more tests.

The failing tests have been fixed by the way, you just need to rebase.

@nikola-matic , @pgebal , I fixed the code according to your suggestions, or at least commented on your comments :)
So, this should be ready for another round.

@blishko the code looks good to me
