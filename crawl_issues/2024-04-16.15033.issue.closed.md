# [\#15033 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15033) `closed`: Avoid tab-space mix in compiler output
**Labels**: `low effort`, `low impact`, `nice to have`, `closed due inactivity`, `stale`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-04-16 13:12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15033):

After #15026 there remain two sources of random tabs in the sources we store in the repo:
- SMTChecker includes indentation in its source locations so it's also included in code snippets.
- Jump labels in `--asm` output are prepended with a tab.

I think either of those is unnecessary and removing them would make automatic style checks simpler (less files to exclude). Not only for us but for anyone storing this output in their repository.

Still, this is more of an annoyance than a real issue so I don't expect that we'll work on it any time soon. I'm submitting an issue more to document what I discovered while addressing #15026 than to get someone to actually work on it.

### Tabs in SMTChecker output
This happens only if the input file is indented 

`test.sol`
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity *;

contract C {
    function f() public {
		assert    ( false )    ;    
    }
}
```
Note that the assert line has leading and trailing tabs.

```bash
solc test.sol --model-checker-engine all
```
```
Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure
 --> test.sol:5:5:
  |
5 |     function f() public {
  |     ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).

Warning: CHC: Assertion violation happens here.
Counterexample:


Transaction trace:
C.constructor()
C.f()
 --> test.sol:6:3:
  |
6 | 		assert    ( false )    ;    
  | 		^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```
Note that the assert line is included as is, including the leading and trailing indentation. The `^^^^^` marker repeats that indentation too.

### Tab as separator in jump labels
```bash
solc test.sol --asm
```
```
    tag_3:
      tag_4
      tag_5
      jump	// in
    tag_4:
      stop
    tag_5:
        /* "test.sol":109:114  false */
      0x00
        /* "test.sol":97:116  assert    ( false ) */
      tag_7
      jumpi
      tag_8
      tag_9
      jump	// in
```
Note that `jump	// in` includes a tab character as a separator. It seems to be a deliberate decision made in #1330: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b61c2a91b3a478bd53fb831b0e8811668bc0dd05/libevmasm/AssemblyItem.cpp#L331-L338
The PR does not have any justification for that decision though and it seems to me that using a space there would work just as well.

@cameel is this a good first issue? I'd like to work on this, since it seems sufficiently self-contained

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
