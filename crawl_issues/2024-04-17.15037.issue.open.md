**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.25/yul.html#verbatim

## Problem

The current documentation does not say much about the potential use cases for `verbatim`. My understanding is that this syntax was added in order for Optimism to avoid having to maintain a fork of solc. This seems like a problem that many rollups/ L2s will encounter, and so I think it should be more explicitly documented.

Furthermore, it would be helpful to add a note about why this syntax is unavailable in inline assembly, and why it will remain so in the near future.

## More Context

I've asked some questions about `verbatim` in the Matrix server, which have been answered by @cameel. His answers would be a good starting point for an updated documentation:

I've added it to our focus board so it doesn't get lost, but consider this triaged.

@nikola-matic, is this issue still going to be taken care of?

Heya @IaroslavMazur, I've removed the stale label from the issue. We'll get to it eventually, but at the moment we're working on a verbatim blog post (amongst other things, most recently we released a via-ir blog post) precisely because the community keeps asking about it, and we figure that initially we'll have greater reach with said blog post; of course, all of the relevant info will end up in the docs.

Thank you for the update, Nikola.

Glad to hear that the 'verbatim' instruction is going to be documented better!

Hey, @nikola-matic, could you, please, remove the 'stale' label again?
