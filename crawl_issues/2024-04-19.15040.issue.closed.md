**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

The documentation says that `'*'` will produce all available outputs:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2e8cd3f594359b648f79145ba63cb5d0a6233f5f/docs/using-the-compiler.rst#L406-L407

I found this not to be the case, as confirmed by this line here:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2e8cd3f594359b648f79145ba63cb5d0a6233f5f/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L297-L298
