### Feature Description

Added binary number literal to solidity. Below works.

```solidity
contract Test {
    bytes1 constant a = 0b01011010;
    function binaryTest() public {
        uint b = 0b101;
        uint c = 0b10101_101_10101;
        uint256 d = 0b1011 * 1 days;
        bytes4 e = 0b0; // zero value only allowed for implicit conversion
        // bytes2 f = 0b000011110000111100001111; // error, rvalue too big
        bytes3 g = 0b1111000011111111_000_00000;
        // uint16 h = 0b101__111; // error, Only one consecutive underscores between digits allowed
        // bytes6 i = 0b101; // error, Type int_const 5 is not implicitly convertible to expected type bytes6
    }
}
```

Syntax rules referred from hex number literals. Please check ANTLR rules and docs for exact behavior.

### Tests

Mirrored all hex related tests, and added binary number literal related test if necessary. Please suggest if i missed anything.

### Design

I manually implemented parsing binary strings to `u256`. Currently [boost's multi precision lib](https://github.com/boostorg/multiprecision), which is the dependency for solidity does not support binary parsing. Solidity internally uses `u256` type, so I parsed manually.

### New Errors

`5146_error` is introduced.
```cpp
	if (_literal.isBinNumber() && _literal.subDenomination() != Literal::SubDenomination::None)
		m_errorReporter.fatalTypeError(
			5146_error,
			_literal.location(),
			"Binary numbers cannot be used with unit denominations. "
			"You can use an expression of the form \"0b1011 * 1 days\" instead."
		);
```

Hi @pcw109550, we had another call today where we discussed this feature (PR), and decided that we ultimately won't be merging it. @ekpyron explained it in the public channel on matrix [here](https://matrix.to/#/!poXqlbVpQfXKWGseLY:gitter.im/$0iBLr0QPokBkoZw7A7EB7pglzgO2e-H_jnQInSZ2DZA?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=ethereum.org):

> The underlying issue for that PR wasn't closed without reason: we've not established that this will make for a worthwhile extension of the language. We generally need to be careful when introducing features to the language, since they will require support for compilation directly (for which the PR likely does fine), but also support from other components of the compiler (like the SMTChecker) and from tooling - furthermore any future revision of the language will need to account for this as well forever - those are ongoing costs, since we won't be able to easily remove features again after being introduced. That's why we redirected the issue to the forum, s.t. we could revisit it, if and only if there is strong demand for it, which hasn't exactly manifested there either. We probably should have been clearer about that from the start, sorry about that, but it's always better to confirm with us before starting to implement features.

I'm really sorry, since the PR itself is great work and does implement the feature properly - i.e. the quality of your work is not being questioned, rather, the feature itself does not really seem to have strong demand from the community, and it would set a fairly bad precedent if were to allow merging of features that have not been decided as necessary/wanted.

Again, apologies for the inconvenience, and I hope this won't deter you from contributing further to Solidity, just make sure to ask before starting implementation whether the feature you want to work on is needed at the moment.
