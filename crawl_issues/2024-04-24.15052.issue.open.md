## Description
I used the 0.5.9 compiler in Remix to compile the program with an error, but I was able to successfully compile using binary solc


## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.9
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): None
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Remix, Command-Line
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract test {
    uint[2][] public originalData;
    uint[2][] public decodedData;
    function encodeData() public returns (uint) {

        originalData.push([1, 2]);
        originalData.push([3, 4]);
        originalData.push([5, 6]);

        bytes memory encodedData=abi.encode(originalData);

        decodedData = abi.decode(encodedData, (uint[2][]));

        return decodedData[1][1];
    }
}
```

Hey @Subway2023! Thanks for reporting this.

Generally, this issue occurs if the import callback passed to solc-js has an error, but you catch it and continue using the compiler. Throwing exceptions in the callback is invalid. See https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/issues/675#issuecomment-1402098960 for more context.

We need to check whether this is solely an issue of Remix throwing an exception in import callback or if some other bug exists on the application side i.e. Remix (in which case, I would be inclined to close this issue and suggest you open an issue in the Remix codebase).

Could you please share a brief, self-contained code snippet that we can reproduce to understand this better? We aren't able to reproduce the snippet you've provided originally.
