This is a bit of cleanup that I did while updating optimizer docs. I separated it from the main PR because it makes actual semantic changes harder to see. It should also be much easier to review.

Main corrections:
- Add missing backticks.
- Use consistent style for step naming (capitalized, without spaces, without backticks).
- Correct minor text errors like missing plurals.

I don't really care if they're camel case or normal text either, just that it's only one and used consistently. Otherwise searching for them is annoying (have to do it twice each time) and also when updating docs I'm unnecessarily wasting time wondering which one I should use.
