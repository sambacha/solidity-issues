~Depends on #15053.~ Merged.

The current optimizer docs are pretty incomplete when it comes to documenting prerequisites and recommended steps to run before/after. I need up to date info to verify that the new sequence (#15030) satisfies these requirements so I went over the docs and the docstrings of the steps in the code, compared them and amended the docs where necessary.

I also compiled a table listing them, which is what I will actually refer to when analyzing the sequence - doing it by reading the docs is too unwieldy.

The main problem is: do you really want to guarantee that, assuming we satisfy these ordering requirements, arbitrary sequences don't lead to buggy cases :-)? We did miss one such case before and filed it as low severity bug, since custom sequences are rarely used and a "you-need-to-know-what-you-do" case reflected in lack of docs. If we document this in detail now, the situation changes - and we don't test any of this for correctness (and also can't - there's no way we can cover the space here with tests - we do fuzz this, but the fuzzer here can't catch everything...)

I'll in any case, still have a look and check if anything strikes me as odd since this affects https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15030.

We could also consider documenting this, but clearly stating that custom sequences are "at your own risk" anyways - even though that'd be a bit weird to start doing now out of the blue :-)... not sure yet :-).
