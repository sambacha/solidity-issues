## Abstract

I switch OFF to ON before compile solidity [coverage switch](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/cmake/EthCompilerSettings.cmake#L249).

When I used afl cov in conjunction with solc to test coverage, the following error occurred:

May I ask what the reason is?
Why does Solc not support coverage detection, or how can we detect Solc's coverage?

There is no **.gcno** file after compiling Solidity compiler with the coverage switch ON. And, there is no **.gcda** file after executing solc.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
