## Description

Why deploy the code failed. The error log is as following:

```
gas	1000000000000000000 gas
transaction cost	984375000000005328 gas 
execution cost	984374999999815072 gas 

revert
	The transaction has been reverted to the initial state.
Note: The called function should be payable if you send value and the value you send should be less than your current balance.
You may want to cautiously increase the gas limit if the transaction went out of gas.
```

why the gas cost so big?


```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.16;
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Uniswap {
    string[] public tokens = ["CoinA", "CoinB", "CoinC"];
    mapping(string => ERC20) public tokenInstanceMap;
    uint256 ethValue = 100000000000000;

    constructor() {
        for (uint i=0; i<tokens.length; i++) {
            CustomToken token = new CustomToken(tokens[i], tokens[i]);
            tokenInstanceMap[tokens[i]] = token;
        }
    }
}

contract CustomToken is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000 * 10 ** 18);
    }
}

```

I have the same problem, it look's like the constructor part take much gas.. but i don't find any solution at this moment.

Hey @anthhub!

The gas cost might be high because of the large bytecode which is due to the fact that the contract is using `new` to deploy another contract. Using `new` means that the compiler needs to include a copy of the contract to be deployed inside the one that is deploying it. This can easily make a contract blow up in size.

However, this is not a bug and hence, I will be closing the issue. I suggest that instead of opening issues for ad-hoc Solidity support questions like this, you consider checking out the [Ethereum StackExchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/ https://soliditylang.org/) for that purpose.
