## Abstract
Currently just using the `--optimize` option alone triggers optimization, even if the user does not request any outputs which would make the effect of optimization actually observable, like `--bin` or `--ir-optimized`. The compiler should not run the optimizer in such cases.

## Motivation
The output of `solc --optimize --ir` is identical to `solc --ir` and it could be just as fast, but instead it takes as much time as `solc --optimize --ir-optimized`.

The reason it matters is two-stage compilation, which is a mechanism we're soon going to be recommending as a way to parallelize compilation. Passing in the `--optimize` flag to the first stage is necessary to get correct metadata in cases where the optimization will only be performed by the second stage. For example, if the output of `solc --ir` is passed as input to `solc --strict-assembly --optimize --bin`, the metadata will say that the contract was not optimized. To get correct metadata the first command must be changed to `solc --optimize --ir` but currently this results in both stages performing the optimization, which doubles the compilation time and defeats the purpose.

## Steps to reproduce
This can be easily observed when compiling a contract like [`chains.sol`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/benchmarks/chains.sol), where optimization takes a lot of time:

```bash
time solc test/benchmarks/chains.sol --ir
```
```
real    0m0.272s
user    0m0.232s
sys     0m0.020s
```
```bash
time solc test/benchmarks/chains.sol --ir --optimize
```
```
real    0m22.785s
user    0m22.616s
sys     0m0.070s
```
```bash
time solc test/benchmarks/chains.sol --ir --optimize --ir-optimized
```
```
real    0m22.515s
user    0m22.346s
sys     0m0.043s
```

## Implementation notes
I think that `--ir` is actually the only output which exposes unoptimized artifacts (though we should check to make sure). If that's the case, internally it would be enough to extend [the mechanism triggering `enableIRGeneration()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.25/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L847-L852) to have separate flags for optimized and unoptimized IR.

Otherwise, we might consider splitting the "compilation successful" state into into distinct "codegen successful" and "optimization successful" states in [`CompilerStack::State`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.25/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.h#L102-L109).
