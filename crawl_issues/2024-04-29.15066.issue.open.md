## Description
I added code in [solProtoFuzzer.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/tools/ossfuzz) to output the Solidity program each time, but I found that each outputted program is the same.


## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): None
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```cpp
DEFINE_PROTO_FUZZER(Program const& _input)
{
	ProtoConverter converter;
	string sol_source = converter.protoToSolidity(_input);

	// ·········································································
        auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
        std::time_t now_c = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(now);
        std::tm localTime = *std::localtime(&now_c);
        std::ostringstream oss;
        oss << std::put_time(&localTime, "%Y%m%d-%H%M%S");

	std::hash<std::string> hasher;
	size_t hashValue = hasher(sol_source);
	std::string hashString = std::to_string(hashValue);
	
	std::string dump_path_string="/mnt/sdd1/solProtoFuzzer/"+hashString+"_"+oss.str()+".sol";
	ofstream of(dump_path_string.c_str());
	of.write(sol_source.data(), static_cast<streamsize>(sol_source.size()));
	// ············································································
```
However, I found that all the generated programs are the same, as follows.

```solidity

pragma solidity >=0.0;


contract C {
	function test() public returns (uint)
	{
		return 0;
	}
}
```

This is correct. At the time, the idea was to merge boiler plate code that would eventually expand to different generators for the  solidity language. But the latter is mostly code that has been unmerged unfortunately.
