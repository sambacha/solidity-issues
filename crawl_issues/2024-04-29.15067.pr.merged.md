# [\#15067 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15067) `merged`: Replace yarn by pnpm and drop perpetual-pools external test
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Apparently, `yarn` cannot anymore correctly resolve hardhat dependencies: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/33914/workflows/5a5a125e-4fdf-4758-8262-1138eeaa6549/jobs/1532619?invite=true#step-108-14857_47. Switching to `pnpm` seems to solve the issue.

This PR also removes the perpetual-pools external tests since it seems inactive for around two years now: https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/commit/48264d782859d59d04bcd3f7991576333c2c76f2 and our current fork would require a significant amount of work to update `hardhat` and other dependencies to work properly.

We should consider add other active projects to the external tests, now using our python test suite instead of the old bash scripts.
