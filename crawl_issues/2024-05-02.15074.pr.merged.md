# [\#15074 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15074) `merged`: Produce compiler error for compound division and mod zero operations

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1685266?v=4" width="50">[clonker](https://github.com/clonker) opened issue at [2024-05-02 14:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15074):

Fixes #14702 

As a side-effect, this will change the place in which an error for expressions of the form `a = a / 0` is raised:
- in terms of types, such expressions yield an `IntegerType` on the left-hand side, so no explicit value is associated with it as well
- pretending the lhs to be `0` lets me reuse some of the functionality but it also doesn't 100%ly capture the nature of the problem ("unary `f: x->x/0` is bad")
- without this change, an error for `a=a/0` will be raised in static analyzer. Static analyzer states in its docs, that it has to be possible to write equivalent code that does not generate the warning, so perhaps it was not the right place for raising it to begin with?
