> The changes look good to me now, we just need to squash the commits. I was also wondering if we could merge the changes proposed in this PR: #15339, or possibly even close it. I haven’t looked too closely at the tools being proposed - although the static analyzer seems nice - but since we're working on the same docs and there’s some overlap in the changes, this might be a good time to make a decision on that.

@r0qs Thanks for the review. I wanted to get to this today. Just caught up in some other issues. The idea is to consolidate the changes proposed in the external contribution, so I will ask for a final review once I've included those. :)

No problem. But yeah, that was just a suggestion though, because we have so many documentation PRs that have small changes, that maybe we could combine some of them. For example, this may also be relevant to add here or just close it: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15234

BTW, you could list all the other redundant PRs in your description and github will automatically close them when we merge this one. That would make it easier to keep track of them, because we have quite a few now.

To do this write something like `Closes #xyz`. Just note that it has to be in the description at the top (not in a random comment) and you have to repeat `Closes` for each one (so no shortcuts like `Closes #xyz, #abc, #def`).
