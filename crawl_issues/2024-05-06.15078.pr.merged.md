# [\#15078 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15078) `merged`: SMTChecker: Upgrade CVC4 to cvc5 and switch from API to SMT-LIB2 interface
**Labels**: `has dependencies`, `smt`

Instead of compiling `solc` itself with CVC4 support, it is now enough to have `cvc5` executable on PATH when running the compiler.
Instead of using API of CVC4, we now use SMT-LIB2 interface.
That means we write the queries to temporary SMT-LIB2 files and call the solver process directly to run on the file.

Depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15102

> Very minor comments + let's update the changelog and remove references to CVC4 in cmake/toolchain and config.yml.

Added an entry to changelog and removed the missed references to CVC4. Thanks!

> Why don't we merge into develop?

Not sure if this was already answered, but the reason is because this PR relies on `cvc5` being installed on the images used by  the CI. Thus it depends on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15102 being merged first.

Hmm, OK, yes, we should probably do that. Even though, it is probably an independent thing, if I understand it correctly, no?

Yes, it is independent. I just wanted to highlight it here. It will just be a matter of changing the settings and the documentation. I tested solc-js with your branch, and it works fine. We might want to add some tests to solc-js for this, although we currently don't have CI tests for Z3 there either.
