in preparation of type change of YulString s.t. these changes are more localized

What's this about? Is this regarding the Yul AST rework to get rid of the AST ID dependencies (or to at least strengthen them) in order then get rid of codegen non-determinism? Or is it something else?

The idea is to get rid of YulString as a kind of a leightweight string proxy in favor of a simple incremental uint64 index for handles (with a backing string vector of names) and do the string generation of derived names post-hoc

Alright, so killing the non-determinism in its root.

Depends on the level at which you're looking - but sure, restarting the optimization with an intermediate will kill determinism with that approach unless we do reordering after each step (which may not be so bad, let's see)

Hi @bshastry, as this changes some stuff in the fuzzing department as well, does the PR mess things up on your end or is it fine? :)

Sorry for the late reply :-(

Since the ossfuzz build passed, I would assume it is fine with the fuzzer as well. Dynamic breakages (at runtime) need to be seen though, let me know if you want me to run the fuzzer on this PR. That should throw up issues if any!

Cheers, no worries. I expect this PR to be closed anyways and there's going to be a new one with a different set of changes. That will also impact the fuzzer, most likely. I'll let you know :)

In #15215 I have done the following to address the points you brought up:
- qualified data names are reduced to `std::string`s (see, f.ex., [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15215/files#diff-85786c576d9ffa5957420e25761d465d531c5e9648f3a1d3f5cb91c40e201c5eR107))
- `"m"_yulstring` and `"s"_yulstring` [can be replaced](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15215/files#diff-811a5e03969efb73f76b3b56bc5d080b23ae7391b23125ad5d2bd7fa58d056e3R95-R96) by `0` and `1`
- There is a special empty `YulName` same as there is a special empty `YulString`

I am in the process of breaking down that way too big PR into smaller (or if not small, at least hopefully trivial) ones ~and we can see about each of the points in more detail then, so as far as I am concerned, we don't have to merge this~.

Thanks for the feedback! I think my editor was playing some tricks on me with the formatting:)
