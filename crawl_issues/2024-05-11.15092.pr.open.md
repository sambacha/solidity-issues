# [\#15092 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15092) `open`: Remove redundant prerequisite steps from the default optimizer sequence
**Labels**: `optimizer`

Since `gho` steps are hard-coded as prerequisites, there's not much point in having them in the default sequence. All other steps are supposed to preserve these properties.

For now this is just to verify that removing them does not really change generated bytecode in a meaningful way.

If this is true, we might consider merging it, though that would probably be better done only after rebasing it on the new sequence (#15030). Otherwise merging it would just revert it.

Rebased on top of the new sequence.

No, we don't really document the default sequence.

We need a changelog entry though.
