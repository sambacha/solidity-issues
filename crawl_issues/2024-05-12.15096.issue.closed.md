<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

Immutable variables replace their values at deployment with compile-time constants (as inlined bytecode). This necessarily means that any getter functions for `immutable` value types do not view contract state and so can be defined as `pure` instead of `view`, however the compiler does not allow this.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25 (and below)
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): cancun (and others)
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Remix
- Operating system: Windows 10

## Steps to Reproduce


```solidity

contract ImmutableGetter {
    uint256 private immutable _releaseDate;
    constructor() {
        _releaseDate = block.timestamp;
    }
    // pure throws with ("potentially reads from environment or state"). This is lazy
    function releaseDate() public view /* pure */ returns (uint256) {
        return _releaseDate;
    }
}

```

Heya @Ashraile and thanks for the issue. Now, just to be clear, we don't consider this to be a bug per-se, but the topic itself has been quite contentious and we still don't have a definitive decision on what to about the `pure` decorator. Some people are for the opposite of what you suggest - i.e. strengthening `pure` even further, but some are again the opposite of that. You can see some of the discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8153. There's some further reading in the following issues as well: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12829, https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9554. The reason we don't consider it a bug is because it's technically reading a state variable (which of course most would assume to mean reading from storage). I'll triage this and keep it open, since it's definitely something that could be improved upon, but as you can see from the multitude of similar issues, it's not easy to come to an agreement, so it will take some time.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
