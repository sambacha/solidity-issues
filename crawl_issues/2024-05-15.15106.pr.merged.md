Can be confirmed by running
``scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh dockertest``

I wonder if it was the same problem we've seen in 0.8.24 (#14816)? It did not happen in 0.8.25, so I assumed it was fixed.

I'm adding #14816 to the next milestone, because we really should have a CI check for this if it happened twice.
