**Labels**: `selected for development`, `low effort`, `low impact`

Introduce prague as EVM version (without yet implementing any features for it).
Can be modelled after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14705.

Primarily on the request of Ipsilon to ease reviving the EOF branch.

(in case anybody wonders: it's not an issue that it's not even clear what will actually be in Prague - this is just the version switch and Prague will anyways be backwards compatible - and there's precedent for adding EVM version options in advance - so we can just add this without further thought and then gradually build up features as they materialize, while Ipsilon can make use of it in their EOF branch)
