# [\#15112 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15112) `merged`: yul literal value as struct of u256 + optional formatting hint

Changed the definition of the `solidity::yul::Literal` to carry its value not  as `YulString` but as `LiteralValue` struct, consisting of a `u256` and an optional string representation hint. Upon converting from its data back to a string representation, it is first checked if the hint is not empty and in that case, whether `value == parseValue(hint)`.

the tests are now failing due to the change in expression hasher. what do you think @cameel, should I undo it? or rather update test expectations? Intuitively I would say undo, feels more natural to have a `true` instead of `1`. But either is fine for me

Well, it's definitely better to have `true` there, but why exactly does the `BlockHasher` affect that? Does the less specific hash result in some extra optimization kicking in that wasn't before? The change did seem correct so maybe the actual problem is outside of `BlockHasher`. If we locate that then maybe we could keep the change and still keep it at `true`?

In any case, it would still probably be best to have the same thing in both functions, since I don't see why we'd ever want them to behave differently. They should both hash `kind` or both hash `unlimited()`. Perhaps you could just pull the code it into a common local helper for hashing a `Literal` since they've been getting out of sync all the time in this PR? :)
