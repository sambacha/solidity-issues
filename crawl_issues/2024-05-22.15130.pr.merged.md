@nikola-matic Regarding why this only started failing when the PR was merged. I think it's actually because you created the PR before the github release was published and the script ignores missing releases: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.26/scripts/docs_version_pragma_check.sh#L183-L189
