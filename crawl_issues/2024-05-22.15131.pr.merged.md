**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

- Defines a contract with a name that exceeds 32 characters
- programSize is defined as datasize(contractName)
- if not correct, programSize can be substituted by optimizations into ctor return value
- this is due to u256 words only capturing first 32 chars

> If the build passes (sans `ext_benchmarks` of course), feel free to merge. Or can you actually merge by yourself?
