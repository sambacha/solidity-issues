The `c_ext_benchmarks` job in CI is supposed to calculate a diff between its current one and the one on the base branch and [attach the result as an artifact](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.26/.circleci/config.yml#L1584-L1585). This does not happen for some reason. If you look at any of the recent runs on pull requests (e.g. [`c_ext_benchmarks` artifacts in job e34192](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/34192/workflows/838fdcd6-7a30-427c-9639-f3b2551fd9c0/jobs/1547402/artifacts)) you'll notice that it properly obtains the files to be diffed, but does not actually create the diff.

This actually broke quite a while ago, but never seemed important enough to spend time fixing. The fix is probably trivial though. I'm submitting an issue so that I don't have to explain it again every time. Also maybe we'll finally fix it during this bugfixing sprint :)
