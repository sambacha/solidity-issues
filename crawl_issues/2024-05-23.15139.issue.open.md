## Abstract

Currently exceptions such as `UnimplementedFeatureError`, `CodeGenerationError`, `StackTooDeepError` and `CompilerError` are reported as internal compiler errors, i.e. by completely interrupting what the compiler is doing and printing out diagnostic information that's meant to help with tracking down a bug in the compiler. This behavior is appropriate for development assertions, which generally won't fail unless there is a bug, but not for errors that users will normally encounter when compiling their code.

## Motivation

The current behavior is very confusing to users as evidenced by the discussion thread in #12783.

There have been some limited attempts at improving this, for example we do [catch `UnimplementedFeatureError` if it carries a source location](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.26/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp#L764-L786). Unfortunately this is not nearly enough. The `solUnimplementedAssert()` macro for raising such errors does not even allow attaching a location, so it is uncommon to have one, even when it is easy to obtain. E.g. in #14913 the obvious thing to do would be to point at the problematic `require()` call. Instead the user gets diagnostic info pointing at a location in the *compiler's* source, which is useless in that context. In other cases, like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15001#discussion_r1603214954, this limitation leads to dropping otherwise useful tests.

## Specification

There are several things we should do to address this situation:
- `UnimplementedFeatureError`, `CodeGenerationError`, `StackTooDeepError` and `CompilerError` should be caught and reported as proper compilation errors even if they do not have a location.
- The errors should include location where possible:
    - `solUnimplemented()` should allow including location.
    - `solUnimplementedAssert()` should be removed to avoid suggesting that it's an assertion like `solAssert()`. It's actually a validation.
        - Its message parameter should have been mandatory. A message for the user should always be provided with such errors.
    - Add locations to the current uses of `UnimplementedFeatureError` where available. There aren't that many of them and it will greatly improve user experience.
    - For cases where location is not known we could try iterating on [Daniel's attempt](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/compare/develop...legacyUnimplementedSourceLocation) at obtaining the location automatically.
- Review existing handlers for these exceptions. After doing the above most of them should not be necessary. All these errors inherit from `util::Exception` and if not caught where we expect them, they should generally be treated as any other unexpected exception by the top-level handler.

## Backwards Compatibility

I don't think there are any backwards-compatibility concerns associated with this change. Currently these exceptions produce diagnostic output that is platform-dependent and we don't guarantee its stability in any way.

When `StackTooDeepError` is caught and handled gracefully, add the following test to `libsolidity/semanticTests/errors/`:

```solidity
error E(
    uint, uint, uint, uint,
    uint, uint, uint, uint,
    uint, uint, uint, uint,
    uint, uint, uint, uint
);

contract C {
    function f() public {
        require(false, E(
            0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0,
            0, 0, 0, 0
        ));
    }
}

// ----
// f() ->
```
in order to catch said error introduced in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15174.
