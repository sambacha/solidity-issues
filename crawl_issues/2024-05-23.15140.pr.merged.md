One mistake I made this release (which was very costly time-wise), was that I merged the version bump (on develop) and the changelog skeleton *before* tagging. Fortunately, I realized in time, but then reverting the change took ~45 minutes of CI run time, and then another ~45 on top for the same run on develop (after merging the revert). I wanted to add a note to the release notes, but technically, it does only mention this step in the post release notes, so I ultimately did not add it.

ok, time to merge this.

@nikola-matic You can still mention that in [Learning from Past Releases](https://notes.ethereum.org/@solidity/release-mistakes). I mean, I already did, but just saying that it's a good place to mention things that went wrong despite the checklist not being at fault here.
