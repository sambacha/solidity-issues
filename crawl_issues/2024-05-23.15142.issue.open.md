# [\#15142 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15142) `open`: Unsafe type conversions with the IR codegen
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31586236?u=c9570edf68871d3ef3094da164e6f23117d36587&v=4" width="50">[hedgar2017](https://github.com/hedgar2017) opened issue at [2024-05-23 20:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15142):

## Description

With legacy codegen, when `uint40` is returned from a function, the value is truncated. In the code below, if a value larger than `uint40` is passed to `getNumber`, it is truncated to 40 bits. This means that the results of `getNumber(0)` and `getNumber(2**40)` are the same.

With `viaIR` codegen, the value is not truncated and some garbage remains in memory. Thus, the actual index accessed in the `numbers` array is not correct, so executing `getNumber(2**40)` results in an 'Array index out of bound' panic error.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): default
- Operating system: MacOS 14 Sonoma

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract Foo {
    uint256[] internal numbers;

    function addNumber(uint256 number) public {
        numbers.push(number);
    }

    function getNumber(uint256 index) public view returns (uint256) {
        return numbers[_convertToUint40(index)];
    }

    function _convertToUint40(uint256 n) internal pure returns (uint40 result) {
        assembly {
            result := n
        }
    }
}
```

Glad someone brought this up too. I identified similar issues. On Mac processors, the recasting is assigning uint40(38) to uint256(2**40). This does seem like a coedGenerator bug to me.
