Just noticed that you do have this but it's in the commit message. I'd recommend against it since this adds a lot of noise to the issue you mention this way - the commit appears there again and again each time you rebase the branch. It works much better when used in the PR instead.

> * The PR is missing a changelog entry.
> * When a PR fixes everything in the original issue you should use the github feature that will fix the issue automatically when the PR is merged. I.e. just add `Fixes #11496` in the PR description.
> * I saw that the issue was moved to the 'In progress' column on the triage board. That column actually means that triage is progress :) It was added so that multiple people don't waste time triaging the same issue at the same time. The issues are only really meant to spent a short time there - triage never really takes all that long.

Ahh I have misunderstood the "in progress" :) thanks for pointing that out!
