Attempt to fix `c_ext_benchmarks` job when downloading artifacts from CircleCI API: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/34295/workflows/0cf0489b-11bd-4eae-8a23-6951de527304/jobs/1552691

The problem is only with CircleCI API that apparently started to require authenticated requests. Maybe this changed recently in the v2 API, I honestly don't know. I couldn't find any information about it.

Also, note that CircleCI v2 API does not support project API tokens and, currently, recommends the use of personal API tokens (see: https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#section/Authentication).

Furthermore, the way it is currently done in this PR, reads a personal token from the environment variable that is set in the project settings to build the http header, this method has some risks of exposing the token, but we already do similar thing in our CI: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml#L146

Isn't this in general the way things are done - i.e. store token in an ENV variable, and then read and use from a script? I.e. I don't know how much better we can make this, or what the alternative approaches are?

Yes, I think so. When used in the CI I don't see alternatives to manage those secrets other than what we already do (https://circleci.com/docs/security-recommendations/). But I wanted to point it out just in case ;)

Just to let it documented, as stated by CircleCI docs, they do not expose those variables unless the project is explicitly set to share it with forks, which we don't.

```txt
Environment variables set in the CircleCI application are hidden from the public,
these variables will not be shared in forked PRs unless explicitly enabled.
```
Source: https://circleci.com/docs/oss/#security

This means that PRs from external contributors will still fail after this is merged if they not add to their CircleCI's fork config a environment variable named `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` with their CircleCI's personal token.

As discussed on the chat, let's add a check in `c_ext_benchmarks` definition to skip the script if the token is not available. Then it won't be failing for external contributors.
