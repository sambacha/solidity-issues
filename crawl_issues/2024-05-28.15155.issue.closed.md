<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).
- If you feel uncertain about your feature request, perhaps it's better to open a language design or feedback forum thread via the issue selector, or by going to the forum directly.

## Abstract

Currently, memory is allocated always when someone is declaring a struct. Following is an example when someone might not want this behaviour.

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

```solidity
struct MyStruct {
  uint256 a;
}

function run() {
  // fmp: 0x80
  bytes memory data;
  // fmp: 0x80, data: 0x60
  data = abi.encode(1); // allocates 2 words on memory i.e. len and actual data word
  // fmp: 0xC0, data: 0x80
  MyStruct memory v;
  // fmp: 0xE0, data: 0x80, v: 0xC0
  assembly { v := add(data, 0x20) }
  // fmp: 0xE0, data: 0x80, v: 0xA0
}
```

## Motivation

In some cases, the dev knows that a certain memory slice will be always immutable (probably because the original variable will be dropped). However, the struct declaration advances free memory pointer on declaration. If there would be a way to prevent that, it would be great.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

```solidity
MyStruct memory v = null;
assembly { v := add(data, 0x20) }
```

A keyword `null` can be introduced in Solidity, which would make the struct variable point to `0x00` memory location. 

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->

None to my knowledge.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
