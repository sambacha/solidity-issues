@clonker I think that the confusing thing is actually that the "optimized IR" output does not necessarily contain optimized IR :) It depends on the optimizer settings. It's just the main IR output that's used for compilation via IR and needing it for bytecode generation is natural, regardless of the optimization level. This is tripping people up all the time, especially on the CLI (@aarlt recently complained about that :)).

But I do think that things could be clearer. I wasn't fully satisfied with the initial version. I tried something new now - I replaced `IRGenerationGoal` with `IROutputSelection`, which should make it more apparent that it's really about outputs and not whether the optimizer runs or not. Let me know if you find that better.

Rebased to resolve a conflict with #15228.

I also tweaked it a little more for readability:
- Renamed `enableIRGeneration()` to `requestIROutputs()` and adjusted its docstring. The new name should not suggest that it is the only way to enable IR generation.
- Introduced intermediate booleans and some comments for the condition in `CompilerStack::compile()`. Hopefully it makes it even easier to see at a glance what's happening there since the nitty-gritty details are encapsulated and when looking at a condition the name already tells you all you need to know.
- There were a few places with leftover `goal` naming (it's now called `selection`).
