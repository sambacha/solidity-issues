## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b849b327781cb71478709b28c4d0d372492cbdc1/libsolidity/codegen/ContractCompiler.cpp#L141-L146
The call value check will generate the following opcodes: 
```
CALLVALUE DUP1 ISZERO PUSH2 0x10 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST POP
```
The original value of the first DUP1 is not used; it is not accessed in the revert branch and popped in the other branch. Therefore, the DUP1 operation is redundant. I think we can directly use the original value. The optimized opcodes could be:
```
CALLVALUE ISZERO PUSH2 0x10 JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT JUMPDEST
```


## Optimization
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b849b327781cb71478709b28c4d0d372492cbdc1/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerContext.cpp#L357-L370
In this case, the function ```revertReasonIfDebug``` returns "revert(0,0)". For this special case, could we simply return the optimized opcodes to eliminate the redundant dup1 and pop?

Or is it possible to optimize this dup1 and remove the pop in function appendConditionalRevert?
