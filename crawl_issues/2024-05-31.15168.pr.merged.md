# [\#15168 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15168) `merged`: Catch `unimplementedFeatureError`s and report them as errors

First attempt on partially closing #15139.
This is focusing on making #15001 pass our CI tests and hopefully will serve as a base for future tasks of the issue mentioned before.

Two more things:
- You should wrap `YulStack::optimize()` in a handler too.
- This needs a changelog entry. It's either a bugfix or a minor compiler feature: unimplemented features are now properly reported as errors instead of being handled as if they were bugs.

> > You should wrap YulStack::optimize() in a handler too.

> It was already wrapped... or are you referring to `YulStack::optimize(Object& _object, bool _isCreation)` ? This latter one is private and only called by  `YulStack::optimize()`.

Ah, you're right! I completely forgot that we decided to do this in the top-level `optimize()` because this one is recursive.
