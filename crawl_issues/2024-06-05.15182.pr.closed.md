The quick and easy solution for #15179, which only reuses the IR.

Benchmarks on external projects:

| Project              | v0.8.26   | This PR  | Speedup |
|----------------------|----------:|---------:|--------:|
| openzeppelin         |    40 s   |     36 s | 10%     |
| uniswap-v4           |   177 s   |    116 s | 34%     | 

Script that I used for benchmarking: #15183.

Here's some more benchmarking with #15183:

| Project              | legacy | IR (0.8.26) | IR (this PR) | Speedup   |
|----------------------|-------:|------------:|-------------:|----------:|
| openzeppelin         |   10 s |        41 s |         36 s |       12% |
| uniswap-v4           |   22 s |       259 s |        140 s |       46% |
| eigenlayer           |   80 s |      1324 s |        622 s |       53% |
| sablier-v2           |  153 s |      1952 s |        889 s |       54% |

Some important notes:
- This time the numbers are averages from several runs. The small difference for OZ is actually reproducible and not just a fluke.
- The previous results for Uniswap were on a commit from 2024-05-10. I updated to 2024-06-06 before this benchmark and apparently it now compiles *a lot* slower even with a release binary. I think they must have added more tests. Still, this seems to make the effect of the PR even more pronounced.
- Sablier fails with StackTooDeep when compiled via IR. I still included it because this seems to happen towards the end compilation and the result seems in line with the other projects in the table, all of which did complete without errors.

And here is the timing from external tests (extracted using the script from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15023#issuecomment-2067151960):

| Project          |   Before |   After |   Diff |
|:-----------------|---------:|--------:|-------:|
| brink            |      4 s |     4 s |    0 s |
| colony           |    100 s |    99 s |   -1 s |
| elementfi        |     98 s |    82 s |  -16 s |
| ens              |     26 s |    35 s |    9 s |
| euler            |     30 s |    32 s |    2 s |
| gnosis           |          |         |        |
| gp2              |     38 s |    30 s |   -8 s |
| pool-together    |     35 s |    33 s |   -2 s |
| uniswap          |     47 s |    37 s |  -10 s |
| yield_liquidator |     22 s |    22 s |    0 s |
| zeppelin         |    177 s |   149 s |  -28 s |

They numbers don't seem particularly reliable though. For example the longer running time for `ens` is unexpected and I suspect it's just the CI variance, but then most of the other results don't tell us anything either because they're in a similar range.

Also, I'm not sure how OpenZeppelin in CI takes ~150 s to compile. The main difference is that it's being compiled with Hardhat rather than Foundry, but such a difference still seems odd. Is it downloading something rather than just building? Is the CI machine that slow?

I'm closing this since we won't be merging it. The actual fix is based on caching optimized IR instead.
