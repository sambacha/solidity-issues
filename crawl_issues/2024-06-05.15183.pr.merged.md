# [\#15183 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15183) `merged`: Performance benchmarks using external projects with Foundry
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-06-05 14:57](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15183):

This is an adaptation of the [current benchmarking script](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/benchmarks/run.sh) to do the kind of benchmarking that I did in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14854#issuecomment-2070222067. So far I've been doing that semi-manually, but it's more convenient to have that properly scripted.

**TODO**: There are a few more projects that I'd like to add:
- [x] Seaport
- [x] Eigenlayer
- [x] ~AAVE~ (not using Foundry)
- [x] Sablier
