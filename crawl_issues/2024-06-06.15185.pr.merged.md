# [\#15185 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15185) `merged`: Replace unnecessary validations with assertions
**Labels**: `refactor`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-06-06 20:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15185):

`CompilerStack` has a lot of checks for things that are never meant to happen and do not need a user-facing validation. We normally enforce such expectations with assertions, because violating them is a bug, not a compilation error.

This has been bothering me for a long time, but became especially annoying now when I was reviewing #15168 and needed to figure out what kinds of runtime exceptions we throw and when.

I also fixed two somewhat related things:
- Several cases of `InternalCompilerError` being thrown directly rather than as a result of a failed assert.
- Several cases of unexpected `FatalError` being rethrown rather than immediately handled as a violated assumption. Now it's an ICE and the assert makes it clear that it's unexpected, not requiring extra comments.
