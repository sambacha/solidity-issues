- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Environment
version: 0.8.25
setting: --optimize-runs: 20000

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
```
contract Demo {
    struct A {
        uint b;
        bool c;
        address d;
    }

    A sa;

    constructor(A memory p) {
        sa = p;
    }

    function covert() public returns(uint) {
        A memory ma = sa;
        return ma.b;
    }
}
```
The above code can generate the following opcodes:
```
PUSH1 0x0 SWAP1 SLOAD SWAP1 PUSH2 0x100 EXP SWAP1 DIV PUSH1 0xFF AND ISZERO ISZERO ISZERO ISZERO DUP2 MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 ADD PUSH1 0x1 DUP3 ADD PUSH1 0x1 SWAP1 SLOAD SWAP1 PUSH2 0x100 EXP SWAP1 DIV PUSH20 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND PUSH20 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND PUSH20 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND DUP2 MSTORE POP POP
```
There are four consecutive ```ISZERO``` operations. The last two are redundant because they do not change the result. 
Similarly, there are three consecutive ```PUSH20 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND``` operations. The last two are also redundant because they do not change the result.

Two ```ISZERO``` are generated at line 1194 in the function ```convertType```, while the other two are generated at line 233 in the function ```storeInMemoryDynamic```.

One ```PUSH20 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND``` is generated at line 279 in the function ```retrieveValue```, another at line 1194 in the function ```convertType```, and the last one at line 233 in the function ```storeInMemoryDynamic```.

Is it possible to remove the two redundant ```ISZERO``` and the two redundant ```PUSH AND```?
