**Batch Assignment of Voting Rights**:
 - **Function**: ``giveRightToVote(address[] memory voterAddresses)``
 - **Description**: Assigns voting rights to multiple addresses in a single transaction.
 - **Logic**:
   - Checks if the caller is the chairperson.
   - Iterates through the list of addresses.
   - Assigns voting rights to each address if they haven't already voted and don't already have the right to vote.

Hi @superXdev, the reason the example is 'deficient' is precisely because of the subsequent `Possible improvements` section, which allows the readers to explore further and implement such improvements themselves. Therefore, fixing it would make the whole thing somewhat redundant. I'll be closing this PR for that reason.
