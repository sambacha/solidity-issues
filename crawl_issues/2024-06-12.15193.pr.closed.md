Made some small tweaks to the pointers in the Sorts.h and Sorts.cpp files to use raw pointers to reduce overhead. Would take some work elsewhere to fully implement, but this can be used as a starting point.

Hi @ToTheMax24. This isn't really as much of an improvement as you think it is - whilst using shared pointers here *is* an overhead, it is comparatively a tiny one, and one that wouldn't really make any perceptible difference in the performance of the compiler, especially seeing as this is only used in the SMT checker component. For that reason I'll be closing this PR (especially since the builds are failing, indicating that this would require more work on your part).
