We also need to update the build scripts, like [build.sh](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/build.sh). But I'm wondering why not just add the `git submodule update --init` in the [CI build script](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ci/build.sh) and consequently all CI steps that build the code would already setup the submodules in the beginning of the build process.

Actually, maybe even better, I think we could do all in cmake using [execute_process](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/execute_process.html), something like:
```cmake
find_package(Git)
if(Git_FOUND)
    execute_process(COMMAND git submodule update --init ...)
    ... 
endif()
 ```
 And also add the error message as suggested by @clonker if the submodules are not initialized correctly.

At least scripts/release_ppa.sh will also need adjustment - although we can do that separately, we'll have to confirm that that works with a prerelease PPA build - but we shouldn't forget in any case. Might be worthwhile to check if any other release build mechanisms also need adjustments, resp. to confirm that they work (like docker builds and such)

I think this was a really good idea! It simplified this PR a lot, we don't need to initialize the submodules explicitly anymore.

Ok, I just tested the resulting source archive with homebrew:
The build of the old version failed as expected:

```

The new source archive seem to work as expected (no warning regarding `FetchContent`) However, I'm not able to build it on my machine - it looks like that `boost` does not contain `arm64` for some reason. Not sure why.

However, I guess we could just ignore that. Building manually from source is working without any problems.

Ok, I found the problem: I had two conflicting boost versions installed. After removing the "old" version, everything works as expected:

Oh, one more thing. Once we merge this, it would be good to have a follow-up PR with an update to latest versions of these libraries. Especially range-v3 seems to be already at 11.x, while we're still on 9.x.
