The last time we updated Z3 was 4.12.1 over a year ago (#14074/#14076). 4.13.0 has been released in April, it's about time to update.

This is not critical since it mostly affects tests (they are all guaranteed to pass only on the single version we use in CI), but it's best if we stay on top of the latest version. New versions may need some changes on our side, which could be the reason behind issues like #15196.

There are definitely some regressions in our test suite with Z3 4.13.0, so we cannot update right away.
I have filed an [issue](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/7255) in Z3. Let's see if can get to the bottom of this.

Looks like the issue in Z3 is now solved, but we have to wait for the next release.
