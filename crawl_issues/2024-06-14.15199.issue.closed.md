> @cameel Maybe an interesting side note. The resulting installation shrunk from 14.92 MiB to 14.33 MiB when switching from ld.gold to ld. Installation via https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/solidity. Considering the installation contains much documentation which was not affected by a change of the linker, the binaries must be the reason for all the size difference.

Done in #15474.

@Spixmaster: 0.8.28 will no longer support `USE_LD_GOLD` and will use the default linker instead.
