Hey @0xdochev! We appreciate you taking the time to open an issue. However, it is difficult to understand what the issue is without specific details about appropriate description and links. Additionally, we are currently not seeking reports for trivial typo/grammar/language fixes in the docs or Solidity org website.

I will be closing this on these grounds.
