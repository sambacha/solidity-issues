We used `UniqueErrorLogger` for reporting proved targets, which requires pair `(error code, source location)` to be unique. I replaced that with a regular `ErrorLogger`.

What would happen if we remove `m_uniqueErrorReporter` from `ModelChecker` and just use the `ErrorReporter` passed from `CompilerStack` (so we do not have to add another `ErrorReporter`)? Where would we run into problem with duplicates?

I'll double check that, but I almost sure I've seen CHC reporting some failed targets twice.

That's interesting. I would expect the same behaviour for safe and unsafe targets.

The unique reporter was added in #11850 (which was meant to address #11597). See the description:

> The SMTChecker generates a lot of redundant "unsupported" warnings, because it visits every contract separately in its own context, with 2 different engines. So for example if a contract that is inherited by 2 contracts has some assembly in it, we're going to see the message "inline assembly unsupported" possibly 6 times: each time a contract is visited, by each engine.

@pgebal, I checked and you were right that in certain situations, we would emit a warning multiple times for the same source code location without `UniqueErrorReporter`. For example, assertion violation in a parent contract in the presence of inheritance.

There is a possibility to maybe be more efficient in these scenarios. For example, if the assertion can be violated in the context of one contract, we do not need to check it again in the context of another contract.
But then one must consider also the case where the assertion is safe in the context of one contract, but can be violated in the context of another contract.

Let's go with your fix now, and we can maybe revisit this later. Can you just remove the unnecessary field in `SMTEncoder`?
Or maybe you can do it the other way around? Only have it in `SMTEncoder` and not add again in `BMC` and `CHC`?

Actually, we have it only in the SMTEncoder. Sorry for misleading comment I posted earlier.
I think the PR is ready for a merge
