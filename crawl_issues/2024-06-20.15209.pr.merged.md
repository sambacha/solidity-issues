Also, just to confirm/point to, I see that we have some tests in `test/libyul/Parser.cpp` which seems to cover parsing. Not sure if we need or would benefit from adding something more there.

I guess you could now also remove the `rm ./*_bytecode_too_large_*.sol ./*_combined_too_large_*.sol` in `.circleci/parallel_bytecode_report.sh` - if I remember correctly, the crashes where mainly happening because of the regexp stuff.

Looks like it worked. Which is actually odd, because this PR doesn't fix #13496, does it? I mean, if it does then great, maybe we should close it too, but it's also possible that it got somehow fixed on `develop` and we didn't realize :)

It does segfault for me in the issue you linked above on develop and not on this branch when, e.g., invoking `solc --via-ir --asm test.sol`. I assume it is because of the debug comments:

Invoking the same with `--debug-info none` does not segfault on develop, either.

yep exactly! its because of the debug comments. I ran into this when I was working on [the debug attribute parsing stuff](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/14857). I would say we should merge this soon so I can rework my PR.

In general it is a bug in `std::regexp` in some GCC versions that created that segfault.

Ah, right. I focused on parsing the long hex string (which should not be affected by this PR) but overlooked the fact that such a string will also end up in a snippet as a part of debug info. In that case, yeah, this PR does fix it.

Just to leave it here: the segmentation fault was related to a bug in GCC's `std::regex` implementation. This bug is at least reproducible with GCC 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 & 14.
