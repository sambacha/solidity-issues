The `require(cond, message);` syntax is nice and lets you think clearly about the restrictions you're enforcing because the condition is a positive (it's easier to think 'when this condition is true, do X', versus 'when this condition isn't true, do X').

```solidity
require( n <= MAX_NFTS_PER_COLLECTION, "ec.TOOMANY" );
```

And custom errors are nice, because it lets you include additional contextual information along-side an error. However to raise custom errors you must invert the condition which can be slightly more annoying to think about.

```solidity
if(n > MAX_NFTS_PER_COLLECTION) revert ExtendedTooMany(collectionId)
```

I suggest that the second parameter of `require` be adjusted to either pass a message string or an expression which returns an Error type:

```solidity
require( n <= MAX_NFTS_PER_COLLECTION, ExtendedTooMany(collectionId) );
```

Hi @CedarMist, this feature is already supported in Solidity [v0.8.26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.26) in `via-ir` codegen pipeline (you can read more about it in our [release blog post](https://soliditylang.org/blog/2024/05/21/solidity-0.8.26-release-announcement/)). And it was recently added to legacy codegen in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15174, but it is not released yet, it will be available for legacy codegen in the next release.

My bad, I tried to search before submitting.

Glad to hear this will be in the upcoming release
