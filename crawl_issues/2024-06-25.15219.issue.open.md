        array.push(1);

Hey @haoyang9804! Thanks for reporting this bug.

As mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13566, solc --gas has not been actively maintained and we plan to remove it in the next breaking version as the estimator isn't heavily used in practice.

As per our knowledge, there are no major tools that depend on it. So we would love to know if you have a specific use-case for it or any other dependency that the team should consider before deprecating it.

Thanks for your kind reply. Honestly, I don't have a designated scenario where this flag is necessary. I encountered this error while experimenting with the compiler for smart contract compilation, and I mistakenly regarded it as an error.
