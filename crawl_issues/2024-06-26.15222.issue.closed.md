## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
When I write a no-effect statement such as 1 + 2, Solidity compiler warns me that it has no effect. But when I substitute 1 with x, no warning is issued. Does "x + 2" have any side effect, such as changing the value of x or increase the memory cost?
## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.27-develop.2024.6.25+commit.ce4be6e1.Darwin.appleclang
- Operating system: Macos M2 Sonoma 14.5

Hey @haoyang9804!

This behaviour is not a bug, but rather intentional. It can also be deemed as a duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13840. The compiler currently does issue a warning only for pure statements. We've briefly outlined the possibilities of extending this behaviour to accommodate cases like yours in [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13840#issuecomment-1428759194) and shall keep the original issue open as a catch-all for similar issues.

Hence, I will be closing this one as a duplicate.
