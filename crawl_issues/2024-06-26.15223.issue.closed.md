<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

A segmentation fault caused by a possible syntax error.

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.8.27-develop.2024.6.25+commit.ce4be6e1.Darwin.appleclang
- Operating system: MacOS Sonama 14.5

## Steps to Reproduce

```Solidity
pragma experimental solidity;

class Self: Class1 {}
class Self: Class2 {}

forall (A: (Class1,,Class2), B: Class1)
function f(a: A: Class1, b: B: Class1) {}

forall A: Class1
function g(a: A) {}
```
Using `solc` CLI to compile the above code results in a segmentation fault.
`forall (A: (Class1,,Class2), B: Class1)` contains 2 commas between `Class1` and `Class2`, which is a syntax error (maybe).

Hi @haoyang9804 thanks for opening the issue, but as you can read here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15177#issuecomment-2158185230 there is not guarantee of stability in the `experimental` pragma, and at the current stage of development we will not be fixing all possible segmentation faults that happen there.

This issue was used to create a [Solidity compiler bug bounty](https://www.reddit.com/r/solidity/comments/1fczopw/bug_buster_to_upgrade_its_solidity_compiler/) that looks for new segfault errors on v0.8.27.

Hi @claudioantonio, maybe you mentioned this issue by mistake. Note that this segfault occurs under the `experimental` pragma and thus it is not relevant to find bugs under such experimental features, since they are not considered stable and not widely tested anyway.

Yes, @r0qs ! What I meant to say was that we got inspired by this issue and implemented a validation for only accepting proposals of segfault errors if they do not use the `experimental` pragma. ðŸ˜‰ Thanks for the heads up!
