**Labels**: `refactor`

The first part of refactor for #15179.

Introduces `ObjectSource` object that can store partial IR output (without the sources of dependent contracts). Then makes `IRGenerator` output it. Finally `CompilerStack` puts it together into a complete IR source file.

### Status
Works but still needs some tweaks.

It compiles and gives the same results as the original codegen, but I want to do some final changes to the structure and also fill in small things that I skipped on the first pass (constructors, docstrings, etc.). The remaining stuff is marked with `TMP` notes.

The next step will be passing `ObjectSource` directly to `YulStack` and making it handle incomplete `Object`s. This will make the compiler reuse optimized IR

Closing in favor of #15229.
