# [\#15225 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15225) `merged`: SMTChecker: Simplify CHC predicate representation
**Labels**: `smt`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-06-26 19:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15225):

As a preparation for a larger refactoring of SMTLib interface, we can simplify our representation of the CHC predicates.
There is no need to represent the predicates with symbolic variables. These are not variables that correspond to expressions in the code. It is sufficient to store the name of the predicate and its signature (sort), which we can do with the SMT Expression.

As a consequence, I also needed to change the code related to sorting of predicates (needed for computation of counterexamples).
After the proposed change, some predicates (currently only predicates related to array slices) do not have any number in their names anymore. For this reason it was necessary to change the code extracting number from predicate name, which previously relied on this assumption.

Because the predicates now get declared later than before, the code changes caused some changes in Z3 behaviour, hence the updates to our tests.
