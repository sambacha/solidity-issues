This is a work in progress; each commit is to introduce a new rule in `.clang-format`, with said rule applied to both `TypeChecker.cpp` and `TypeChecker.h` for easier review. Suggestions are welcome.

`chk_coding_style` step should also be adapted to run `clang-format` on the pushed commit locally (in the context of the CI), and then compare changes on the remote, and error out if there's a difference. This is of course to be done once `clang-format` is applied to the entire codebase.
