# [\#15228 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15228) `merged`: Fix wrong native locations in optimized IR AST

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-07-01 04:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15228):

Looks like ``nativeSrc`` in the Yul AST always matches the unoptimized source, even when the AST represents the structure of the optimized one. It's not surprising since keeping locations updated through optimizations would be pretty inconvenient for very little value, but still, I don't think users are expecting this behavior and I'd consider it a bug. I guess one could argue that the unoptimized location is the truly "native" one, but I don't think this was ever intended and does not seem very useful, since those locations are already available in the unoptimized AST.

The fix is to reparse the source again before generating the optimized AST.

Yul parsing is pretty fast so I did not bother optimizing this, but if we wanted to we could switch to not storing the IR AST and generating it on demand instead. It would save some memory too and I think that this feature is rarely used so no point in doing it eagerly.
