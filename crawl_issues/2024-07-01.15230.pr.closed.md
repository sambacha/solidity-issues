# [\#15230 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15230) `closed`: Optimization without dependencies in `CompilerStack`
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `optimizer`, `has dependencies`

Fixes #15179.
Depends on #15229.
Replaces/closes #15182.
Includes commits from #15228.

This PR builds on the refactor from #15229, making `CompilerStack` actually take advantage of the new structure. `IRGeneratorOutput` can now be parsed into a partial Yul `Object` that does not contain dependencies and can also be optimized in this form.

What we have here should already be good enough for #15179, but it we wanted to, we could go one step further and extend it to reusing EVM assemblies, avoiding repeating the Yul->EVM transform.

### Status
Mostly done in terms of functionality. Needs resolving a few final snags, some cleanup and testing.

- [ ] Need a less hacky way to bypass dependency checks in Yul analysis.
- [ ] Change in MSize detection inconsistency (can't detect it in dependencies at optimization time but can at assembling time).
- [ ] Should I generate IR source only on demand and work primarily with the partial `Object`s, without serializing and reparsing them?
- [ ] More testing.

Just like in case of #15182, closing because we won't be merging it. The actual fix is based on caching optimized IR instead.
