## Abstract

We get a very generic error response from the compile which just says, "Gas Estimation Error", for any kind of errors in the code. We should consider adding support for more specific errors by the EVM. Just a thought, happy if this is not worth taking a look.

## Motivation

I think everyone would understand this.

## Backwards Compatibility

We can put this into the new version, like, 0.8.28.

Yes!! definetely useful , But if we more adding more support it will become more complicated and there is a feature of Ai which we can use more efficiently.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
