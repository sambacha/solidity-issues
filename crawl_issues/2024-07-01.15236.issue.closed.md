<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description
The unary "+" in "((x) /= (2 % x)) + (-y)" reports an error, but x = ((x) /= (2 % x)) + (-y) does not.
<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.27-develop.2024.6.25+commit.ce4be6e1.Darwin.appleclang

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {
  function f(int32 x) external pure returns (int32) {
    int32 y = 1;
    ((x) /= (2 % x)) + (-y);
    return 2;
  }
}
```
Compiling the above program raises an error complaining that `+` is disallowed in `((x) /= (2 % x)) + (-y);`. However, when I change this expression statement into `x = ((x) /= (2 % x)) + (-y);`, the compiler does not raise the error.
According to my understanding of Solidity type system, `expr /= expr` is an assignment expression, and its value equals the value of the left-hand-side identifier. I think `+` can connect the assignment expression and an identifier expression `(-y)`.

Thanks for reporting, this is definitely an unintended regression introduced in 0.8.20!

Probably a duplicate of #14624.
