**Labels**: `smt`

We introduce a representation of a context for `CHCSmtLibInterface`. The role of the context is to keep track of the information we pass to the solver in the SMT-LIB2 script, which is needed in order to properly parse back the solver's response (i.e., invariants and counterexamples).
This information includes mainly our custom datatypes, sorts, predicates and variables.

Previously, most of the information was already stored, but scattered between `SMTLib2Interface` and `CHCSmtLib2Interface`.

Beside the introduction of the `SMTLib2Context` class, this PR introduces the following notable changes:
- We define separate solver interfaces for `BMC` and `CHC` as the solver interfaces for these two engines are quite different. The minimal common functionality stays in the common `SolverInterface`.
- We introduce a helper abstraction over the string representations of SMT-LIB commands in the class `SMTLib2Commands`.

These changes are a preparation for using Z3 via SMT-LIB interface.
How that is going to work can be seen in #15252.

I had to update a bit more than what was in the suggestions (the usage of the parameters in the body), but I think I got them all :)

Yeah, I didn't explicit mark them, but I was supposing you'd change them too :)
