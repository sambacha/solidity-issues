I rebased this thinking about merging it, but reading the whole thing again, mentioning that `Solidity is a statically typed laguage...` after it already saying that `Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language...` several lines above is superfluous to me, and I therefore find the current phrasing to be better, which is why I'll be closing this PR.
