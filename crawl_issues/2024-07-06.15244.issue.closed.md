## Abstract

<!--Please describe in detail what is wrong.-->

"Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features."

This sentence is awkward, due to its chaining of adjectives, verbs, and nouns  (statically typed (adj), supports inheritance (compound verb), libraries and complex types (nouns)).  

Here's a better way of writing it:

"Solidity is **a** statically typed language **that** supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, among other features."
