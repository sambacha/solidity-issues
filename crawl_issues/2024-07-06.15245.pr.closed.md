This pull request addresses the `UnimplementedFeatureError` encountered when using a custom error with the `require` statement in Solidity. The issue arises because custom errors are only available using the via-IR pipeline. To resolve this, we refactor the code to use an `if` statement with a `revert` for the custom error.

### Changes Made:

- Refactored the `require` statement to use an `if` statement with `revert`.

### Before:

```solidity
require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], InsufficientBalance(amount, balances[msg.sender]));
```

### After:

```solidity
if (amount > balances[msg.sender]) {
    revert InsufficientBalance(amount, balances[msg.sender]);
}
```

Please review the changes and let me know if there are any questions or further adjustments needed.

Hi @tal7aouy, I'll be closing this since it's a bit of a moot point, since `require(bool, Error())` will be available in the default pipeline in the [next release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md?plain=1#L5) anyway.

I did however notice that I actually missed this exact page when updating the docs for said feature - so if you're up for it, feel free to open another PR when you would need to bump the [version pragma](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/introduction-to-smart-contracts.rst?plain=1#L88) to `0.8.27`, and to get rid of [this comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/introduction-to-smart-contracts.rst?plain=1#L90).
