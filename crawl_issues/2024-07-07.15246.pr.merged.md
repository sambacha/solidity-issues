Right now the compiler prints the variable names and the stack representation, but it is not very helpful when you run into this error in a big codebase. This PR tries to tag the available source location as additional information to the exception.

Before:
```
$ ~/.svm/0.8.25/solc-0.8.25 src/test.sol --bin  --via-ir
Uncaught exception:
/solidity/libyul/backends/evm/EVMObjectCompiler.cpp(106): Throw in function run
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::StackTooDeepError>
std::exception::what: Cannot swap Slot RET with Variable value1: too deep in the stack by 1 slots in [ RET headStart value14 value13 value12 value11 value10 value9 value8 value7 value6 value5 value4 value3 value2 value15 value0 value1 ]
memoryguard was present.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Cannot swap Slot RET with Variable value1: too deep in the stack by 1 slots in [ RET headStart value14 value13 value12 value11 value10 value9 value8 value7 value6 value5 value4 value3 value2 value15 value0 value1 ]
memoryguard was present.
```

After:
```
$ ~/dev/ethereum/solidity/build/solc/solc src/test.sol --bin --via-ir
Uncaught exception:
/solidity/libyul/backends/evm/EVMObjectCompiler.cpp(106): Throw in function run
