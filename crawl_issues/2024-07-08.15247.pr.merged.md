No I haven't. I wrote a test case in `solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp` but the output contains the path to a temporary file which changes everytime and I am not sure how to handle it. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15247/commits/6b6407c57c7f5e61b253eea47507602216c9cc6e.

I meant something like this - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/cmdlineTests/ir_subobject_order

Duh, yeah, I forgot we can do that :grin: 
Added.

We have this [section](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/internals/layout_in_storage.html#layout-of-state-variables-in-storage) in the docs describing the storage layout and it mentions `storage` very frequently. I was thinking of a good way to include the information about transient storage. I think that a note explaining that **regarding** the layout of state variables, and only that, the same rules apply for both storage and transient storage.
Is that a good approach?

I generally agree in that we don't have to create a separate section and just repeat everything verbatim, but I think we could use a tiny bit more mentions than just a single note :) See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15247#discussion_r1700636368

Gonna need to squash the commits - still got some fixups in there.
