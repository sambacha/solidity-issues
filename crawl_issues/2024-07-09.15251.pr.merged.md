# [\#15251 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15251) `merged`: SMTChecker: Increase Z3 resource limit

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-07-09 14:50](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15251):

Increasing resource limit of z3 results in more SMTChecker tests correctly solved, without increasing the running time significantly.

This is in preparation for switching z3 to SMT-LIB interface, so as to not have significant changes in tests for that switch.
