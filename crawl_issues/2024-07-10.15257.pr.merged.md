Test for:

Function types.

```
contract C {
  function() internal transient x;
}
contract C {
  function() public transient x;
}
```

Reconfirm that naming conflicts are already covered by syntax tests, e.g.
```
contract C {
uint transient public x;
uint public x;
}
```

Disallow initialization of transient state variables. => some syntax analysis => some tests

I restricted the initialization of transient storage state variables. I guess that should go in a separate PR.
Regarding the template class, I tried to contain it to `LValue.h`, but there are a lot of forward declared classes there which are used by the implementation. I then created `GenericStorageItem.cpp` but not sure if there's a better more organized way of doing the same.

Test case:
```
contract C {
    uint256 y;
    uint256 transient x;
    function f() public returns(uint256 r) {
        assembly {
            r := x.slot
        }

    }
}
```
Should return 0

Plus more tests with various combinations of state variables in storage and transient storage, also for smaller than 32 bytes type (e.g. ``uint8``) with not only ``.slot`` but also ``.offset``

Some tests about cleanup:
````
contract C {
    uint8 transient x;
    function f() public returns(uint256 r) {
        uint8 y;
        assembly { y := 0xFFFF }
        x = y;
        assembly {
            r := tload(x.slot)
        }

    }
}
````


````
contract C {
    uint8 transient x;
    function f() public returns(uint256 r) {
        assembly {
            tstore(x.slot, 0xFFFF)
        }
       return x;

    }
}
````

Some trivial test for getters of public state variables
```
contract C {
   uint transient public x;
   function g() external returns (uint) {
       x = 42;
       return this.x();
   }
}
////
x() -> 0
g() -> 42
```

some more involved test that uses a multi-call-frame setup using the public getter from another call frame.

One more thing, that I already mentioned on the call - we're missing docs for the `transient` modifier.

Also, I noticed that `TSTORE` and `TLOAD` are missing from `GasMeter::estimateMax()`, which means that functions accessing transient storage will get infinite estimate and e.g. won't be inlined. Which is out of scope of this PR - we're not adding optimizer support here - but perhaps it's something we may want to address soon because fixing it looks really simple.

I suggest we do that in a separate PR. I am already working on that and checking the docs.
