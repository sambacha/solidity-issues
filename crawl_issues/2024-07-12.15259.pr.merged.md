# [\#15259 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15259) `merged`: Explicit treatment of printing mode in Yul AsmPrinter

When the YulNameRepository is merged, the AsmPrinter will need to have an instance of it anyways (which contains the dialect), so I changed the AsmPrinter s.t. the printing mode is explicitly specified instead of implicitly inferred from whether a dialect pointer is null or not.
