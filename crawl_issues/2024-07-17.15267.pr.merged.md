Fixes #15179.
Replaces #15182, #15230.
Depends on #15309.

This is yet another attempt at reusing optimized IR. Simpler than the previous ones.

~I still need to iron out a few minor things and clean it up so it's still a draft, but at this point it's mostly done.~ Done.

I'd give this one a changelog entry by the way. One could argue that it doesn't need one, since the change should be purely transparent - but I'd have two reasons for still giving it an entry:
1. it changes how the optimizer is invoked and the caching *in principle* could be buggy in some way, so having a log entry makes it easier to trace down any change in behavior we may have missed due to this (even though this is not likely)
2. while the change is technically transparent, it should in fact be noticeable in performance, so doesn't hurt to point towards it.

Yeah, definitely. I was going to do that anyway, just still fighting with a different issue (getting different source locations for pure Yul compilation - may have to disable caching for that).

I'm marking it as ready to review, since the implementation is done, but I'm not very happy with test coverage, so I'll probably add some more tests tomorrow.

A big problem is that it's hard to create a test that checks that things are really being cached. I actually broke it at some point and only realized when I reran benchmarks, which we don't do in CI.

> Regarding testing I think unit tests would be actually good in this case to ensure that the cache functions as intended.

Unfortunately proper unit testing is not easy here either. At least not without adding otherwise unused functionality to inspect the workings of the cache and storing extra data in it. Otherwise too little information is exposed. E.g. we don't really know what is included in what key or which objects in a hierarchy were restored from cache.

In the end I settled on adding a new type of a test case. It only really tests the usage via `CompilerStack`, from Solidity rather than Yul and only counts how many objects where cached. It does not exhaustively test the cache functionality with different settings, but we'll at least notice if bytecode dependencies stop being cached. In the end that's the most relevant use case.

I also added some more `objectCompiler` tests, especially to cover differences in debug data. I actually found a bug in the PR that way - `AsmPrinter` does not print the `@use-src` comment so debug data was incomplete and objects with identical code but different debug data were being unified. Now that's fixed.

This is not perfect coverage, but given how simple the cache is, it's probably good enough.

Can be merged after another rebase.
