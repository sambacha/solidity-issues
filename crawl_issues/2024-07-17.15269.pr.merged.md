# [\#15269 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15269) `merged`: Fix isoltest crash when formatting call arguments in a contract whose ABI includes unnamed functions
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Bug in isoltest discovered by @rodiazet.

`functionSignatureFromABI()` would attempt to calculate signature for a function even if it had no name in the ABI (which is the case for constructors, fallback and receive). This would lead to a crash.

The buggy logic is used only for formatting expectations when a test fails in interactive mode so it went undiscovered until now.

It's not even possible to cover it with a test. It can be easily reproduced, but we would not add such a test since the expectations do not match:

```solidity
contract C {
    constructor() {}
    function f() external pure returns (bytes32) {}
}
// ----
// constructor()
// f() -> 42
```
