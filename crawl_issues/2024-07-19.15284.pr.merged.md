This is essentially a revert for today's temp fix in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15275. The underlying issue was fixed in node `v22.5.1` (https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v22.5.1), however, it make take some time for the packages to propagate, so `node:current` may still point to the buggy `22.5.0` release.
