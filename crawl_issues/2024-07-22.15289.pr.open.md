**Labels**: `ethdebug`, `:yellow_circle:`

- if `debug-info` was set to `ethdebug` 
  - it will only work if also `ir`, `irOptimized` and/or `ethdebug` was selected as output.
`standard_debug_info_in_yul_ethdebug_output_ir_optimized`, `standard_debug_info_in_yul_ethdebug_output_no_ir`
  - it will always work with `strict-assembly` e.g. `solc --strict-assembly <yul> --debug-info ethdebug`
  - `debug-info` `ethdebug` is excluded from the help on cli
  - `debug-info` `ethdebug` is excluded from `all` on cli and wildcard selection `*` in standard-json
- if `ethdebug` was selected as output 
  - if no `debug-info` was selected, it implicitly set `debug-info` to `ethdebug`. `solc <contract> --ethdebug`
  - if `via-ir` was not specified, it will error with a message stating that `ethdebug` can only be selected as output, if `via-ir` was defined. `solc <contract> --ethdebug` only works with `--via-ir`
  - if `debug-info` was selected and did not contain `ethdebug`, an error will be generated stating that `ethdebug` need to be set in `debug-info` `solc <contract> --ethdebug --debug-info location`
  - `strict-assembly` will always work e.g. `solc --strict-assembly <yul> --ethdebug`
  - output selection `ethdebug` is not shown in cli help
  - `ethdebug` output selection is excluded from wildcard selection `*`  in standard-json
  
**UPDATE**
After some discussion with @gnidan and @ekpyron it turned out that we need something slightly different:
- we need to be able to distinguish ethdebug debug data from deploy-time and run-time.
- standard-json:  `ethdebug` output will now be enabled with `evm.bytecode.ethdebug`(deploytime part) and `evm.deployedBytecode.ethdebug` (runtime part)
  - special case: output selection of `evm.bytecode`and `evm.deployedBytecode`behave like a wildcard, so the ethdebug stuff is excluded here.
- cli: like binary selection `--bin` and `--bin-runtime` ethdebug selection will now work similar with `--ethdebug` and `--ethdebug-runtime`
