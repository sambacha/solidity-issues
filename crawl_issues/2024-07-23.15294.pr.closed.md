[EOF Mega Spec](https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/blob/main/spec/eof.md)

- [EIP-7480 ](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7480)(Only `DATALOADN`)
- [EIP-4200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4200) (w/o RJUMPV)
- [EIP-4750](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4750)
- [EIP-6206](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6206)
- [EIP-7620](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7620)
- [EIP-7069](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7069)
- [EIP-5450](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5450)
- evmc update to 12
- Change `sendMessage` interface
- Add `compileToEOF` flag in semantic tests settings
- Semantic tests updated

TODO: 
- There is a couple TODOs added in the commits. They need to be implemented in separated PR.
- ~~Immutables bug reported by Paradigm needs to be fixed.~~ FIXED
- Semantic tests may stop passing because part of them depend on exact contract code which may change with compiler development. Additional support for contract addresses needs to be implemented in `soltest`.
- CI integration may be required.
