Hey @Ocheretovich! We appreciate you taking the time to suggest the changes. However, we are currently not looking for trivial fixes in the language/grammar in the readme. That being said, Solidity docs are open for contributions and we are constantly looking for feedback to improve them. Feel free to let us know if something needs improvements or fixes there. :)
