## Description

When deploying a contract with no functions, just a constructor that uses inline assembly to store multiple values using mstore with no stack variables, a "CompilerError: Stack too deep" error occurs. This error is observed when compiling with Solidity versions less than or equal to 0.8.25, enabling optimizations, and setting runs to 1. The issue disappears when upgrading to the latest Solidity compiler version (0.8.26) or when optimizations are disabled. The error also arises when the number of mstore operations in the assembly block exceeds 576.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.25
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Cancun 
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix 
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Revm
- Operating system: Mac OS

## Steps to Reproduce


Copy and paste the below solidity code snippet into the remix IDE, enable optimizations, setting the runs value to 1. If you remove at least one of the mload ops, putting the number of mload ops to 576, then the bug goes away.
