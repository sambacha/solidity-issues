## Abstract
Encoding process of bytes and string is confusing(wrong). In the first example function `bar(bytes3[2] memory)`, two arguments are passed `["abc", "def"]` which are getting encoded to their ASCII equivalent and get right padded. This suggests, function signature should look like `bar(string[2] memory)` as mentioned in [Formal Specification of the Encoding for string](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#formal-specification-of-the-encoding) except for the length part.

>- string:
>
>    enc(X) = enc(enc_utf8(X)), i.e. X is UTF-8 encoded and this value is interpreted as of bytes type and encoded further. Note that the length used in this subsequent encoding is the number of bytes of the UTF-8 encoded string, not its number of characters.

Otherwise, if the function signature is `bar(bytes3[2] memory)` then directly bytes should be passed into functions which would be `616263` and `646566`. After encoding these would become `0x6162630000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` and `0x6465660000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

Similar issue with third example too for `dave`.

It is simply wrong, string values are passed as bytes in those examples. I had raised this issue on [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/8536) too, if they are lacking functionality and probably lacking specifications compliance. But this is just problematic technically, mixing string and bytes will create inconsistent encoding values. For example, if a function receives `abc` as input, it can be already hex encoded bytes value, and it can be a valid string also. This creates confusion whether it is already encoded value and needs to be padded only or encoding still needs to be done on the given value.
