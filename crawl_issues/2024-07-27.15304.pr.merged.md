Currently, the ["SMTChecker and Formal Verification" documentation page says](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/smtchecker.html#proved-targets):

> # Proved Targets
> If there are any proved targets, the SMTChecker issues one warning per engine stating how many targets were proved. If the user wishes to see all the specific proved targets, the CLI option `--model-checker-show-proved` and the JSON option `settings.modelChecker.showProved = true` can be used.

However, the correct CLI flag is `--model-checker-show-proved-safe` and the correct JSON key is `showProvedSafe`.

This PR updates the documentation to reflect the correct flag and JSON key.

Interestingly, [the commit that introduced this mistake](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/21c0f7865055c0e276c94332bbb5e1e46d639f84) used the correct flag/key in the changelog but not the docs for some reason.

After having a discussion with the team, we decided to revert the wording in the docs that you've added (namely adding safe to proved), as it sounds a bit off. The rest is good, and was a genuine bug in the docs, so thank you for taking the time to fix it.
