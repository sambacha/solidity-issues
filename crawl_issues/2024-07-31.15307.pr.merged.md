# [\#15307 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15307) `merged`: SMTChecker: Use pipe instead of temporary file in solver interface

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-07-31 14:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15307):

Since version 2.1 (released in March 2024) Eldarica supports reading input from standard input. We can therefore update SMTSolverCommand to interact with the solver using pipe instead of creating temporary file on which the solver runs.

cvc5 also supports this, and does not require any extra flags to enable this feature.
