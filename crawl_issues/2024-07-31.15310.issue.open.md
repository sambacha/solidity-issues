I'm creating this issue to keep a list of tasks that will need to be done after https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15294 is merged before we can consider EOF support "non-experimental".
The list is non-exhaustive so far and not ordered by importance, please just edit in additional tasks (or comment) for anything still missing.

General/Miscellaneous
---------------------------------
- [ ] Proper workarounds for cases of "out of reach" rjumps
       (e.g. using intermittent jumps, outlining or splitting out control flow using `JUMPF`)
- [ ] Refactor parts of ``Assembly::assemble`` to better split into EOF/non-EOF parts (see e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15294#discussion_r1699070143 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15294#discussion_r1699186514)

Language Level Changes
------------------------------------
- [ ] Properly reject non-salted creation during Analysis (when targetting EOF)
- [ ] Ensure proper analysis treatment of various high-level constructs with EOF, including:
  - [ ]  ``type(C).creationCode`` and similar (disallow)
  - [ ] low level calls (disallow; reintroduce for EOF-low-level-calls - consider either another unified version that works for both targets or implementing the EOF-style version for legacy as well, if at all possible)
- [ ] Builtin address calculation for salted creation (compatible with both EOF and legacy)
- [ ] In-language construct to check for EOF (like a global bool ``isEOF``)? Option to define both legacy and EOF specific assembly blocks? (Ideally we're fine without this, but will need to check demand from library authors)
- [ ] Allow deploying custom subcontainers (like https://gist.github.com/frangio/940f21778f411154dc58ff818c712929)
- [ ] Related to the above: consider if we need to disallow ``verbatim`` for targetting EOF (since we cannot perform stack height analysis) and can/need to replace with full custom subcontainers. To retain `verbatim`, it'd need to declare it's max stack effects, if used with EOF.

Noteworthy Documentation Entries
----------------------------------------------------
- [ ] Compile a list of breaking changes, similar to what we did for [IR codegen](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/ir-breaking-changes.html).
    - [ ] Difference in address calculation in salted creation and
    - [ ] Constructor arguments no longer affecting salted-create address.
    - [ ] ``EXTCODESIZE`` check.
- [ ] Document the EOF-Yul builtins.
- [ ] Document the EOF opcodes.
- [ ] Check for required documentation changes on all changing output artifacts.
- [ ] Check general introductions for legacy/EOF specific parts.

Compiler Output (and Input) Artifacts
-----------------------------------------------------

- [ ] Settle the details on CBOR metadata. (Where? -> Likely beginning of data; Should we tweak the format?) See https://github.com/ethereum/sourcify/issues/1523
  - [ ] May involve documenting that e.g. ``--no-cbor-metadata`` induces code changes (in particular dataload offsets) - similar prerelease vs release due to the length of the cbor-encoded version string.
- [ ] Generate proper source mappings.
- [ ] Properly define and output assembly text and assembly json for EOF.
- [ ] After the above allow importing EOF assembly json.
- [ ] (Minor) print `JUMPDEST` as `NOP` for EOF assembly/opcode.
- [ ] Make sure the "immutable references" output remains accurate - and whether it can/should be reused for information within the data section or we should have a new artifact for that instead.


Optimizations
--------------------
- [ ] Use ``RJUMPV`` for dense Yul switches; investigate trying to turn sparse switches into dense switches (especially for the external dispatch)
- [ ] ``CALLF RETF`` -> ``JUMPF`` peephole optimizer rule; tail-call optimization in codegen
- [ ] Consider potentially new peephole optimizer rules (e.g. certain chains of swaps to exchange)
- [ ] Adjust Yul inlining heuristics
- [ ] Allow stack depth larger than 16 with ``SWAPN``/``DUPN`` during Yul->EVM code transform and remove all stack-to-memory logic
- [ ] Exploit ``EXCHANGE`` for stack shuffling
- [ ] Consider creating a version of the libevmasm low-level inliner that can inline EOF function calls according. (Very low-priority - most can be expected to be done on the Yul level - would be more relevant if we backported EOF to legacy codegen)
- [ ] Relax ``RETURNDATACOPY`` restrictions in the optimizer.
- [ ] Exploit ``RETURNDATALOAD``

Testing
-----------
Note: Obviously any changes in all other points need proper testing. But beyond that generally:
- [ ] Set up fuzzing pipelines for EOF vs legacy (needs robustness against minor differences in e.g. salted creation addresses)
- [ ] Try to unify tests (e.g. if not already done, refactor tests that depend on address calculations (e.g. move into a testing contract)); try to reduce test copies between legacy and EOF in general, whenever possible.

Breaking Changes
--------------------------
**Note:** Non-backwards-compatible changes we should do *even with legacy as target* in the breaking release that switches to EOF per default. (EOF-specific breaking changes for EOF as target can generally be done outside of breaking releases if restricted to only affect compilation when EOF is enabled)
- [ ] Consider renaming the previous special ``datacopy``, etc., Yul builtins for legacy codegen.

New Language Features
-----------------------------------
**Note:** we don't need these to call EOF support stable, but notably a few language features become significantly easier to support with EOF, e.g.:
- [ ] Reference-type Immutables (resp. a data location for the data section)
- [ ] returndata as data location
