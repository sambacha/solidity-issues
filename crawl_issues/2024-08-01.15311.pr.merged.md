# [\#15311 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15311) `merged`: SMTChecker: Do not prematurely end reading the solver's response

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-08-01 07:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15311):

When the main process reads an answer from the solver, it can happen
that the solver process has already finished, while the main process is
not yet done with reading the output from the pipe. In rare occasions,
the caused some test to fail, because SMTChecker could not produced the
expected counterexample from partial answer.

As part of this PR, I am adding a small cleanup, mainly adding comments to explain the parameters passed to the solvers.
