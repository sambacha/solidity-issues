## Abstract

It's common (e.g., on Mac) to have a white terminal background.
solc's errors then disappear
I originally reported this in #14378 and it got mentioned again in #14580 , but AFAIK this is still happening.
Maybe swap the error color for the color you're using for the ^^^^^ 
Not 100% sure whether the output I'm looking at is generated by forge or solc, but last time around the foundry folks blamed solc.

## Motivation

Using a common background color as a foreground color for error text means the error text is invisible, but other (arguably less important) elements of the output are visible.
