## Abstract

type().max min should work with user defined types that are mapped to scalar types

type MY_THING is uint32;
MY_THING constant MY_THIN_FLAG=type(uint32).max;

is what's currently required because I can't write type(MY_THING).max. 

## Motivation

This is really unfortunate, as it destroys one of the main utilities of such a type alias. Now if I decide I want more bits for MY_THING I have to change the underlying type in multiple places = much larger probability of introducing a bug.

## Specification

Allow type(user_defined_type) when user_defined_type maps to a scalar underlying type.

## Backwards Compatibility

none

Thanks for the idea. There is something to it, but maybe using a different approach.

We don't think that `type(MY_THIN_FLAG).max` makes sense as equivalent to `type(uint32).max`, because the maximum (and minimum) is specific to the UDVT, not its representation. `uint32` is just an implementation detail of the type and its maximum value may not even logically be a valid value of that UDVT. Having `max` accessible this way could be undesirable and misleading for some UDVTs.

Defining a constant actually seems like the right solution to your problem. This way you can define an arbitrary maximum/miniumum adequate for the type and you don't have to change it in multiple places. Though note that you need `wrap()` to properly define it:
```solidity
MY_THING constant MY_THING_MAX = MY_THING.wrap(type(uint32).max);
```

What we'd be open to instead is letting the user refer to the underlying type in a generic way, e.g. with something like `type(MY_THING).underlyingType` or `type(MY_THING).representationType`. Then you'd be able to do this:

```solidity
MY_THING.wrap(type(type(MY_THING).underlyingType).max);
```
Though TBH that's long enough that I'd want to hide it behind a constant anyway :)

In any case, this is very low priority until we have the new system with generics, where such a type could have more uses. Especially given that a constant seems like a pretty adequate workaround.
