Heya @rodiazet, we finally managed to bump the docker images to evmone12, but unfortunately, not all of them, since the ossfuzz images is causing problems - we therefore decided to leave said images as is (with evmone11), and to bump the rest of them.

You can now bump the hashes in the `.circleci/config.yml` to the ones produces in my PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15321. Scroll all the way to the bottom, and update the ones with a :+1: emoji; also note that I've added an Ubuntu 24.04 images, so you'll have to add a separate entry for that one.

Ping if you need help :)
