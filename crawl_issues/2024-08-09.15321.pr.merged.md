> LGTM. But will we run tests using the `ubuntu2404` image in the CI? If so, we need another PR adding it to the CircleCi config.

I'd prefer to do that in another PR so as not to trigger yet another buildpack-deps build. By the way, if I merge this now, I assume a new buildpack-deps build will be triggered on develop (do we stop these manually, or just let them run)?

If I'm not mistaken, the action is only triggered on PRs targeting the `develop` branch, so merging will not run it.
