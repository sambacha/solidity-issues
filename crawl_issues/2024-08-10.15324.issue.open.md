## Abstract

For type safety reasons, such as when using uint256 et al as a slot, or as an index into a specific storage array (pseudo pointer), it is often desirable to declare a type such as:

type SpecificArrayIndex is uint64;

With additional work, this avoids errors where a variable storing the index of one array is accidentally used to index, or do arithmetic on the index of, a different array.  The additional work is to either (a) declare internal function accessors to the arrays that take typed index parameters, or (b) use the [editorial: super cumbersom] wrap/unwrap calls in arithmetic.

I propose:

type SpecificArrayIndex is uint64 with_operators;

## Motivation

Enhance type safety. Readable code.

SpecificArrayIndex MAX = SpecificArrayIndex.wrap(type(uint64).max);
SpecificArrayIndex HIGH_BIT_FLAG = SpecificArrayIndex.wrap(SpecificArrayIndex.unwrap(MAX)&(SpecificArrayIndex.unwrap(MAX)>>1));

becomes (when combined with my other feature request to allow type() to accept simple value types, perhaps only those with_operators):

SpecificArrayIndex MAX = type(SpecificArrayIndex).max;
SpecificArrayIndex HIGH_BIT_FLAG = MAX & (MAX>>1);

or, if you also support type(SpecificArrayIndex).numBits:
SpecificArrayIndex HIGH_BIT_FLAG =SpecificArrayIndex.wrap(1<<(type(SpecificArrayIndex.numBits)-1));


## Specification

add with_operators to grammar. user defined value types that carry this flag get all of the standard arithmetic and comparison operators.

## Backwards Compatibility

New code won't compile under old compilers. Old compilers won't understand new code. All good.

Should this be stale? Just calling attention to this feature.
