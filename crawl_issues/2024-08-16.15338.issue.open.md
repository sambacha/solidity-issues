During the evmone (v11 -> v12) bump in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15321, we encountered a multitude of problems with the ossfuzz image; it would seem like the base image (maintained by Google) had it's LLVM toolchain (including clang) updated from clang15 to 18, which meant that we had to bump boost as well. But that then caused other failures during solidity test/compilation phase.

Seeing as Ipsilon is currently working on an EOF implementation, of which the first PR is soon to be merged, we're going to need the ossfuzz image to support evmone12 as soon as possible.
