Updated Docs:

- Added the deprecated tag to Brownie, as it is not maintained anymore.
- Added Cyfrin Updraft to general resources as it is a great way to learn Solidity Development.
- Added Aderyn to Solidity tools because is a nice Static analyzer tool for Solity.

@cameel should we make a new PR for this? Or is it not wanted.

It was closed along with a few others that became redundant after #15076. So that's a question to @mehtavishwa30.

Hey @PatrickAlphaC! Apologies for the missing clarification earlier. We had several external PRs to update the resources page that were accommodated in #15076.

From @cromewar's PR, 
- I added a note to address the deprecation of Brownie as suggested
- Also added in Aderyn (great suggestion!)
- I left out Updraft because IMO, it doesn't fit under our general resources section, as all resources focused on education continue to live on the [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/) developer portal instead.

I hope this is helpful! Lmk if you have thoughts. :)
