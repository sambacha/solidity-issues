[Blind Auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)
<!--Please link directly to the page which you think has a problem.-->

## Abstract

While reviewing the Blind Auction section, I noticed an issue related to the withdraw function.  The `bid`, `reveal`, and `auctionEnd`functions all correctly use the `onlyBefore` or `onlyAfter` qualifiers to enforce their execution within the appropriate time intervals.  However, the `withdraw` function lacks such restrictions, which may introduce a potential bug.

## Issue

During the reveal phase, the winning user reveals his highest valid bid and then calls the `withdraw` function to withdraw his highest valid bid (which is also the global highest bid). This will result in not enough coins being paid to the beneficiary when the `auctionEnd` is done.

As I understand it,the withdraw function should only be available for bidders to call after the auctionEnd function has been executed. Incorrect ordering of withdraw calls can lead to issues. However, I did not observe a restriction on this behavior in the code, so it may pose risks after deployment.

```solidity
…
/// Withdraw a bid that was overbid.
    function withdraw() external {
        uint amount = pendingReturns[msg.sender];
        if (amount > 0) {
            // It is important to set this to zero because the recipient
            // can call this function again as part of the receiving call
            // before `transfer` returns (see the remark above about
            // conditions -> effects -> interaction).
            pendingReturns[msg.sender] = 0;

            payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
        }
    }

/// End the auction and send the highest bid
    /// to the beneficiary.
    function auctionEnd()
        external
        onlyAfter(revealEnd)
    {
        if (ended) revert AuctionEndAlreadyCalled();
        emit AuctionEnded(highestBidder, highestBid);
        ended = true;
        beneficiary.transfer(highestBid);
    }
…
```
Of course, it could also be my misunderstanding of the blind shooting process, if so, I think maybe adding the description of the blind auction process may prevent more people from having the same problem.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
