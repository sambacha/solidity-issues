Not sure how they were removed just like that in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/13355, but it's been annoying me ever since :-).

Probably because it's not clear at all that these are CLion build dirs and that they are still relevant. `cmake-build-*/` does not exactly suggest that. You should really put a comment in there saying what it is because if I were to clean it myself I'd make that mistake too.
