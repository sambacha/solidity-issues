This needs a rebase and should probably be made reviewable now that the base branch has been merged.

BTW, please remember to include links to related PRs. I wanted to take a quick look at the base PR to remind myself what we did there, but realized that there's nothing connecting them so I'd have to go looking for it...

True. I wanted to clean it up a little bit more and bring the commit history in order (along with the rebase), didn't get around to it yet, though. Once that is done I will mark it as reviewable. I have added a link to the PR description.

One more thing. Not sure if it's worth it at this point, since it's extra effort for you, but after going through most of the PR it seems to me that there is a way to split it into two smaller parts quite cleanly, and smaller PRs would get through review faster. I think that the introduction of `BuiltinHandle` and all the changes in the `Dialect` would make sense on their own. Then introducing `FunctionName` it into the AST could be a second step on top of that.

I'll do as you suggested and split the PR into two. It is more work for me but probably downstream more efficient, all things considered.

Comparing against current develop (including `BuiltinHandle`s):

|         File (IR)    |   Time develop     |   Time PR          | Change    |

Can you rebase on latest `develop`?
