This commit introduces the interface class without actually using it. The actual switch will be done later, after all things are set up.
This was separated from #15252.

Seeing as this is an unused interface, I expect you're going to be making some tweaks in subsequent PR regardless, so please take a glance at the comments, and then we can merge.

@nikola-matic, I think I addressed all your comments, except the `solAssert -> smtAssert`. I believe I have that prepared somewhere down the pipeline. If you are OK with it, I would address this one later.
