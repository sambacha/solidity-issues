Now that https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15195 was merged we require to recursively clone Solidity repository in solc-bin when running the github actions for nightly builds as well as bytecode compare jobs. See: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/actions/runs/10481074451/job/29029908615#step:7:496

This seems to be trivially fixed by adding `submodules: 'recursive'` option to the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) in the CI.

See successful test here: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/actions/runs/10487749944/job/29048779836

We may also need to update solc-js: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L429

After a quick look, I believe we don't need to update it there, since the clone there is only used to run solc-js external test script and not to build solidity.
