## Abstract

Lots of source files contain ```SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0``` while stating in a human-readable license header that 

```
        solidity is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.
```

A correct SPDX license tag for these files has to be [GPL-3.0-or-later](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0-or-later.html).

## Pull request

I don't think I am in a position to propose PR with changes solely related to a project's licensing terms. Perhaps active Solidity developers should handle it instead.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
