Problem is in https://github.com/ipsilon/solidity/blob/eof-prep-1/test/libsolidity/Metadata.cpp#L228 test. It doesn't make sense for now. Even changing first evm version to `prague()` does not help because the codegen produce a code with `PushTag` which is not allowed for eof and is asserts in https://github.com/ipsilon/solidity/blob/eof-prep-1/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L965.

The test should be added later and adjusted to new EOF version. I can move it to proper commit (later PR) of the `eof-cleaned` branch. Let me know your opinion.

Makes sense, yeah - we need clean CI to merge this, but we can just remove the test for now, merge this PR and bring the test back later, yes!
