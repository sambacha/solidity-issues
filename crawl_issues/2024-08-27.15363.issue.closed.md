## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.26
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): None
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None 
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
{
    let index := 0
    for { } lt(index, 5) { index := add(index, 1) }
    {
        let y := mul(index, 2)
        mstore(mul(0x20, index), y)
    }
    let r:=mload(0x40)
    mstore(0x80, r)
    sstore(1, mload(0x80))
}
```
### Get bin
#### normal
```
solc-0826  --strict-assembly --bin test.yul
5f5b60058110601657604051608052608051600155005b80600260019202816020025201600156
```
#### optimize
```
solc-0826  --strict-assembly --bin test.yul
5f5b60058110601057604051600155005b80600191821b8160051b5201600156
```
### Run in EVM
#### normal
```
go-ethereum/build/bin/evm --debug --json --code 5f5b60058110601657604051608052608051600155005b80600260019202816020025201600156 run
```
#### optimize
```
go-ethereum/build/bin/evm --debug --json --code 5f5b60058110601057604051600155005b80600191821b8160051b5201600156 run
```
### Execution result analysis
#### normal
```
output,storage,memory
{'output': '', 'gasUsed': '0x57ea'},{'1': '4'},{'0': '0', '32': '2', '64': '4', '96': '6', '128': '4'}
```
#### optimize
```
output,storage,memory
{'output': '', 'gasUsed': '0x57ca'},{'1': '4'},{'128': '8', '0': '0', '32': '2', '64': '4', '96': '6'}
```
The value in memory at position 128 (0x80) differs. The possible reason is that mstore(0x80, r) might have been incorrectly removed.

The explanation given in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15362 also applies here from what I can tell, so I'm closing this one already as a duplicate (I think the other one can also be closed, since so far the cases are valid optimizations)

I don't think this is a duplicate of the example in #15362. #15363 causes the value in sstore to change, while #15362 only changes the value in mstore. Could you please let me know if my reasoning is valid?

At least in the "execution result analysis" section of this issue the storage trace in both cases is identical - what makes you say that the value in the ``sstore`` changes?

Thank you, i had a mistake.
