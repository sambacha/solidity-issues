# [\#15364 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15364) `closed`: Output selection `evm.deployedBytecode.*` with `Yul` as language should error.

The compiler should not just accept the following JSON:
```Json
{
  "language": "Yul",
  "settings": {
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "*": [
          "evm.deployedBytecode.sourceMap"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "fileA": {
      "content": "{}"
    }
  }
}
```

Current behaviour:
```
‚ùØ solc/solc --standard-json test.json
{"errors":[]}
```

The output names in `outputSelection` are not validated. The last time I brought it up, in #12153, it turned out that tooling prefers it that way so I don't think we'll be changing it.

Close as won't do?
