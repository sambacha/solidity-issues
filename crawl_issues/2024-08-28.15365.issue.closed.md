# [\#15365 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15365) `closed`: add support for `abi.encodePackedFixed`/`abi.decodePackedFixed`
**Labels**: `closed due inactivity`, `stale`, `feature`

Currently there're `abi.encode, abi.decode, abi.encodePacked` but there is no `abi.decodePacked`.

The reason is simple: both `abi.encodePacked("abc", "de")`  and `abi.encodePacked("ab", "cde")` returns `abcde`, so it's impossible to decode `abcde`.

The root cause is that `bytes/string` are dynamic-sized types.

We can restrict the types to those with fixed sizes, e.g., `uint64`/`uint32` etc.

So I propose solidity can support these builtin functions:

`abi.encodePackedFixed`/`abi.decodePackedFixed`


Example usages:

```solidity
uint32 v1 = 32;
uint64 v2 = 64;
bytes memory packed = abi.encodePackedFixed(v1, v2);

(decodedV1, decodecV2) = abi.decodePackedFixed(packed, (uint32, uint64));

assertEq(v1 == decodedV1 && v2 == decodecV2);
```

These apis should revert if dynamic types are passed in.

Hi everyone! This issue has been automatically closed due to inactivity.
If you think this issue is still relevant in the latest Solidity version and you have something to [contribute](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html), feel free to reopen.
However, unless the issue is a concrete proposal that can be implemented, we recommend starting a language discussion on the [forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) instead.
