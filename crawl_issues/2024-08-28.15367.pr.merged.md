Ah wait. Just realized that the initial commits here are also in #15356. So some of my comments really should have gone into that other PR.

Dependencies of this kind should be mentioned in the description. We also have a `has dependencies` label that we can put on such PRs to avoid mistakenly reviewing or merging them out of order.

Ah wait, I didn't mean to approve yet. But well, given that you're fixing this as we speak, it would be approved in a moment anyway I guess.
