This PR prepares the BMC engine for the switch from Z3 as a library to Z3 using SMT-LIB interface.
Separated from #15252.

The PR consists of two commits.
One adds the new interface class that BMC engine will use instead of `Z3Interface`.

The other one fixes parsing of model values in BMC.
SMT solvers return model values as pairs (enclosed in parentheses) of name and value.
Previous way of parsing model values relied on finding the next closing bracket. However, this does not work for negative numbers, which are themselves wrapped in parentheses, e.g. (- 1).
We can now use our SMT-LIB parser to parse these values properly.
