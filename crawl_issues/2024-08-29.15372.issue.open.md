Currently, there are two CLI flags for showing results for individual targets: `--model-checker-show-proved-safe` and `--model-checker-show-unproved`.

It would be good to unify the format of these options and drop `safe` from the first one.
`--model-checker-show-proved` should be sufficient.

The same is true for the corresponding JSON options.

There was originally even a mismatch between the implementation and the documentation, see #https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15304
