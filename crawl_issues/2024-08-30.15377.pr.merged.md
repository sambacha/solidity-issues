# [\#15377 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15377) `merged`: Tweak advanced CMake options
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`, `:yellow_circle:`

Some tweaks to names and descriptions of options added in #15195. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15081#issuecomment-2100797921 for context.

I'd like to get that in before the release, while the options are still relatively fresh so that we're not stuck with them as is forever.
