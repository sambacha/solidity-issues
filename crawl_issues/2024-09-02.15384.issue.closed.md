## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.26
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): None
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: None

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
contract C {
    uint256 public num;
    function f() public returns (uint256) {
        bool _b=false;
        assembly {
            let encoded := mload(0x40)
            mstore(encoded, _b)
            let decoded := mload(encoded)
            switch decoded
            case 1 { mstore(0x40, 1) }
            default { mstore(0x40, 0) }
        }
        num = abi.decode(abi.encode(_b), (uint256));
        return num;
    }
}
```
### Legacy Codegen
output
```
0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
### IR-based Codegen
output
```
0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
The result output by the Legacy Codegen is not 0, which is incorrect.

Hey @Subway2023!

This behaviour is not a bug.

The sample code is corrupting the free memory pointer via inline assembly (by overwriting it with 1 or 0). This results in undefined behaviour. In this case specifically, `abi.encode()` allocates memory and the allocated area probably overlaps with the free memory pointer location, the zero slot, or variables moved to memory. We strongly recommend against doing so. This is similar to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15391#issuecomment-2326081058 and you can check out @ekpyron's [response](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15391#issuecomment-2326081058) for further context.

Closing this based on the above rationale.
