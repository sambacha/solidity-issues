**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `:yellow_circle:`

Fixes #14816.

The PR makes it possible to run `docker_deploy_manual.sh` without getting a new checkout of the repo or pushing the resulting image. With that we can run the build in CI and avoid breakage suddenly appearing during releases.

I'm also removing support for the `release` branch, which we no longer use.

Still a draft, because I made it run in PRs to test it. When it succeeds, I'm going to remove the commit that enables it and make it reviewable.

Note that this job us using a remote Docker container, which is where the docker build and execution happens. This means that we're actually paying for two containers running at the same time. This is a medium-sized Linux container though and those are relatively cheap so it does not make that much difference. And the job is going to only run nightly which makes it a complete non-issue.

Looks like it builds and passes my smoke test: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/35754/workflows/48ffdd06-d6cc-41e2-81d9-81629af74447/jobs/1627821/steps
