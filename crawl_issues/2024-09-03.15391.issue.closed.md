## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.26
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:

## Steps to Reproduce
```solidity
contract BugDetectionContract {
    function returnStoredValue() external returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory storedValue;
        assembly {
            let memPtr := mload(0x40)
            storedValue := mload(memPtr)
            mstore(add(storedValue, 0x40), 0)
            
        }
        return storedValue;
    }
}
```

```
Why is there a difference in the return values? Shouldn't they all be 0?

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract C {
    uint[][] a;
    uint[] b;
    function g() public returns (uint[] memory) {
        uint[] storage c = b;
        assembly {
            mstore(0x40, 0)
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```
have the same problem.

Solidity uses memory offset ``0x40`` as free memory pointer for memory management (see https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/assembly.html#memory-management). Furthermore, it relies on being able to use memory offsets 0-64 as scratch space and memory offset ``0x60`` as zero pointer. Manually interfering with the free memory pointer results (setting it to values below its initial value) generally results in undefined behaviour. Furthermore, memory cannot be assumed to be zeroed before a first write to it. In the given cases in particular, the value read from ``memPtr``, so the value in ``storedValue`` already is undefined. It will probably be zero, which means that the subsequent write to ``0x40`` sets the free memory pointer to an invalid state. Now preparing returndata results in overlapping reads and write to memory for ABI encoding the returndata.

To produce consistent behaviour you generally need to respect Solidity's memory model within inline assembly, if you mix assembly and high-level code.
