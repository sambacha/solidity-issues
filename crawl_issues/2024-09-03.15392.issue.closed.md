## Description

When compiling with z3, there is still error, which is similar to [13178](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13178) and [13121](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/13121). However, I still don't know how to compile it successfully. I need to use smtchecker.

## Environment
- Z3 version: 4.12.1
- Compiler version: 0.8.26
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce
```
/mnt/sdd1/sbw/diffSolidity/solidity-0.8.26/libsmtutil/Z3Interface.cpp: In member function ‘solidity::smtutil::Expression solidity::smtutil::Z3Interface::fromZ3Expr(const z3::expr&)’:
/mnt/sdd1/sbw/diffSolidity/solidity-0.8.26/libsmtutil/Z3Interface.cpp:392:25: error: ‘Z3_OP_RECURSIVE’ was not declared in this scope; did you mean ‘Z3_OP_RE_UNION’?

      |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

make[2]: *** [libsmtutil/CMakeFiles/smtutil.dir/build.make:160: libsmtutil/CMakeFiles/smtutil.dir/Z3Interface.cpp.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/Makefile2:507: libsmtutil/CMakeFiles/smtutil.dir/all] Error 2
make: *** [Makefile:136: all] Error 2
```
My Z3 version matches the one required in the documentation, but I still can't compile it successfully.
