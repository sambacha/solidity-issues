New mantic packages are rejected since mantic is EOL.
Adding oracular (24.10) even though it's unreleased as of yet (we should watch the build in https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-dev/+packages - but since it's unreleased oracular is not live yet, it failing wouldn't be a blocker)
