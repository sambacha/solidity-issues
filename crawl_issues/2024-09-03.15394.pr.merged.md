No opened issue for this (and thus linked in the TODO), since it will be addressed immediately, and fix only merged *after* the release.

It's not a build requirement - it's just a "weird test case" requirement :-).

It is absolutely possible to trigger for the user so it's not test-only. It's definitely obscure, which is why I'm not protesting too strongly, but the failing test is just exposing broken functionality.
