## Description

When solc is run on the command line using `--standard-json` and the code contains YUL tstore, it generates a warning but no bytecode. @r0qs told me, if I remember correctly, that it seems to be because the warnings are treated as an error(?) and so the compiler exits without generating the bytecode in the `--standard-json` behaviour. This is unexpected.

## Environment

- Compiler version: `Version: 0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a.Linux.g++` linux static binary, as downloaded from Release page
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): no specific target specified
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): command line
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: none specified
- Operating system: `Linux archlinux 6.10.4-arch2-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sun, 11 Aug 2024 16:19:06 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

## Steps to Reproduce

```shell
echo '{"language":"Yul","settings":{"optimizer":{"enabled": false, "details":{"yulDetails":{"optimizerSteps":":"}}},"outputSelection":{"*":{"":["ast"],"*":["metadata","evm.bytecode","evm.deployedBytecode","abi","storageLayout","evm.bytecode.sourceMap","evm.bytecode.linkReferences","evm.bytecode.generatedSources","evm.deployedBytecode.sourceMap","evm.deployedBytecode.linkReferences","evm.deployedBytecode.generatedSources","evm.deployedBytecode.immutableReferences"]}}},"sources":{"hevm.sol":{"content":"{
calldatacopy(0,0,1024)
     tstore(0, 42)
     tstore(0, 42)
     let x := tload(0)
     tstore(0, 42)
     x := tload(0)
     tstore(0, 24)
     x := tload(0)
     tstore(0, 24)
 }
"}}}' | ./solc-static-linux --standard-json
```

This should result in some bytecode. But it does not. Instead we get:

```
{"errors":[{"component":"general","formattedMessage":"Warning: Transient storage as defined by EIP-1153 can break the composability of smart contracts: Since transient storage is cleared only at the end of the transaction and not at the end of the outermost call frame to the contract within a transaction, your contract may unintentionally misbehave when invoked multiple times in a complex transaction.

The use of transient storage for reentrancy guards that are cleared at the end of the call is safe.\n --> hevm.sol:3:6:\n  |\n3 |      tstore(0, 42)\n  |      ^^^^^^\n\n","message":"Transient storage as defined by EIP-1153 can break the composability of smart contracts: Since transient storage is cleared only at the end of the transaction and not at the end of the outermost call frame to the contract within a transaction, your contract may unintentionally misbehave when invoked multiple times in a complex transaction.

The use of transient storage for reentrancy guards that are cleared at the end of the call is safe.","severity":"warning","sourceLocation":{"end":36,"file":"hevm.sol","start":30},"type":"Warning"}]}
```


## More Concise Formulation

Consider the following yul code:
```
{
  let x := tload(0)
  tstore(add(x, 1), 0)
}
```

Compiling it via command line results in the following:
```
../solc-0.8.26 --strict-assembly --ir-optimized --optimize  --bin --asm transient.yul
Warning: Transient storage as defined by EIP-1153 can break the composability of smart contracts: Since transient storage is cleared only at the end of the transaction and not at the end of the outermost call frame to the contract within a transaction, your contract may unintentionally misbehave when invoked multiple times in a complex transaction. To avoid this, be sure to clear all transient storage at the end of any call to your contract. The use of transient storage for reentrancy guards that are cleared at the end of the call is safe.
 --> transient.yul:3:3:
  |
3 |   tstore(add(x, 1), 0)
  |   ^^^^^^


======= transient.yul (EVM) =======

Pretty printed source:
object "object" {
    code {
        { tstore(add(tload(0), 1), 0) }
    }
}


Binary representation:
5f6001815c015d00

Text representation:
    /* "transient.yul":19:20   */
  0x00
    /* "transient.yul":38:39   */
  0x01
    /* "transient.yul":13:21   */
  dup2
  tload
    /* "transient.yul":31:40   */
  add
    /* "transient.yul":24:44   */
  tstore
    /* "transient.yul":0:46   */
  stop
```

However, if we use the standard-json output:
```json
{
	"language": "Yul",
	"sources":
	{
		"C":
		{
			"content": "{ let x := tload(0) tstore(add(x, 1), 0) }"
		}
	},
	"settings":
	{
		"optimizer": {
			"enabled": true,
			"details": {
				"yul": true
			}
		},
		"viaIR": true,
		"outputSelection":
		{
			"*": {
				"*": ["evm.bytecode", "evm.assembly", "irOptimized"],
				"": [ "*" ]
			}
		}
	}
}
```
It does not generate code:
``` shell
../solc-0.8.26 --standard-json y.input.json
{
	"errors":[{
	"component":"general",
	"formattedMessage":"Warning: Transient storage as defined by EIP-1153 can break the composability of smart contracts: Since transient storage is cleared only at the end of the transaction and not at the end of the outermost call frame to the contract within a transaction, your contract may unintentionally misbehave when invoked multiple times in a complex transaction.

	"message":"Transient storage as defined by EIP-1153 can break the composability of smart contracts: Since transient storage is cleared only at the end of the transaction and not at the end of the outermost call frame to the contract within a transaction, your contract may unintentionally misbehave when invoked multiple times in a complex transaction.

}
```
