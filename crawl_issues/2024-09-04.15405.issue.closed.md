## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.27
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): None
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract C {
    struct S { uint x; }
    uint[] storageArray;
    bytes memoryArray;
    function g(uint x) public {
        for (uint i = 0; i < x; ++i) {
            storageArray.push(i);
        }
    }
    function f(uint a) public returns (uint, uint) {
        if (a > 1) {
            g(a);
            assembly {
                let temp := sload(storageArray.slot)
                sstore(temp, msize())
            }
        }
        memoryArray = abi.encode(storageArray);
        return (storageArray.length, storageArray[0]);
    }
}
```
```
solc --via-ir --bin test.sol
```
```

`msize()` disables the optimization pass that can fix "stack too deep".

Hey @Subway2023!

Thanks for raising this issue. This case runs into a `StackTooDeep` error due to the use of the `msize()` opcode in your code. The `msize()` opcode makes the compiler disable the Yul optimizer. And this happens, because `msize()` makes our memory optimizations unsafe. What this means is that it is currently not guaranteed that the amount of memory accessed will remain the same and this fact may alter contract behaviour. However, this won't be fixed directly at the moment but the hope is that our work around improving the Yul -> EVM transformations and by the dups and swaps in EOF ([EIP-663](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-663)) would eliminate cases of unoptimised code leading to stack-too-deep errors, such as yours, in general.

This, IMO, serves as grounds for closing the issue for now.
