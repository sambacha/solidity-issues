Yes, I was thinking about maybe writing a specific session or paragraphs explaining it better and also including some references to eip-1153.

One more small detail that may be worth updating. Under [Security Considerations > Sending and Receiving Ether](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/security-considerations.html#sending-and-receiving-ether) we say:

> During the execution of one of these functions, the contract can only rely on the “gas stipend” it is passed (2300 gas) being available to it at that time. This stipend is not enough to modify storage (do not take this for granted though, the stipend might change with future hard forks).

Looks like [EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200) ensures that this will not be the case for storage even if the cost changes. The cost actually did change and warm storage access now costs less than the stipend, which is probably the reason for this. On the other hand it might be worth mentioning that transient storage is not subject to this.
