The procedure to update z3 is unfortunately a bit more complicated than this. It will require updating test expectations, and AFAIK https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/7255 is still a blocker for this (@blishko is that still the case?).

It also cannot be easily done in an external PR, since we need the PR to trigger the base CI image rebuild via Github Actions. For this reason I'm going to close this. We still have #15198 open though, and we do intend to update when blockers are resolved.

@cameel got it, do you have any concerns that homebrew ship the binary built with z3 4.13.0 then? thanks!

Not really. The Z3 issue is about it hanging in some scenarios, but the output is still correct when you do get an answer. 4.12 might be a better choice if you hit those hanging cases but 4.13 has some improvements and bugfixes too so I can't even say that one is recommended over the other. Both versions are supported, we still support anything >= 4.8, it's just that 4.12 is still the one we run our tests against. The `STRICT_Z3_VERSION` option forces that specific version by default, but it can be disabled and is there mostly to guide people who don't have a strong preference to choose the one that can pass the test suite, which is unfortunately bound to a single version.
