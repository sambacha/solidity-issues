While [regression build solidity](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/183889), I saw it always pull the deps rather than using the system deps, thus updating the build to prefer system deps

We have the `IGNORE_VENDORED_DEPENDENCIES=ON` option for this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/09e9aa65c68a650c8ccf9b745c04e72aba9e1793/CMakeLists.txt#L40-L45

The only difference is that it does not run `find_package()`, but that could be added as an `else` here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/09e9aa65c68a650c8ccf9b745c04e72aba9e1793/CMakeLists.txt#L60-L64

Which I'd expect to be necessary. I wonder why it worked without it for @aarlt (who added it) though?

Hey @chenrui333! Thanks for your contribution. Initially I created this `IGNORE_VENDORED_DEPENDENCIES` mechanism so that the solidity libraries can be easily used within `vcpkg`. The idea of that first version was, that a "root" cmake file will just search for the dependencies. However, we changed some internal libraries since then and I just did a small test here https://github.com/aarlt/cmake_vcpkg_solidity and it looks like that everything should just work, if you do what @cameel suggested. Just add an `else` to `if (NOT IGNORE_VENDORED_DEPENDENCIES)`  in `solidity/CMakeLists.txt`, where you just ad `find_package`'s for `fmt`, `nlohmann_json` and `range-v3`.
