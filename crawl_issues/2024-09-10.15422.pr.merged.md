The idea here is to introduce the 2404 images to circleCI config (without actually making use of them). @rodiazet is then to make use of these new images in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15320, and only for the 3 or so failing jobs (soltest, force release, etc.), which will allow the evmone bump to pass all of the tests and be merged. We can then update the rest of the jobs to make use of 2404 images wherever appropriate, but in another PR.
