# [\#15424 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15424) `open`: When accessing an out-of-bounds index in a fixed-size array, the contract execution reverts
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3013114?u=2441d56fe9cbbb607a896d93a1a4ee9693f40dad&v=4" width="50">[3mp8r3](https://github.com/3mp8r3) opened issue at [2024-09-10 12:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15424):

When accessing an out-of-bounds index in a fixed-size array, the contract execution reverts. However, the error message provided is a generic revert message that doesn't specify the exact cause of the error.

## Reproducible Example
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

contract Array {
    
    uint [6] public arr = [1,2,3];

    function insertElement(uint index, uint value) public {
        arr[index]= value;
    }

    function returnAllElement() public view returns (uint [6] memory) {
        return arr;
    }

    function returnElement(uint index) public view returns (uint) {
        return arr[index];
    }

}
## Steps to Reproduce
Deploy the above contract
Now attempt to access an index that is out of bounds, e.g. arr[8]
Call returnElement(6) or any index >= 6
Current Error Message
call to Array.returnElement errored: Error occurred: revert.
revert
The transaction has been reverted to the initial state.
Note: The called function should be payable if you send value and the value you send should be less than your current balance.
You may want to cautiously increase the gas limit if the transaction went out of gas.
Expected Behavior
The error message should clearly indicate that the index is out of bounds for the array

## Actual Behavior
The transaction is reverted with a misleading error message that mentions payable functions and gas limits

Suggested Improvement
Consider updating the error message to clearly state "Array index out of bounds" or similar.

## Environment
Compiler version: 0.8.26
Framework/IDE : Remix
EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
Operating system: mac OS Somoa 14.3.1 (23D60)
