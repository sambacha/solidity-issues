# [\#15433 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15433) `merged`: Per-contract output selection in `CompilerStack`
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `:yellow_circle:`

Fixes #15373.
Depends on #15447.

Turned out to be less tedious than expected, though TBH contract and output selection feels like something that shouldn't really be a part of `CompilerStack` and should sit in `StandardCompiler` instead.
