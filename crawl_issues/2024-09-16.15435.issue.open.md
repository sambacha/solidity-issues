Prerequisite for #15358.

## Abstract

A reliable Yul interpreter that can evaluate expressions with no side-effects and handle basic control flow would be very useful in Yul optimizer.

Currently we only have a [**very** rudimentary EVM-level intepreter in `ConstantOptimiser`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.27/libyul/backends/evm/ConstantOptimiser.cpp#L41-L89) (can handle only `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `EXP`, `SHL` and `NOT`) and [a more full featured Yul interpreter](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/test/tools/yulInterpreter) that was built with testing in mind and is not robust enough for production use. For example it uses [hard-coded values for some built-ins](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.27/test/tools/yulInterpreter/Interpreter.h#L85-L120), [there are bits of code that are designed for fail randomly for fuzzing](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.27/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L376-L377) and [has various bits that are just stubs](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/v0.8.27/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L265).

However, the core part of the test interpreter limited to side-effect-free evaluation looks like it should be a good-enough starting point. We could make it reliable.

## Specification

- Extract a subset of `test/tools/yulInterpreter/` into `libyul`.
    - Just handle control flow and have aborting conditions for anything that doesn't fall in scope (including memory access, reverts, etc.).
    - Donâ€™t handle memory/storage/calldata/returndata.
    - Beyond control flow, just handle plain "pure" opcodes, e.g. arithmetic, etc., anything just producing values purely from other values on stack.
    - The interpreter should be agnostic to the set of builtins.
- The current interpreter should keep working as is for testing and fuzzing purposes. It should become an extension of the new interpreter, but still be kept in test suite, not `libyul`.
- The side-effect-free part of the interpreter should be covered with enough tests to give us confidence that the behavior exactly matches that of the EVM.
    - Use `YulInterpreterTest` for testing and keep test cases small and modular.
    - Refer to the [execution spec](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/tree/master/src/ethereum/cancun/vm/instructions) for detailed description of each EVM instruction. Note that not all instructions are available on all EVM versions.
