<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

`uint[] memory b = new uint[](3); b[0] = 1;` is allowed.
`uint x = 1;` is allowed.
But, `uint[3] memory a = [1,2,3];` is disallowed.
Seems type inference is inconsistent here.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28-develop.2024.9.23+commit.33b67f0a.Darwin.appleclang
- Operating system: macos

## Steps to Reproduce

Below is a reproducible test program.
```solidity
contract A {

  function f() external pure {}

  function g() pure internal {
    uint[3] memory a = [1,2,3]; // error
    uint[] memory b = new uint[](3);
    b[0] = 1;
    uint x = 1;
  }
}
```

I found a post related to this issue: https://forum.soliditylang.org/t/missing-implicit-type-conversions/2004.
Seems that initializing a static array in Solidity is not recommended.
