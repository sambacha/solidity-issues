- Separate common code from `assembleLegacy` and `assebleEOF` to be reused.
- Separate big and unreadable `switch`s to corresponding functions.

> Perfect.

> I'd have merged it already but noticed some typos that I wanted to correct first. I wanted to just do it myself, but could not push a commit to your branch. I pushed a new branch instead: [`eof-prep-4-refactor`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/eof-prep-4-refactor). This solves the extra comments I left below. If you pull it into your branch and squash, we can merge.

Done. You can merge.
