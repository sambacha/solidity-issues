# [\#15447 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15447) `merged`: Output selection tests
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-09-23 14:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15447):

Prerequisite for #15433.
Related to #12153.

Regression tests I want in #15433 to make sure I'm not changing the current behavior of output selection. I'm not yet done with #15433, but we should have such tests in general, so we could merge them already.

Also some renaming of older tests to make them use the same convention.
