# [\#15451 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15451) `merged`: Do not store JSON Yul ASTs and Yul CFG in `CompilerStack`
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `:yellow_circle:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-09-24 15:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15451):

~Depends on #15457.~ Merged.

This fixes excessive memory usage due to JSON representation of Yul ASTs and Yul CFG being always calculated from IR, even if not requested as an output.

The PR fixes the problem by changing `CompilerStack` so that these artifacts are only prepared when requested by CLI or `StandardCompiler`. This requires reparsing the IR from scratch each time (and the PR *does not* go out of its way to ensure it's parsed only once if multiple ASTs are requested), but Yul parsing is generally fast and these artifacts are not needed in the typical Solidity development workflow anyway.

### Effects
This has a huge impact on memory usage and also non-negligible impact on running time.

For example when compiling Uniswap using our [external benchmarks](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/benchmarks/external.sh), disabling generation of this data makes it go from 143 s and 5 GB RAM down to 115 s and 1.5 GB RAM.

I've been noticing the aggressive RAM usage for a while now, to the point that I had to be careful when running the external benchmarks - compiling Eigenlayer or Sablier sometimes required more than 30 GB RAM and would crash on my machine.

Note: For the last two the numbers do not represent the whole project, because in each there is a contract that fails to compile due to a StackTooDeep error.

### Legacy pipeline
There should be zero difference here since these artifacts are only generated when IR is requested.
They're still potentially useful to see what the variance of these numbers is (they come from a single run).

An interesting thing is that this overhead of JSON processing did not show up in profiling I did recently: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15179#issuecomment-2324644291. I'd expect to see `YulStack::astJson()` there, bit I can't see any JSON-related functions at all on any of the diagrams. I wonder if it might be something along the lines of the overhead coming from system memory management and the profiler does not counting that?

One thing I do see is `YulStack::parseAndAnalyze()` taking 6% of execution for Uniswap on `develop`, which might indicate that all that extra reparsing may be starting to add up. Or not - this is the only diagram where I see it so it could also be a fluke.

Not sure if it is _the_ problem leading to it, but it may be a problem regardless:
I did a little experiment and compared the output of 
```cpp
contract(_contractName).yulIROptimized
```
with the output of
```cpp
loadGeneratedIR(loadGeneratedIR(loadGeneratedIR(contract(_contractName).yulIROptimized).print()).print()).print()
```
just to see if it stays consistent under repeated loading and printing operations. It doesn't:

Also the difference is multiples of `17`, which is consistent with the length of `  "contract C {}"` - so I recon that it is the problem after all

There probably is something to it, the exact 17 char difference is too specific, but at least in the snippet above the cause is just the way you print it.

`yulIROptimized` was generated with `print(*this)`, where `this` is the `CompilerStack`. The parameter is an object that can provide access to sources, which are needed if you want to print debug snippets. Plain `print()` without an argument does not have access to it and won't print those snippets.

I'm trying to debug it but, oddly, after rebasing this I cannot reproduce this difference locally. The test passes for me somehow. I haven't tried it before the rebase, so I'm not sure if it's just not reproducible on my machine in general or if it's the rebase that changed something...

EDIT: It still fails in CI so it's not the rebase.

I think I figured it out. Looks like my previous fix for native locations (#15457) did not properly account for code snippets in debug info and I did not notice that. TBH it's quite hard to notice when these offsets are wrong in test output and verifying them all manually is not feasible - which is the reason why we had the original issue in the first place.

New fix: #15457.

I did some more benchmarking and profiling on top of this.

First I ran our profiling (`PROFILE_OPTIMIZER_STEPS` CMake option) to see how long each step takes. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15465#issuecomment-2382670992 for detailed results.

I also checked how long each part of the pipeline takes now:

|                             | OpenZeppelin | Uniswap | Eigenlayer |
|-----------------------------|-------------:|--------:|-----------:|
| Compilation (optimized)     |         32 s |   117 s |      514 s |
| Optimizer steps             |         18 s |    61 s |      261 s |
| Compilation (unoptimized)   |         15 s |    49 s |      212 s |
| Compilation (only IR generation) |          4 s |    10 s |       37 s |
| Compilation (only analysis) |          1 s |     2 s |        2 s |

The numbers are from running full compilation with only specific outputs selected, except for "Optimizer steps", which is the time I got from profiling optimization steps in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15465#issuecomment-2382670992.

The same in relative terms:
|                             | OpenZeppelin | Uniswap | Eigenlayer |
|-----------------------------|-------------:|--------:|-----------:|
| Compilation (optimized)     |         100% |    100% |       100% |
| Optimizer steps             |          56% |     52% |        51% |
| Compilation (unoptimized)   |          47% |     42% |        41% |
| Compilation (only IR generation) |          13% |      9% |         7% |
| Compilation (only analysis) |           3% |      2% |         0% |

### Conclusions
- Optimization time is now down to 50-60% of the total.
- IR generation and analysis are only ~10% of the total. The rest is optimization and bytecode generation.
- CSE is the single slowest step, taking 20% of the optimization time.
- Results are pretty consistent between projects. Top 10 steps are (almost) the same and relative running times are very similar too.
