This fixes the issue with shifted source locations we're seeing in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15451#issuecomment-2371628772. Or, more accurately, turns it into a proper fix, because the shift is actually correct and it's the test expectation that was wrong.

Turns out that my assumption in #15309 that we don't need access to code snippets in `YulStack` when reparsing Obviously, if we parse different source than we output, we'll get wrong AST locations.

I think that Yul AST is the only artifact affected. We normally only include origin source locations in the output and print nothing if the native location is the only thing we have. The only way to see native locations is to look into the AST.

Looks good to me aside from the mini typo :)
