Depends on #15451.

This is a follow-up to #15451, removing more of the data cached in `CompilerStack`: `metadata`, `abi`, `storageLayout`, `transientStorageLayout`, `userDocumentation`, `devDocumentation`, `generatedSources` and `runtimeGeneratedSources` are now always generated on demand.

This is a test PR to benchmark it see if it's even worth it.

If it's going to be merged, we should perhaps check if some of these aren't used a lot internally and better off cached after all.

### Benchmarks
Results from `external.sh`, averaged over 3 runs. #15451 vs this PR.

|         File | Pipeline | Time (before) | Time (after) | Memory (before) | Memory (after) |
|--------------|----------|--------------:|-------------:|---------------:|---------------:|
| openzeppelin |   legacy |         10  s |        9   s |       517  MiB |       448  MiB |
| openzeppelin |       ir |         33  s |        32  s |       497  MiB |       508  MiB |
| uniswap-v4   |   legacy |         21  s |        20  s |       1012 MiB |       964  MiB |
| uniswap-v4   |       ir |         119 s |        119 s |       1494 MiB |       1493 MiB |
| eigenlayer   |   legacy |         74  s |        73  s |       2835 MiB |       2444 MiB |

Looks like timing is the same. Memory use did fall a little on legacy, but on IR is practically unaffected.

The only field that's legacy-only are generated sources, so it seems that it's just those that are worth getting rid of.

Closing in favor of #15460. Looks like all the gains here are indeed due to generated sources.
