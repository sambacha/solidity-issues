The CI run's a subset of Hardhat tests, but we have migrated those tests to the [EDR](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/edr) repo. This is still working because we also kept the old tests in the Hardhat repo, but we want to remove them. Before doing that though, we need to point solc's CI to the EDR repo.

I tested the steps locally with the latest `soljson.js` built by the CI, and it worked fine, but we won't know for sure until it actually runs in the CI.

Merged it for now - but we should look indeed also look into the other disabled tests and workarounds and see what we can remove now!

Thanks for merging this! Franco is going to be OOO for a few weeks. Once he's back, we'll update the other repo and resolve the issues around disabled tests.

In the meantime, we won't delete any test from hardhat's repository.
