This interpreter implementation is following this specification from #15435 , and is intended to use in #15358 .

This PR has followed spec for the implementation.

For testing, the existing `YulInterpreterTest` was not used. This is because this pure interpreter has no memory/storage access, it can not use the same trace as the current interpreter from 'test/libyul/tools'. But to keep it minimal, the `YulInterpreterTest` test suit was copied and applied minimal changes. The new test suit now uses the function call trace and the outter most variable values for snapshot comparison. Most of the existing test from the `YulInterpreterTest` was ported to the new test suit. New tests were also added to test all return status, as well as to test all evm instructions.

The PR needs a rebase.

Also note that some EOF-related PRs were merged recently. There were some minor changes in the interpreter, please take a look at history. Especially with #15467 you'll probably need to pass `EOFVersion` to the `Dialect`.

I have rebased this branch to the recent develop, and I think I have addressed most of the change request. Please help take a look.

There is still the request about the test suite. I'll add some tests to a new branch, and merge the test suite later.
