## Description
As described in [Address Literals](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#address-literals), hex literals of the correct size that pass the checksum test are of address type.
An incorrect size of 38 can be converted to uint256, but a correct size of 39 that fail the checksum cannot be converted to uint256, which is confusing.
<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28
- Operating system: macos

## Steps to Reproduce
Below is the reproducible test program:
```solidity
function f() {
  address adr = 0xde74fE3E9482D11dAeBE981C1f5Bf1e5E3055c31; // pass
  address adr2 = 0xde74fE3E9482D11dAeBE981C1f5Bf1e5E3055c3; // fail
  uint256 a = 0xde74fE3E9482D11dAeBE981C1f5Bf1e5E3055c3; // fail
  uint256 b = 0xde74fE3E9482D11dAeBE981C1f5Bf1e5E3055c; // pass
}
```
