<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

1. Given a global function such as 
```solidity
function f(uint8 b) {
  uint16 a = b;
  a = a / a;
}
```
or a member function such as 
```solidity
function f(uint256 b) private returns (uint256) {
    b = b / b;
  }
```
CHC cannot detect "divide by 0" counterexample.

2. Given a public member function in a contract such as
```solidity
contract C {
  function g(uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
    return b = b / b;
  }
}
```
the output of CHC contains errors, such as
```
Warning: CHC: Division by zero happens here.
Counterexample:

b = 0
 = 0

Transaction trace:
C.constructor()
C.g(0)
  --> test2.sol:16:16:
   |
16 |     return b = b / b;
   |                ^^^^^

```
In the above warning message given by CHC,  ` = 0` is misleading.

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version:0.8.28
- Operating system: macos

## Steps to Reproduce

Here is a reproducible test program
```solidity

function f(uint8 b) {
  uint16 a = b;
  a = a / a;
}

function g(uint8 b) {
  b = b / b;
}

contract C {
  function f(uint256 b) private returns (uint256) {
    b = b / b;
  }
  function g(uint256 b) public returns (uint256) {
    return b = b / b;
  }
}
```

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.
