Somewhat random, but I saw it the other day when checking the optimizer step runtime numbers and skimming through it...
Whoever can tell me for sure how many copies this saves gets a beer - whoever can give me a closed arithmetic expression describing the number of ``YulName`` comparisons this saves gets five beers.

But yeah, at some point we need to properly systematically look through these things and reduce their computational complexity.
