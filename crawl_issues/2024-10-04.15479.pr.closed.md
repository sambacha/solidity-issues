@blacroc10 Sorry, but this is the kind of contribution we're generally not interested in. The PR is just a random micro-optimization for the sake of it. It's also very sloppy (e.g. it completely disregards the style of the surrounding code by rewriting randomly replacing all indents in the middle of a file).
