Closing this since it's just a UK vs US English difference, and we have a ton of them anyway, so setting a precedent of fixing these one or two words at a time is a bad idea overall.

I think it's good idea to use US or UK, Throughout the docs there are some words used in US then same words on same page used in UK.

Thank you @nikola-matic

You are absolutely right, but this is a recurring theme not only in our docs, but in the code base as well, and accepting PRs that change a couple of words at a time would set a bad precedent, where we could potentially be overwhelmed by the amount of PRs doing just that.
