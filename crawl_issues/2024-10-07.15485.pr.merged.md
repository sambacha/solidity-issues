RTD is no longer injecting certain HTML elements, such as the flyout menu, and they are replacing these components with addons (see: https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/11474). Unfortunately, addons does not work out-of-the-box with the customizations we have implemented - specifically, having a fixed flyout menu at the bottom of the sidebar in our docs. 

The issue is because we explicitly use certain CSS selectors (e.g., `.rst-versions`) to determine where to place the flyout menu, and the current code relied on such selector and didn't properly handle cases where such selector would not be present, breaking the layout with a type error since `rstVersions` is `null`. And the same applies for other selectors that are removed in this PR.

The addons are enabled by default in the RTD dashboard, and it appears that we cannot disable them, see: https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/11474#issuecomment-2392284548.

You can see the docs of this PR here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/rtd-docs-workaround/
And some old broken version here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.27/ (check the browser console for the error)

Note that this PR does not resolve the layout issues for older versions; it only applies to new releases. To keep older versions somewhat usable, the `Flyout` option should be enabled in the RTD dashboard.

The PR also introduces checks to safely access properties or call methods on potentially null or undefined objects.

The docs ci build failing is an issue, though :-)
