<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

Below is the reproducible program:
```solidity
contract A {
  struct S {
    int a;
  }
  S st;
  function foo(S calldata sc) public {
    S memory sm;
    sm = sc; // pass
    sm = st; // pass
    sm = true ? sc : st; // fail: True expression's type struct A.S calldata does not match false expression's type struct A.S storage pointer
  }
}
```

Seems that `st`'s type is lifted to a storage pointer and the pointer is incompatible with `sc`'s type calldata.
Is it an intentional behavior? Seems that the only workaround is writing a `if else` to avoid the ternery.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28

You explicitly state sm is a struct in memory. Yet, you then try to create an execution path that will assign it to a struct in storage? The compiler treats memory as memory and storage as storage and has completely different methods for dealing with each. This is the type system working, it has prevented you from using storage methods on a memory object. The correct way to handle this would be to create an if statement and load the storage data into the memory object conditionally.

I guess the problem here is not the type system prevents me from using storage methods on a memory object, since it actually allows me to do so on the line `sm = st; // pass`. It also allows me to send calldata data to memory slot on the line `sm = sc; // pass`. But my question is, why does it disallow such previously allowed behavior on line `sm = true ? sc : st;`
with an excuse `True expression's type struct A.S calldata does not match false expression's type struct A.S storage pointer`. I guess it's more like a type system problem in analyzing a conditional expression.
