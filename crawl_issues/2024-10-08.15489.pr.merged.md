We should probably get rid of `codecov.yml` as well. There was this doubt whether fuzzing depends on `codecov`, but I somehow doubt it. I'd say let's remove it and we can always restore if things break.

Also docker images install the `codecov` package, which is probably also unnecessary. Though this would require rebuilding the images, which makes it a hassle, so that may be better done later, together with evmone update.
