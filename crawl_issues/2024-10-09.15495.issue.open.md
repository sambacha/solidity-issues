# [\#15495 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15495) `open`: Update release docker builds scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`, `selected for development`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2024-10-09 11:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15495):

Without manual edit, the docker deploy script fails for recent versions of docker with
```
unknown flag: --progress
See 'docker build --help'.
```
Furthermore we get
```
DEPRECATED: The legacy builder is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
            Install the buildx component to build images with BuildKit:
            https://docs.docker.com/go/buildx/
```
We should look into updating to the new style of builds (which also apparently still has a ``--progress`` flag).
