This PR introduces enhancements to the `ContractInterface` class, aimed at improving its functionality while maintaining compatibility with existing code and dependencies. The modifications focus on refining method signatures, ensuring const-correctness, and enhancing code readability and maintainability.

### Key Changes

- **Improved Method Signatures:**
  - The methods in `ContractInterface` have been updated to take parameters by value (e.g., `const std::string&`) instead of pointers. This change enhances const-correctness and reduces the risk of null pointer dereferencing.
  
- **Enhanced Parameter Handling:**
  - Method calls now handle arguments more clearly and explicitly, facilitating better understanding and reducing the likelihood of errors during usage.
  
- **Preserved Existing Functionality:**
  - All existing functionality and utility methods have been retained to ensure that the contract interface remains fully functional for current implementations.
  
- **Increased Code Clarity:**
  - Comprehensive comments have been added throughout the code to improve clarity, making it easier for future developers to understand the purpose and functionality of various methods.

### Motivation

The primary motivation for these enhancements is to refine the usability of the `ContractInterface` class while ensuring that it continues to work seamlessly with existing dependencies. By making these adjustments, we aim to:

- **Reduce Complexity:** Simplifying method signatures makes the interface easier to use and less prone to misuse.
- **Enhance Maintainability:** Clearer code with detailed comments allows for easier maintenance and onboarding of new contributors.
- **Ensure Compatibility:** The changes were made with a focus on preserving the current behavior of the interface, ensuring that existing tests and applications using this class remain unaffected.


### Conclusion

This PR aims to provide a clearer, more robust interface for developers interacting with the `ContractInterface` class, ultimately contributing to the overall quality and maintainability of the codebase. Thank you for your consideration of these enhancements!
