Hi @mRcOol7, we appreciate your effort, but it seems your PR doesnâ€™t provide any significant improvements. It mainly adds comments and reorganizes existing content. Did you use an LLM to create it?

So I will be closing this PR, if you disagree, please feel free to reopen it and clarify what exactly you are suggesting as improvement besides the comments that you added. Please do not open another PR with same content. Also, I closed your previous PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15496 for similar reasons.
