# [\#15505 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15505) `merged`: Compiler stack: Protect loadGeneratedIR from contracts that cannot be deployed
**Labels**: `:yellow_circle:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1685266?v=4" width="50">[clonker](https://github.com/clonker) opened issue at [2024-10-11 13:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15505):

If a contract is not deployable (ie interface / abstract), no `yulIR` will be generated. This causes the object parser to error out in `loadGeneratedIR`, as it expects `object {}` as a bare minimum, but gets an empty string instead.

I would also add a test case like:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.0;

abstract contract C {
	function f() public virtual returns (string memory);
}
```
and 
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.0;

interface I {
	function f() external returns (string memory);
}
```

Could be similar to our current ast ir command-line test (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e8b5ca83f37b6a126db6a0a1dcfa00decff63647/test/cmdlineTests/ast_ir/args). And also one, or more, for standard Json output (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/e8b5ca83f37b6a126db6a0a1dcfa00decff63647/test/cmdlineTests/standard_ir_ast_requested/input.json):

```json
{
	"language": "Solidity",
	"sources":
	{
		"C":
		{
			"content": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0\npragma solidity >=0.0; abstract contract C {}"
		}
	},
	"settings": {
		"optimizer": {
			"enabled": true,
			"details": {
				"yul": true
			}
		},
		"viaIR": true,
		"outputSelection": {
			"*": {
				"*": ["irAst", "irOptimizedAst", "yulCFGJson"]
			}
		}
	}

}
```

This should probably also get a bugfix changelog entry. A bit annoying that this is in the release now, but I guess people rarely use these json artifacts anyways - might be a good indicator for how much they're used in the wild actually (since if they're used, people will quickly run into this I guess)
