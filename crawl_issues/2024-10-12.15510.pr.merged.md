Part of #15435/#15464.

This should help _fix_ a minor issue in `test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp`. Here the type `u512` is defined with `MaxBits` greater than `MinBits`. This does not cause any error since boost use the max of `MaxBits` and MinBits` for `void` allocator. Though it should be fixed to avoid confusion.

The reference for the types is here https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/libs/multiprecision/doc/html/boost_multiprecision/tut/ints/cpp_int.html

Oh, I assumed it wasn't because github did not show the button to update the PR. But I guess it makes sense. The branch was technically up to date.
