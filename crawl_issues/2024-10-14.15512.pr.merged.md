If you want, some of the things mentioned above ther could potentially be put in a separate PR(s) to make this one smaller:
- Disabling `datasize()`, `dataoffset()`, `datacopy()`, `setimmutable()`, `loadimmutable()` on EOF (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15512#discussion_r1809294208).
- Adding `ControlFlowSideEffects` to `createFunction()` (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15512#discussion_r1809364632)
- Making the name of the current object available in `AsmAnalyzer` (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15512#discussion_r1809315347).

It doesn't build now because we have to merge two dependencies first.
