## Description
CMake Warning at cmake/FindZ3.cmake:33 (message):
  Could not determine the version of z3, since the z3 executable was not
  found.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:95 (find_package)


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:99 (message):
  SMTChecker tests require Z3 4.12.1 for all tests to pass.

  Build with -DSTRICT_Z3_VERSION=OFF if you want to use a different version.
  You can also use -DUSE_Z3=OFF to build without Z3.  In both cases use
  --no-smt when running tests.

Hey @hongyu-gui!

The report above does not include enough information for us to diagnose whether it is indeed a bug or not. Please provide a more detailed self-contained reproduction of the code causing the issue so that we can figure out what could be wrong.

I would also recommend using text for the code snippets instead of a screenshot as that would help us copy and paste the snippet easily.

And lastly, please note that once https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15252 is merged, it could provide grounds for closing this issue.
