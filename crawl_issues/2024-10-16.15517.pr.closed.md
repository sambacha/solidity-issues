I think this is a misunderstanding.
The text in the docs shows a problematic use of calling a function from a base by explicitly specifying the contract (`Base2.emitEvent`). In this case, the contract `Base1` in the inheritance hierarchy is skipped and the resulting sequence of events will not contain `Base1Emitted`.
After that, the text then presents the proper way of avoiding the problem, by using `super` instead, which then calls the function on the next base contract and so on and so forth. Now, `Final` will call  `Base2` which in turn will call `Base1` that was missing on the previous example.
That's the reason the text says that `it will call Base1.emitEvent()`. Because, now `super` ensures that the inheritance hierarchy is properly followed instead of having the direct call to `Base2` bypass the call to `Base1`.
