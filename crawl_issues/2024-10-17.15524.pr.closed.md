This PR introduces a new feature to the Solidity compiler that provides real-time gas usage estimation and optimization tips for contract functions during compilation. The goal is to help developers identify potential inefficiencies in their smart contracts and make improvements to reduce gas consumption.

Key Changes:
GasUsageAnalyzer: A new class that estimates the gas usage of individual functions based on the operations they perform (e.g., storage access, loops). It provides optimization suggestions when the gas estimate exceeds a certain threshold.
Function Analysis Integration: Modified the function analysis process to invoke the GasUsageAnalyzer after analyzing each function. If the estimated gas cost is high, a warning is displayed with recommendations for optimization.
Build System Update: Included the new GasUsageAnalyzer.cpp file in the build process to ensure the gas analysis feature is part of the compiled Solidity compiler.

Benefits:
Developer Efficiency: Helps developers optimize their contracts by identifying high-gas-consuming functions early in the development process.
Real-Time Feedback: Warnings and optimization suggestions are provided during compilation, reducing the need for external gas estimation tools.
Improved Gas Efficiency: Developers can refine their code to minimize gas costs, making their contracts more efficient and cost-effective to deploy and interact with.

The PR makes no sense. It adds a random .cpp file in the root dir that's not connected to anything and does not look like it would even compile if it were. The implementation is just a few `if`s with random values. This is completely made up. Is this AI-generated or something?
