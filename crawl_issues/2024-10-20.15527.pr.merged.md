Some test files in tests/libyul have a .sol file extension but are invalid Solidity code. Rename them to .yul.

Command used:
```bash
for f in $(fd -e sol . test/libyul); do mv $f $(basename $f .sol).yul; done
```

WTF, this moves the test files to repo root. Why was this even merged?

No worries, I opened a PR to move the tests back to appropriate dirs.
