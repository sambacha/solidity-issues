Reference: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15483#issue-2569938575. I found an awkward scenario in using calldata struct/array in function bodies. Daniel pointed out (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15483#issuecomment-2396781091) that this is a workaround to allow complex initialization patterns but may not be well documented. This pr is for enriching the doc to mitigate users' confusion.

@ekpyron Hi Daniel, would you mind helping review this pr? thx

We discussed this a bit more internally in response to your issue (and also https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/14021 and the fact that this also came up in the Solidity underhanded contest) and concluded that we will start emitting a warning for this pattern (and with the next breaking release disallow it entirely).

Originally, when this pattern was allowed for allowing complex initialization patterns, we did not yet have assembly access to storage or calldata pointers. While discussing this again, we realized that today, complex initialization patterns can also be allowed by an even more explicit and conscious
```
    S calldata s;
    assembly { s.offset := 0 }
    ... complex initialization pattern ...
```
(or similarly in the storage case)
```
    S storage s;
    assembly { s.slot := 0 }
    ... complex initialization pattern ...
```
which makes it absolutely clear what happens at the user's peril.

We can't emit an error for the ``s = s;`` pattern right away, since people may still use it as a workaround, but we'll warn about it and stage it for becoming an error in the future.

I'd still be fine with merging this as docs improvement for now, but wanted to make it clear that this will become obsolete again soon.

No problem. When the error handling is done, you can let me know and I will remove this doc. This update is only useful for a while.

> I think this is good now. But we should rebase and squash the commits. Can you do that please, @haoyang9804 ?

Done. Seems that all redundant commits have been rebased into one.

@haoyang9804 , can you rebase on top of latest develop branch instead of merge, please?

@matheusaaguiar The rebasing is done and all checks have passed. plz take a look.
