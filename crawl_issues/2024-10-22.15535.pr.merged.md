I'd merge this one already, but apparently github has not noticed that [CI passed after I reran it](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/36664/workflows/88f74e61-bd34-4834-9f54-92d31bf68863). Maybe try force pushing it to retrigger the checks (after amending it without changes just to alter the commit hash and make it look like a new one).
