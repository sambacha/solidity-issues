Can you rebase it to make it independent of #15535? It will have to rebased that way to be merged anyway. And it's easier to review that way too.

Because of an issue with mixing data and object names in one set I implemented in a separated commit a change which separates these two name sets. This allows to properly report an error when trying to use Data instead of Object name in `eofcreate` or `returncontract` buildins.

BTW, many of the problems we had here, like `m_objectName` not getting initialized or the source location not being present in test output would normally have been detected in CI by the test suite. We should really add a run with EOF enabled in [`soltest_all.sh`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/soltest_all.sh) (in a separate PR). Not all tests will pass yet (especially not semantic tests), but we could whitelist only the suites known to work, like `yulSyntaxTests` and `objectCompilerTests`.

I would do it too. Even started looking on `solltest_all.sh` but now idea where this should be added. Can someone assist with this?

I guess I can add it myself. Probably better to keep you focused on the actual EOF bits anyway.

PR that adds an EOF pass: #15552.

> This is fine now in terms of correctness.

> I still have some small nitpicks. Just some wording tweaks and also parts of what I suggested in [#15536 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15536#discussion_r1817002987). But I don't want to add another round just for those so I did them myself and pushed 3 commits to the [`object-name-to-analysis` branch](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/object-name-to-analysis). So just pull them in (all or some of them; I separated the rename so that it can be easily dropped if you don't like it) squash and then we can merge this.

Ok. thanks. I understood from the comment that it's fine finally. But yest your wording is better.
