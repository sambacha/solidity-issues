# [\#15540 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15540) `open`: Yul object names with dots are accepted but ambiguous
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `low effort`, `low impact`, `must have eventually`

## Description

An identifier like `A.B.C` is a valid name for a Yul object. However, the compiler also uses dots as separators in qualified object/data names. This creates ambiguity when names with dots are passed to builtins like `dataoffset()` or `datasize()`.

Such names are interpreted as paths by some parts of the compiler and as names by other parts. This results in errors or ICEs unless both possibilities are defined. And when both are defined, it's possible that some checks are getting bypassed.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28

## Steps to Reproduce

### Unreferenced object
`unreferenced.yul`
```yul
object "A.B.C" {
    code {}
}
```
```bash
solc --strict-assembly unreferenced.yul --asm --debug-info none
```
```
======= unreferenced.yul (EVM) =======

Text representation:
  stop
```

Dots in names are accepted and apparently cause no issue on their own.

### Top-level subobject
`top-level.yul`:
```yul
object "X" {
    code {
        sstore(0, datasize("A.B"))
    }

    data "A.B" hex"11223344556677"
}
```
```bash
solc --strict-assembly top-level.yul --asm
```
```
Error: Unknown data object "A.B".
 --> top-level.yul:3:28:
  |
3 |         sstore(0, datasize("A.B"))
  |                            ^^^^^
```

The error is coming from Yul analysis, which means that it treats it as a path and expects a nested subobject.

### Nested subobject
`nested.yul`:
```yul
object "X" {
    code {
        sstore(0, datasize("A.B"))
    }

    object "A" {
        code {}

        data "B" hex"112233"
    }
}
```
```bash
solc --strict-assembly nested.yul --asm
```
```
======= nested.yul (EVM) =======
Uncaught exception:
/solidity/libyul/Object.cpp(155): Throw in function std::vector<long unsigned int> solidity::yul::Object::pathToSubObject(solidity::yul::YulString) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Assembly object <A.B> not found or does not contain code.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Assembly object <A.B> not found or does not contain code.
```

This one probably passes Yul analysis but then fails later at a place that interprets the path differently.

### Ambiguous subobject
`ambiguous.yul`:
```yul
object "X" {
    code {
        sstore(0, datasize("A.B"))
    }

    data "A.B" hex"11223344556677"

    object "A" {
        code {}

        data "B" hex"112233"
    }
}
```
```bash
solc --strict-assembly ambiguous.yul --asm --debug-info none
```
```
======= ambiguous.yul (EVM) =======

Text representation:
  0x07
  0x00
  sstore

data_c304e60a0d3af7489b64bc5b186db2aed0df052c89a05935e0731015cd85d049 11223344556677

sub_0: assembly {
      stop
    stop

}
```

Note the `0x07` - when assembling we're apparently choosing the top-level `data`, again different from analysis.

Decision from the call today: we're going to disallow dots in names and we don't consider it breaking. Such names don't seem to work properly outside of weird corner cases anyway and any code broken by it can be trivially converted into working code by just removing the dots. It also only affects Yul - the Solidity compiler never generates object names with dots by itself.

@cameel Hello, I hope you're doing well. I noticed that this issue has a "low effort" label, and I would be interested in contributing. Is there a possibility that I could help with something?

I'm just starting to study Solidity, and I created a repo to track my progress: https://github.com/salvadormartin3z/Learn-Solidity any recommendations are welcome. 

I hope we can connect.
