I have a question about [EIP-6206](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6206). It says:

> As long as `JUMPF` prepares the delta `type[current_section_index].outputs - type[target_section_index].outputs` stack elements before changing code sections, it is possible to jump to a section with less outputs than was originally entered via `CALLF`.

How does this work exactly? What does "prepares" mean here? Does this mean that `JUMPF` will push some extra stack items when you jump to a function with fewer outputs to make up the difference? The "Execution semantics" section seems to contradict that:

> 5. `JUMPF` neither pops nor pushes anything to the operand stack.

But then who pushes the extra items?

"`JUMPF` prepares" is maybe an unfortunate mental shortcut. Instruction `JUMPF` by itself neither pops nor pushes anything to the operand stack. This should say instead sth like: "as long as execution of the section up to the point of JUMPF prepares the delta stack elements before changing code sections...". I think about this like this:

JUMPF in a returning section is somewhat like a RETF. Some of the outputs of that section are "coming" from the JUMPF's target (`type[target_section_index].outputs`), while some (that "delta") can already be present on the stack at the moment of JUMPF (`type[current_section_index].outputs - type[target_section_index].outputs`). Together, they make up the `type[current_section_index].outputs`, as expected.

Sorry about the confusion, we'll fix the wording to not be ambiguous on that matter.

@cameel pls take a look at https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9055/commits/f344ef8691e6b2461e601e656638384dcb8e9bee and let us know if that is better.

@pdobacz Thanks, this makes things clearer. The previous wording sounded as if it was `JUMPF` doing something special with those extra items, but I see now that it's just the code leading up to it that's expected to push them to the stack.

 The new text sounds fine. It could still say "prepares" though. The issue was really in saying who does that.
