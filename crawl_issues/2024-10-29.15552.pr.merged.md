**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `EOF`

We already have some tests for EOF, but the whole test suite doesn't pass yet, so we were not running them in CI. This often results in failing tests not being noticed in EOF PRs.

This PR adds a soltest pass with `--eof-version 1` in CI but with a temporary blacklist for tests that are not expected to pass yet.

Note that syntax and semantic tests are not blacklisted. They all pass because for them (and any other tests based on `EVMVersionRestrictedTestCase`) EOF is excluded unless explicitly requested via `EOFVersion: >=EOFv1` setting. This will allow us to enable them on a case-by-case basis for now and only when all of them are ready we'll flip the default to include EOF.

> LGTM, but have you tested with EOF version 1?

Oh, my mistake, I see it in the `EOF_VERSIONS` array.

Yeah, it's now running for EOF v1 too. That was the whole point of the PR :)
