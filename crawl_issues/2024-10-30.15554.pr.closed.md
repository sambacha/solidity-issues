We recently encountered errors while updating Z3 and CVC5 in the buildpack images for https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15551.

See the build logs here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/actions/runs/11575096134/job/32220871629?pr=15551 and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/actions/runs/11575096134/job/32220870627?pr=15551

This PR aims to address these issues by temporarily marking the submodules directory as a `safe.directory` before attempting to initialize it.

Unfortunately, the `safe.directory` configuration is only available globally and cannot be applied locally, which is why I did the change in this way since now our submodule dependencies are managed by CMake, do you have any suggestions for a better solution?

There seems to be a difference in behaviour across different `git` versions.
The builds are failing for `git 2.25.1`, but are succeeding for `git 2.43.0`.

Indeed. Just found this here: https://github.blog/open-source/git/highlights-from-git-2-36/#stricter-repository-ownership-checks

```txt
Beginning in Git 2.35.2, Git changed its default behavior to prevent you from executing git commands
in a repository owned by a different user than the current one. This is designed to prevent git invocations
from unintentionally executing commands which the repository owner configured.
```

Maybe we could apply such configs in the [build.sh](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/ci/build.sh) script for each submodule before calling cmake. I believe those scripts will only be used by CI anyway. Would that be better?

Another way would be just to ensure to use the same user when creating the docker image and when running the build insider the container, no?

Why not just do the ``git config`` in the Dockerfile? Otherwise: yes, adjusting things, s.t. the user/permissions just match would be the most proper solution I guess. (And I agree that we definitely shouldn't do any of this in "user"-facing cmake config or scripts)
