**Labels**: `optimizer`

Discovered in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15535#discussion_r1813296743.

The PR replaces hard-coded side-effects with a helper that ensures they're identical with those of the `DATACOPY` instruction, which the builtin uses internally.

The discrepancy was introduced in a refactor (#9283) and appears to have been a mistake.

Fortunately it had no user-visible effects. The only place where the flag is used is the `LoopInvariantCodeMotion` optimizer step, via `SideEffectsCollector::movableRelativeTo()`: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b5b8084f58cbc1663701045ce920cad01ae9154a/libyul/optimiser/Semantics.h#L77-L84

Since `m_sideEffects.memory == SideEffects::Write` makes the condition true anyway, the value of this flag does not actually matter for this instruction.
