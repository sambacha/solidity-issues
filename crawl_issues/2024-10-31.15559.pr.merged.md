Does this really depend on #15555? From a brief initial look it seems to me that they should be independent.

No. It does not.

I think it would be good to enable a few related semantic tests already in this PR. Some external calls and the low-level calls on `address`. Otherwise we have zero coverage for the codegen changes here and you will have to deal with them all at once when we enable all semantic tests.

Also, a question about the [EOF spec](https://github.com/ipsilon/eof/blob/main/spec/eof.md). It says:

> **NOTE**: The replacement instructions `EXT*CALL` continue being treated as **undefined** in legacy code.

Does it simply mean that the opcodes are treated as `INVALID` on legacy? Isn't this the case for all newly introduced opcodes? I have an impression that there might be more to this than that because otherwise why call out specifically `EXT*CALL`?

Test are failing because they depend on other PR with stack height calculation. I can regenerate them but I would rather wait until it's merged.

I have already a version with all semantic tests passing. It required three small fixes but in this case I would not bother now. Moreover we need to introduce Osaka to Solidity to run semantic tests with the newest evmone now.

It's the same as with all other newly introduced opcodes.

Original plan was to enable them also for legacy, then it changed, and this explicit note added to point out the change.

Ah, ok. I guess that may have been the reason for making it a dependency?

In any case that PR is merged now.

> The main remaining thing is [#15559 (comment)](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15559#discussion_r1873660414), which I missed previously. I.e. `extcall` opcodes must not be reserved identifiers on legacy + a test confirming it works correctly by defining a function/variable with that name.

> The same thing needs to be fixed for other opcodes, but that should be done separately, since that's already broken on `develop`.

I enabled one but to be able to run any semantic test we need to first merge this https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15626 or https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15606
