## Description

```solidity
function f(mapping(uint128 => S) storage s) internal pure returns (mapping(uint128 => S) storage s2) {
        s2 = s;  // pass the compilation
        s = s2; // TypeError: Types in storage containing (nested) mappings cannot be assigned to.
    } 
```
`s` and `s2` are both mapping-type declarations in function `f`. But the assignments to them cause different results.
Perhaps this is an intentional behavior, but the error message is misleading. It implies the assignment to `s2` should also be forbidden. 

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28
