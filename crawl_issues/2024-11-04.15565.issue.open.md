<!--## Prerequisites

    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

The following test program causes a `Member "func27" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in contract contract19.`

```solidity
contract contract19 {
  mapping(int64 => mapping(int64 => int64)) internal mapping37;
  function func26() external view {
    this.func27(mapping37);
  }
  function func27(mapping(int64 => mapping(int64 => int64)) memory mapping28) external view {

  }
}
```
The following test program switches the order of `func26` and `func27`, and it triggers `Types containing (nested) mappings can only be parameters or return variables of internal or library functions.`
```solidity
contract contract19 {
  mapping(int64 => mapping(int64 => int64)) internal mapping37;
  function func27(mapping(int64 => mapping(int64 => int64)) memory mapping28) external view {

  }
  function func26() external view {
    this.func27(mapping37);
  }
}
```
I think the second error message is correct.
