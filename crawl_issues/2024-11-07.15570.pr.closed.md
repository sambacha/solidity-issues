Added an additional require call to the vote function to check if the proposal number is valid. That problem with the function doesn't seem intentional because it isn't present in the "Possible Improvements" section.

There is a comment a few lines below explaining why an explicit check wasn't added:

> ```solidity
>             // If `proposal` is out of the range of the array,
>             // this will throw automatically and revert all
>             // changes.
> ```
