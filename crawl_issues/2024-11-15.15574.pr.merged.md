# [\#15574 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15574) `merged`: Yul: Avoid expensive operations in functions called very often
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-11-15 02:21](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15574):

Two changes are proposed here:

1. Do not include expensive assertion check in the equality operator.
2. Avoid expansive regex match (`std::regex`) whenever possible.

Add 1: The equality comparison is called very often in `CommonSubexpressionEliminator`, presumably because it is the comparison operator used for the map `CommonSubexpressionEliminator::m_replacementCandidates`. The method `validLiteral` is nontrivial and should not be called (twice!) on every call to the equality comparison.
It might be desirable to re-introduce the check in a more suitable place.

Add 2: Method `Parser::fetchDebugDataFromComment` was matching against a regex, but most of the time it was trying to match against an empty string. `std::regex` is known to be extremely slow. This would not be such a problem if this method was not called after every parsed token, see `Parser::advance`.
I believe even better solution would be to move the call to `fetchDebugDataFromComment` to a more appropriate place; my intuition says it is currently misplaced.

Benchmarking on my local laptop shows consistent improvement on external benchmarks:

I don't have benchmarking results for the changes separately, although I could compute them if necessary.
Regarding the first point: We discussed this with @cameel. `assert` is called only in Debug mode. In Release mode, the macro results in no-op, so the calls to `validLiteral` disappear. `yulAssert` is always called. So with the proposed change we still get the sanity checks in Debug mode, but in Release mode, that is, in production, the compiler will no longer suffer from the performance penalty.

Oh, this almost suggests we should revert the second commit.
And I am buffled how the first commit could have made sablier-v2-1.2.0 on legacy slower, because we are just removing an operation. Moreover on a code path that is not executed in legacy mode, no? That seems to be a fluke?

Probably a fluke given what's in the PR. I would not expect it slow anything down so I'd not worry too much about it. The differences are still just a few percent. Unfortunately these numbers are not consistent enough to evaluate very small differences with a single run (at least on my hardware, @clonker seems to be getting better results). Running them multiple times and averaging helps.
