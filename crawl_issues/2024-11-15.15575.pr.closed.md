Hi guys, based on the discussion at the Solidity booth at Devcon, I suggest adding Wake to the resources documentation.

Also I would suggest remove/replace some items, it can be done either in this PR or another one.

- Brownie is no longer maintained and could be replaced by Ape (https://github.com/ApeWorX/ape)
- Truffle can also be removed :'(
- The remix vscode extension is also deprecated


Let me know if I should also put commit for these ones
