# [\#15578 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15578) `merged`: More precise documentation of optimizer settings and their defaults
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `optimizer`

When reading these docs I always need a few takes to understand what the defaults actually are and how the settings interact with each other. They're imprecise and confusing. Trying to answer #15576 today it annoyed me enough that I decided to rewrite it, not to have to waste time on decoding them ever again.

Examples:
- `If "details" is given, "enabled" can be omitted.` at first sounds as if including `details` was equivalent to turning on `enabled`. But it actually means that `enabled` becomes redundant because it only provides defaults.
- `The inliner is always off if no details are given,` - not true, it is on when the optimizer is enabled.

The PR also fixes the docstrings in `OptimiserSettings.h` which somehow switched places.
