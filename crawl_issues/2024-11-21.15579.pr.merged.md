# [\#15579 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15579) `merged`: AST: More efficient way to collect referenced source units
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2024-11-21 06:30](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15579):

Previous implementation of the method SourceUnit::referencedSourceUnits contained a subtle performance bug. Because the skip list was passed by value into the recursive call, the dependency graph of the imports were effectively traversed as if expanded into a full tree, instead of as a DAG (directed acyclic graph).

An example to illustrate that previously the same source was visited more than once: Suppose `A.sol` imports `B.sol` and `C.sol` and both of these import `D.sol`. Previosuly, the method would process `A` by first recursing into `B` and then `C`. When processing `B`, the source `D` is processed and then added to the skip list. When the recursion returns from processing `B`, any changes made to the skip list there were discarded, so that during processing `C`, the source `D` is not find in the skip list and processed again.

Now, in most cases the import/dependency graph is probably shallow or does not contain such diamond-like subgraphs, and the performance is not affected.
However, for a deeper dependency graph with multiple layers of diamond-like subgraphs this quickly leads to very bad performance, because every source unit is visited a number of times equal to the number of paths by which the source unit is reachable from the root source unit.

This change seems to shave off *tens* of seconds on **both** legacy and ir pipeline for `sablier-v2-1.2.0` project.

There is a big difference for `sablier-v2-1.2.0` on both `legacy` and `ir`. Other projects do not seem to be affected.

What is the error you're getting there (you can see the content of stderr when the script finishes)? For me these two pass without errors.

`MockContract.sol` imports `@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Proxy.sol`, which for this older Uniswap version still had to be installed via npm. The errors look as if it either does not get installed or a wrong version gets installed. Check what you have in `uniswap-v4-2022-06-16/node_modules/@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Proxy.sol`. Maybe `external-setup.sh` needs an adjustment. Or maybe you do not have npm?

Though in the end this particular project is not that relevant here (it was mostly useful for benchmarking across a wide range of solc versions) so it's fine to also ignore it if you don't want to dig into it.

The relative difference for sablier is much smaller but it's still there, so there must be something to it.

Also, the huge discrepancy in memory usage is interesting. Apparently sablier uses 15 GB on my machine, which I'd normally ascribe to the recent bump to 1.2 but for you it's much smaller - I wonder how that's possible? And the difference for `uniswap-v4-2024-06-06` is also quite big.

I will check if I can fix this on my end. Thanks for the pointers!

The memory usage for uniswap in my data is irrelevant, because it ends prematurely with an error.
For sablier, I would say the memory usage reported by the script is inaccurate. When I was monitoring the process live, it was definitely using up to 12GB. Maybe this has something to do how the gnu time command behaves on MacOS.

Regarding the times, indeed for you the difference in `sabier` via `ir` is much smaller, but it is visible, and for `legacy` it is comparable to mine. Also, for you, `eigenlayer` also shows some improvement, so that's good.

The 2024 one does not.

You are right, I missed that! I don't have an answer for that.
