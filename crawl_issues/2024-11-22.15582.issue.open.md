## Description

Here are 2 standard JSON input files:
[input1.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17870239/input1.json)
[input2.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17870241/input2.json)

The only difference between them is that in the second file output selection for `src/PoolManager.sol` is not specified:
```diff
802,810d801
<             "src/PoolManager.sol": {
<                 "*": [
<                     "abi",
<                     "evm.bytecode",
<                     "evm.deployedBytecode",
<                     "evm.methodIdentifiers",
<                     "metadata"
<                 ]
<             },
```

However, compilation for the second input fails while it succeeds for the first

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.26
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: MacOS
