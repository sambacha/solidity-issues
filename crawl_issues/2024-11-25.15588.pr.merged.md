## Description  
This pull request addresses two issues:  

1. **Styling Fix in `custom.css`**  
   - Corrected the `box-shadow` property for the `.wy-side-nav-search` class to ensure proper CSS syntax by adding the missing `px` units.  [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow)

2. **Documentation Typo Fix in `contributing.rst`**  
   - Corrected a typo: changed "requry" to "require" for improved clarity and correctness.
