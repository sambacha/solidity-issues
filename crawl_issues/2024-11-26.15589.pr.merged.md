# [\#15589 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15589) `merged`: Update python in CI to get latest codespell
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`, `:yellow_circle:`

I'm finding a lot of typos in PRs like #15550 even though we have a codespell job that should be detecting them automatically. Apparently this is because we're using `cimg/python:3.6` image, which ships an old version of codespell (2.2.1). The latest one has a better dictionary that does detect the typos.

This PR replaces `cimg/python:3.6` with our Ubuntu image, which we keep up to date.

It also adds a config file for codespell to make it easier to run it locally with the right arguments. It's now enough to simply run `codespell` without arguments.
