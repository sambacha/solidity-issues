This PR fixes minor typos in the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file:

1. Changed "making participation" to "make participation" to correct the verb tense.
2. Corrected "address" to "addresses" to match the plural form.

**Why is this important?**
These changes improve the clarity and grammatical accuracy of the document. Proper grammar ensures the Code of Conduct is professional and easier to understand, promoting a more inclusive environment for all contributors and maintainers.

No functional changes, only documentation improvements.
