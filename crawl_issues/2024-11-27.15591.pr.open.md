**Description:**

In the section about "Salted contract creations / create2," I've updated the term "create2" to "CREATE2" to match Solidity's official usage. In Solidity, "CREATE2" is a special opcode and keyword, and it's important to maintain consistency with its proper formatting, which uses uppercase letters. This change ensures clarity and aligns the documentation with the correct conventions, making it easier for developers to follow and preventing any confusion when referring to this specific keyword.
