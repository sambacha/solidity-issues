## Abstract

From a consumer application perspective, it's quite valuable to know if a function return value can change.
With the current stateMutability on the abi, we can know that a function is pure https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#json and therefore, function results are deterministic & not chain state dependent.

For `immutable` this information gets lost on the abi though as immutable getters are not considered pure, and views accessing immutables cannot be pure.

I see there have been various discussions about narrowing or widening the definition of `pure`,  but all being eventually closed without a resolution of the problem:
- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8153
- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12829
(i think these are the most recent ones)

Therefore i'm wondering if it would make sense to extend the abi spec https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#json to include some type of state mutability field on the outputs.

## Motivation

For various applications, it's helpful to know if a return value is constant or not.

## Specification

Sorry didn't think to much about this yet.

## Backwards Compatibility

As this would be an addition to the abi spec, I assume backwards compatibility should not be a problem.

## Alternatives

In one of the discussions i read on the topic it was suggested to introduce a new type of state mutability between immutable & view, which i guess would solve the same problem.

closing in favor of #15096 (which i think was closed unintentionally)
