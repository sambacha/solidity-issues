# [\#15596 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15596) `merged`: Replace `InvalidDeposit` and `InvalidOpcode` exceptions with asserts
**Labels**: `refactor`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-11-29 01:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15596):

A bit of simplification of our error handling in bytecode generation. We have dedicated exceptions defined for some cases but they're almost never caught and are de facto equivalent with failed assertions. The only case where we catch one of them is assembly import.

The PR replaces them with proper asserts (and `AssemblyImportException` in the one case where we do catch them).
