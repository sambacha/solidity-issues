# [\#15597 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15597) `open`: Fix silent value truncation in assembly import

While doing #15596 I noticed that the validation against using PUSH with more than 32 bytes does not get triggered in assembly import. Turns out that this is because the import code blindly converts the `value` field to `u256`, truncating it if it's too long. This happens for several other assembly item types as well.

Validations for assembly import are generally a mess, but the PR does not attempt to clean that up. It only adds rough checks that should be enough to disallow cases affected by the truncation bug.
