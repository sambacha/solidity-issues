# [\#15610 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15610) `merged`: Fix code generation error reporting in Yul

~Depends on #15624.~ Merged.

Currently `CodeGenerationError` thrown when assembling is only properly handled when compiling Solidity. In pure Yul mode we get an ICE instead:

```
Internal exception in StandardCompiler::compile: Throw location unknown (consider using BOOST_THROW_EXCEPTION)
Dynamic exception type: solidity::langutil::Error
std::exception::what: Some immutables were read from but never assigned, possibly because of optimization.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Some immutables were read from but never assigned, possibly because of optimization.
```

The reason is that we catch those errors only in `CompilerStack`. This should be done in `YulStack` as well.

I extracted large part of the PR into #15624, because it's really a separate fix. The part that is left here is just the fix for `CodeGenerationError` not being caught in `YulStack`.
