Depends on #15610.

Just a test refactor in preparation for another PR.

Currently most Yul test suites use the `yul::test::parse()` helper, which has two overloads which do things in wildly inconsistent ways. One uses `YulStack` but assumes no errors and reports only the top-level AST. The other manually runs `ObjectParser` and does return errors and the whole `Object` but only runs analysis on the top-level AST ignoring the others.

On top of that neither of them really suits my needs, because they don't allow continuing the compilation after parsing. The PR replaces them with a new, more flexible, helper that returns `YulStack` instead. Then makes all test suites use it.

Also:
- Most suites do accept complete Yul objects thanks to these helpers but then proceed to silently ignore any sub-objects. I made them report an unimplemented feature instead.
- Many suites do not actually print Yul compilation errors and just say that compilation failed since they're not testing the parser and assume correctness of input files. I added a helper for easy reporting of errors and made all suites consistently use it (except for those doing Boost tests).
- I made all the suites assume the EVM dialect. We still technically have a `dialect` setting but there's only one dialect and passing it to `YulStack` is a bit of a hassle so not having to do that simplifies things a lot.
