Depends on #15611.

The PR makes it possible to create Yul syntax tests that cover code generation errors. We only had one such error until now (access to an uninitialized immutable), but with EOF they will be much more common due to the limits imposed by the format that cannot be checked before bytecode generation. Treating those as ICEs is not acceptable. They must be properly reported to the user as errors and also covered with tests.

In this PR I'm making Yul syntax tests not stop after parsing but actually proceed with optimization and assembling. We already do the same thing in Solidity syntax tests.

The PR then adds code generation errors and tests for two EOF cases to make sure the new mechanism works properly.
