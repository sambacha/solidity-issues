<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

Certain `evm.*.*` output is generated in memory even when not requested through `outputSelection`. This wastes resources on computing values that are discarded immediately after.

In Foundry, we updated the `outputSelection` to only include specific fields of `evm.bytecode.*` as we don't make use of all of them, which was a substantial win in compilation times: https://github.com/foundry-rs/compilers/pull/231. The biggest contributor to this was excluding `generatedSources` from the JSON, as these can become very large.

The default output selection is now: 
```json
["abi","evm.bytecode.object","evm.bytecode.sourceMap","evm.bytecode.linkReferences","evm.deployedBytecode.object","evm.deployedBytecode.sourceMap","evm.deployedBytecode.linkReferences","evm.deployedBytecode.immutableReferences","evm.methodIdentifiers","metadata"]
```

However, I profiled the compiler and noticed that it was still calling `generatedSources`.

Here's a profile generated from `forge build --use <solc 0.8.29-develop.2024.10.22+commit.9c4995a9.mod.Linux.g++>` on [superform-xyz/superform-core](https://github.com/superform-xyz/superform-core) @ 7b69077 (this is an older build of solc but it should still apply): https://share.firefox.dev/3BaYnLD, using [samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply)

You can see that there is a 4% frame of `CompilerStack::generatedSources`.

I believe this happens in `StandardCompiler`. It is generated and passed eagerly to `collectEVMObject` when any `evm.bytecode*` output is requested https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/8da621c41d67d8ee5a74157f28efa670a7370746/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L1509-L1522

but then discarded if the individual `evm.bytecode.generatedSources` is not requested https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/8da621c41d67d8ee5a74157f28efa670a7370746/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L399-L400

The same applies to other fields, like `sourceMap`.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28, main
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Paris
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Foundry
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Foundry
- Operating system: Linux

## Steps to Reproduce

Compile anything with `evm.bytecode.object` output selection, see above.

Good find! #15460 solved part of the problem at `CompilerStack` level but I did not notice that `StandardCompiler` was also eagerly requesting it rather than doing it only when the output is there. Fixing this should shave off a bit more from the compilation time.
