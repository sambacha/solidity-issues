The ability to execute all semantic tests requires an update to [evmone 0.13.0](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone/releases/tag/v0.13.0).

While at it, we should also add `Osaka` as a valid EVM version and move all the currently implemented EOF functionality to it to match evmone/evmc.

Small correction: I just realized that we're already on the latest EVMC v12 (#15320). It's evmone that we need to update here.

@roqs are you still doing this or could I take a shot at it? I've read the past PRs involving updating evmone versions and I think I get the idea. Looks like there's just a handful of changes to be made in `scripts/install_evmone.ps1` , `scripts/install_evmone.ps1`, and `test/Common.h`.
