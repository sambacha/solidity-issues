# [\#15624 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15624) `merged`: Don't ignore errors reported after analysis

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-12-07 02:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15624):

Follow-up to #15168.

Originally this was a part of #15610, but I decided to extract it because it's really an issue of its own, even though before #15610 we weren't throwing any errors that could trigger it.

The issue is that CLI and Standard JSON interface don't check for errors after analysis and just happily proceed with assembling. `CompilerStack` also makes the same mistake when using `YulStack` internally. As a result, if an `UnimplementedFeatureError` were to be reported it would be ignored and we'd report empty bytecode, or run into an assertion/segfault in the process.

In addition to that `UnimplementedFeatureError`s caught during parsing were not reported as a parsing failure.
