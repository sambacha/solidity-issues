Fix immutables bug. EOF implementation needs to have `m_immutbalesVariables` and `m_libraryAddressOffset` members of `IRGenerationContext` properly initialized because their values contains offsets to immutables variables values in EOF data section and they are needed when generating `Deployed` container.

Enable one semantic test which failed before the fix

~Depends on #15626~. Merged.
~Depends on #15635~. Merged.

Actually, can you also pull in e14830bf63da5cc9aee2b5e76ed5d7e896ac07e1? That's the only bit from #15606 that's still missing, so if you do that, we can also close it (add `Closes #15606` to the description).

I can pull. I did not do it because it's unrelated change. I wanna also to enable EOF testing by default so this changes won't be needed. Right?

True in the end it's unrelated. It's just so minor that I thought just a separate commit in some EOF PR was enough of a separation and I was more worried about just forgetting it :)

Personally, I'd rather get it in faster, but you're right, enabling EOF by default will ultimately solve the problem as well.

OK. I will add it here. Just not to forget about it later.
