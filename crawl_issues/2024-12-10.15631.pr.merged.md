**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

- Constant Optimizer: Do not assert for shl builtin, it is guarded by `dialect.evmVersion().hasBitwiseShifting()`.
- `EVMCodeTransformTest`s use defaulted evm dialect instead of test-configured one: there was a mismatch between the dialect configured in the test's `YulStack` and what was used in the test's `EVMObjectCompiler`, one using the defaulted (latest) version and one the test-configured one, respectively. Also some of the code generation tests fail for `byzantium` and `homestead` if configured with the same dialect. So for now I have reverted back to default. (@cameel @rodiazet)
