`OptimizedEVMCodeTransform` requires `Assembly` stack height for non-returning function call to be equal to `rets-args`. For EVM `Assembly` for EOF it's calculated based on `CodeSection` inputs and outputs. It means that we need to store number of rets for a code section equal to number of return values based in function declaration. Additional flag `canContinue` is needed to properly generate code section type in EOF container and to decide if we should use JumpF or CallF when creating AssemblyItem for the function call. 

~Depends on #15635~. Merged.
