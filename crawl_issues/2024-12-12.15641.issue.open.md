<!--## Prerequisites
- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.
-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.28
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): None
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): None
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: None
- Operating system: Ubuntu

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command-line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

```solidity
// Some *minimal* Solidity source code to reproduce the bug.
// ...
```
-->

A fairly simple code named a.sol
```solidity
contract SimpleContract {
    uint256 public value;
    constructor(uint256 _initialValue) {
        value = _initialValue;
    }
    function setValue(uint256 _newValue) public {
        value = _newValue;
    }
    function getValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```
The help message shows two points:
1) options "--optimize-yul" and "--no-optimize-yul" are contradictory
2) if "--optimize" is enabled, "--optimize-yul" will be enabled automatically
```bash
Optimizer Options:
  --optimize           Enable optimizer.
  --optimize-runs n (=200)
                       The number of runs specifies roughly how often each 
                       opcode of the deployed code will be executed across the 
                       lifetime of the contract. Lower values will optimize 
                       more for initial deployment cost, higher values will 
                       optimize more for high-frequency usage.
  --optimize-yul       Enable Yul optimizer (independently of the EVM assembly 
                       optimizer). The general --optimize option automatically 
                       enables this unless --no-optimize-yul is specified.
  --no-optimize-yul    Disable Yul optimizer (independently of the EVM assembly
                       optimizer).
  --yul-optimizations steps
                       Forces Yul optimizer to use the specified sequence of 
                       optimization steps instead of the built-in one.
```
I try command
```bash
solc --bin-runtime --optimize-yul --no-optimize-yul ./a.sol
```
and i get
```bash
Error: Options --optimize-yul and --no-optimize-yul cannot be used together.
```
this is consistent with the 1st point
and then i try command
```bash
solc --bin-runtime --optimize --no-optimize-yul ./a.sol
```
the compilation crashes at this time
```bash
Internal compiler error:
/solidity/libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp(1719): Throw in function std::string solidity::frontend::CompilerStack::createMetadata(const solidity::frontend::CompilerStack::Contract&, bool) const
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Solidity assertion failed
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Solidity assertion failed
```
According to the 2nd point, I should get the same or similar error as before, but here it crashes for some reason
