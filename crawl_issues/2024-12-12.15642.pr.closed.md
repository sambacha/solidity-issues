I want to ask in what stage of the compilation or optimization the variables declared in the source code are packed, if any packeting in variable is done

Hey @chamitro!

I will be closing this pull request as questions such as above should only be posted on our Matrix support channels and the forum. I would request you to post this on https://forum.soliditylang.org/.

Additionally, the best practice for external contributors is to _only_ open pull request(s) to suggest changes in the codebase once an existing issue describing/proposing the change has been explicitly assigned to them.
