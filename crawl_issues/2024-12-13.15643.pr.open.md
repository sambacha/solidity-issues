# [\#15643 PR](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15643) `open`: Contract as default location in post-analysis errors

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2024-12-13 20:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/15643):

Partially addresses #12783 and #15139.

This PR uses the current contract as the default location for errors reported after analysis of Solidity code.

Most of these errors currently do not include any location, most likely because it's hard to provide one that would work for both Solidity and Yul compilation. We actually remove location from `CodeGenerationErrors` even if it's present.

Using the contract location is not very precise but it's easy to so and is much better than nothing, especially in a big project containing many contracts.
