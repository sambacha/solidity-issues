# [\#15644 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/15644) `open`: Generating deployed bytecode
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

With geth supporting code overrides in many RPC calls, I would very much like to use them during development as it is much easier for me to test on a life network than dealing with any of the Solidity development frameworks. However, despite multiple attempts, so far I haven't been able to find a way to have solidity generate the deployed bytecode, i.e. the bytecode as it would look on-chain after copying, replacing immutables, running all constructors etc.

Did I overlook something or is this not possible with Solidity at the moment? Are there any other methods people use to generate bytecode for overloading in RPC calls?
