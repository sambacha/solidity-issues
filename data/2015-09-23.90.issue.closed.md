with this: 
string pp = "value1";
The DataLocation is indeed Storage, but the content seems to be stored in Memory.

`string pp = "value1";` should not be valid Solidity - the compiler should reject it, but even if it accepts it, it should write to storage.

i don't know if this is related, but when I have this: 
function arrayTest(uint[4] h)
{
    uint[4] memory copy = h;
}
the DataLocation of "copy" is not set.
