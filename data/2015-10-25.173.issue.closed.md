# [\#173 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/173) `closed`: failed to inherit some members

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/924397?u=4c3e5a7b67595961461f5ac3e1dd41aca26a5b4b&v=4" width="50">[nmushegian](https://github.com/nmushegian) opened issue at [2015-10-25 14:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/173):

```
data/balance_db_test.sol:29:9: Error: Member "assertFalse" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in contract DSBalanceDB_Test
        this.assertFalse(ok, "sub failed below zero");
```

`assertFalse` is a function on `Test`, of which `DSBalanceDB_Test` is an instance.

The crazy thing is that `assertTrue` is available, as are a seemingly random set of functions from `Test`. Why does it get confused about the type?

(I have to exclude the `this` to get a clearer error message, otherwise it tells me `assertFalse` is an just undeclared identifier)

Thank you for reporting this issue. If possible, please check by in [gitter](http://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) because it is much easier to find the cause of this problem there.

My first guesses without seeing the source code would be:
1. `assertFalse` is not publicly visible, and because of that, `this.assertFalse` cannot be found.
2. `assertFalse` is an overloaded function (declared multiple times with different argument types) and none of the argument types you give match one of the functions.

The error appears or dissappears based on whether I try to build this contract in my long list of files:

```
contract False {
    function() returns (bool) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

The error doesn't appear in files that seem to have anything to do with this. Very weird.

Were you able to find out how to reliably reproduce this?

Please reopen if the problem is reproducible.
