Not too dissimilar to Python, but basically parameters that default to a certain value should they not be filled. Would make for flexibility in contracts.

I fear this rather has to be not too dissimilar to C++, as we have to generate a fixed signature for every function.

Ok, I probably did not use the right words. I think this is a good feature, and it will be more similar to how it is in C++ than how it is in Python.
There will be distinct functions (as far as the ABI is concerned) for each number of given arguments.
It might be difficult to implement that for `external` functions because we cannot write to CALLDATA.

Definitely in favor of including optional parameters with optional defaults in the language. Especially useful as an alternative to constructor overloading.

I understand that default parameter can be easier to use, but it's unnecessary:

```
contract Donations {
    event Donated(uint256 value, address donator, string name);
    
    function donate(string _name) public payable {
        emit Donated(msg.value, msg.sender, _name);
    }
    
    function donate() public payable {
        donate("Anonymous");
    }
}
```

Let's keep Solidity simple.

I believe @MichalZalecki 's solution works as long as there's only one optional parameter

Could this work like C++ does? As far as I am aware, C++ generates one function and just adds the missing ones to a call when a caller doesn't include all arguments.

No, it is not implemented yet. We used "0.5.1" as a codeword for "after 0.5.0", which grew too large after some time and was renamed to "backlog non-breaking".

Just to make it explicit: do the mentions of C++ mean variadic/vararg-style functions? 
Seeing that the abi.encode() functions are variadic made me think that the functionality HAD to be supported, so maybe mentioning that it is not would be helpful.

Variadic functions are a different category, so they are out of scope for this issue. I also think that it is much easier to get something wrong than it is already with default arguments.

I agree that it is easier to get something wrong, and yet lack of variadic functions forces boilerplate and code repetition, which also causes its own problems.

This issue has been stale for quite some time, but I feel like the discussion should be kept relevant.
Answeing to what @MichalZalecki [said](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/232#issuecomment-405080369)
Although what he suggested works, it does not work for constructors. If I'd like to have optional parameters in the constructor, I'd have to duplicate my constructur, one with the parameters and one without them, and would get an error while compiling saying that I already have a constructor defined elasewhere.

Changing the way the constructor works would be a breaking change beyond the compiler/language, but every web3 tool would need to be changed. The reason is the "function signature" is not transmitted for constructor parameters, so there's no way to tell them apart.

Under what circumstances is it important to have different constructors? Why not just create different contracts, inheriting from the same, with different constructors:
```solidity
contract A {
  constructor(uint a) public { }
}

contract DefaultA is A {
  constructor() A(1) public { }
}
```

@axic One scenario would be where you have a really flexible agreement. For example you might have a weekly agreement and a monthly agreement. It'd be handy from a dApp point of view to only have to deploy and manage one type of smart contract, then be able to initialise it by just calling different constructors instead of having to deploy a specific type of agreement and manage multiple ones on the app side.

You could absolutely do what you're suggesting and just deploy different contracts for the various types of agreements, it's just really heavy in some cases if the differences are small. Most programming languages I know of support this type of polymorphic constructor, so it's a useful pattern to have available, but there is absolutely a workaround that works as you say.

Same as c#, Java, Python etc.

i'm working with a constructor that accepts either an existing address if an external contract is known, or it deploys a new contract based on config for that contract if needed

doing this 2-3 times shows why the "why don't you just use inheritance" argument is limited, and function overloading too, because it ends up needing every combination of present/not-present arguments specified

if you have 3 arguments that are optional you need to specify 2^3 contracts/overloads, and so on...

Another use case is testing functions when running dapptools. It would be nice to have functions used for some tests to have optional parameters

alternatively, an `Option` or `Maybe` type would work fine by lifting the issue up to the struct level as optional field values would be equivalently expressive
