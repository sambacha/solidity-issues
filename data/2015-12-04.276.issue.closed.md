This should produce a compiler error.  It seems like a common problem for people coming from languages that do implicit returns of last evaluated values:

```
function someFunction(address _someaddress) returns (bool) {
   owner = _someaddress;
}
```

Note that there are legitimate use-cases for the following code:
```
function f(uint x) returns (bool error) {
  if (x > 7) return true;
  do_something();
}
```

I guess it is fine to add a warning if none of the return variables are assigned and there is no return statement that includes a value.

Other cases might be debatable. In any case, all of them can be silenced.

Maybe it makes sense making this part of the static analyzer?

@chriseth at the very least in that example, `do_something` should be in the return statement, also, the return bool should not be named, as error should be set somewhere in that statement. I think small changes like this could really help produce safer code.

Closing this since I don't see how it can be implemented without giving too many false positives.
