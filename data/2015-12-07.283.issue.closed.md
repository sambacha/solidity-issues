# [\#283 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/283) `closed`: `call`/`callcode` discrepancy
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following contract's `makeTestCall2` function attempts to call its `testCall2` function using `callcode`, creating the calldata manually:

```
contract TestCall {
    bytes _tmpCalldata;
    uint public testArg0;
    uint public testArg1;
    function makeTestCall2() {
        _tmpCalldata.length=64; for(uint i=0;i<64;++i) _tmpCalldata[i]=0xff;
        TestCall(this).callcode(bytes4(0x0f682008),_tmpCalldata); // 0x0f682008=testCall2(uint256,uint256)
    }
    function testCall2(uint arg0,uint arg1) { testArg0=arg0; testArg1=arg1; }
}
```

(This code is in one contract for testing purposes; the eventual goal is for the callee to be in a library.)

Expected result: both `testArg0` and `testArg1` end up both set to 0xFFF(...)FFF.

Actual result: variable (when I run the above on ethersim, both are set to 0; but as part of my larger test, `testArg` was set to 4, and `testArg1`, 0.)

Using `call` rather than `callcode` gives the expected result.

It seems callcode does not copy storage to memory.

Ok, right. It is on purpose that callcode does not copy storage to memory. The reason is that you can actually pass a storage pointer via callcode, as opposed to call. If you want to force copying to memory, assign the data to a local (memory) variable before calling.

Closing as not a bug.

Thanks - pretty sure I get what's going on now. Copying to a memory byte array does work.

I wonder if callcode should let you be more explicit about whether you're passing in a byte array (and you want to pass its address - obviously a memory array would then be an error), or you're passing in a byte array (and it contains the call data for the call - and a storage array would then be an error).

My proposed solution to this would be to have a custom encoding function that handles this for you and returns a `bytes memory` that you can then pass to the callcode.
