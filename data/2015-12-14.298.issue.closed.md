# [\#298 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/298) `closed`: Clarify "private" visibility in documentation

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2582071?v=4" width="50">[jonasnick](https://github.com/jonasnick) opened issue at [2015-12-14 12:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/298):

I have heard from one dapp developer that he thought that giving "private" visibility
to a variable would hide its contents from a blockchain observer. This is certainly
not the case and any such confusion is very dangerous.
Therefore the documentation should make it clear that marking a variable as "private"
does not conceal its contents to anyone other than on-chain contracts.
