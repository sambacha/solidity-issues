# [\#403 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/403) `closed`: Solc preprocessor

Been using gpp to modify and add debugging code in contracts when test-running a somewhat big application. Debug version mostly includes things like a few extra solidity events, and using different values for some constants. It works somewhat well but it is hard since it has to pre-process every contract in the build hierarchy manually. An optional pre-processing step in solc would maybe be good at some point (or something to that effect).
