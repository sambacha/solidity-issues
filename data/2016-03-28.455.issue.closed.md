There is currently no documentation on updating solidity when compiled from source. Should be an easy bit to describe.

What do you think of the idea of merging the Solidity readthedocs content into http://ethdocs.org, @chriseth?

http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/building-from-source/

When we've done the repo re-org, we'll end up with the following repos each of which should be buildable independently, and each of which should have pretty much the same instructions.
- alethzero (until it is killed)
- cpp-ethereum
- mix
- solidity

I'm for that.

@bobsummerwill could you explain a bit more what you mean by "merging"? The solidity docs are the language reference and I think it should be tightly coupled with solidity - features should be documented in the same commit or PR in which they are implemented. How to build solidity can be a link into the ethdocs page.

Oh - I see, so the readthedocs for solidity are within a sub-folder of the solidity repo itself?    I assumed that there was another repo for them (as we have for homestead docs).

I guess the same argument holds for the cpp-ethereum docs, eh?    They are currently hosted in https://github.com/ethereum/homestead-guide/tree/master/source/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum, but with the repo reorganization, it would arguably be better for them to move to https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/docs, so they can also be 1-1 updated in parallel with code changes.

Right now we have a mixture of different approaches.
