# [\#476 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/476) `closed`: Making Multiple Inheritance more idiot proof
**Labels**: `enhancement`

currently this works:

```
contract O {}
contract A {}
contract B {}
contract K1 is O, A, B {}
contract K2 is O, A {}
contract J is K1, K2 {}
```

but this does not

```
contract O {}
contract A {}
contract B {}
contract K1 is O, A, B {}
contract K2 is A, O {}
contract J is K1, K2 {}
```

Is there any way to make this slightly more idiot proof so that simply flips like this do not fail somebody in their attempts to compile?

Please read up on python's multiple inheritance model and C3 linearization. We could detect whether the order actually is important or not, but that does not have high priority.

I know it doesn't have high priority, but that's why I'm leaving it here :)

I too faced that issue , according to the new implementation of Python's MRO, preference to a class while inheriting in a Diamond problem is given in the sequence they are written. 
But I found this not working in case of Solidity, based on the fact that it is supposed to follow the same ideology. So,

contract K2 is O, A {}               <--- This works
contract K2 is A, B {}               <--- This doesn't
