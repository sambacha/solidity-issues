What is the proper way to signal support/desire for features in this project?  Is adding a üëç reaction to the original noticed by anyone, or is there a better way to say, "I could really use this feature too"?

@MicahZoltu I think a comment saying "I could really use this feature too" will probably work best :-). At least I noticed that one and hadn't noticed the :+1: reaction.
