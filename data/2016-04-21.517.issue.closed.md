# [\#517 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/517) `closed`: failing ecrecover

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-04-21 11:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/517):

A failing ecrecover does not write to its output area. Solidity should handle than correctly and not just return the input data which might have been there before:

use different input and output areas and write zeros to the output area before calling ecrecover
