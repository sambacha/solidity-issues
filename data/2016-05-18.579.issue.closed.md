# [\#579 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/579) `closed`: Improving library names for the linker
**Labels**: `enhancement`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-05-18 13:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/579):

Library names are currently not globally unique, but they have to for the purpose of the linker. For this, it should be possible to optionally specify the file name where a library is defined at link-time.

Furthermore, linker objects should be exposed by solc-js.

 - [x] store file name for all libraries / linker identifiers
 - [ ] expose unlinked objects correctly
 - [x] make relevant changes in the metadata output (turn into multi-level object)
