it would act in the idea of a sha3 of each of the combined inner types of the struct to map to each value. 

For example

```
struct A {
uint b;
string c;
}
```

would be represented in a mapping by sha3(b, c). For inner structs, this would go sequentially as they all appear in storage for as many types pop up.

Indeed, as log as the structs do not contain mappings. Furthermore, the sha3 should be applied with "tight packing" applied, i.e. no padding to 32 bytes and structs and tuples should be handled identically.

tuples handled identically? How do you mean? Can you write an example please?

So should it look something like this for a tuple?

```
contract test {
            mapping((uint, string, int) => string) aMapping;
        }
```

or should we enable var here? I think adding var is not the best here...

also...if this is the case....should we allow arrays? Or is that overkill?

yes, that is how tuples are written, but I think we should keep the focus for now.
