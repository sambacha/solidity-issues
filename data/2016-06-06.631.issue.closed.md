I have a contract compiling good on https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/#version=soljson-latest.js, but failing with a segmentation fault by command line.
the contract:

```
contract InstructionsInterface {
    address beneficial;
    string data;
    function Instructions(address destination, string encryptedData);
    function getData() constant returns(string);
}

contract Instructions is InstructionsInterface {
    function Instructions(address destination, string encryptedData) {
        beneficial = destination;
        data = encryptedData;
    }

    function getData() constant returns(string) {
        return data;
    }
}
```

the command line:

```
./solc --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.3.4-0a0fc046/RelWithDebInfo-Darwin/appleclang/JIT
â€¦
./solc Instructions.sol 
Segmentation fault: 11
```

You're on Darwin...that may be why.

No it's not - it is easily reproducable and I'm working on a fix.

The issue was that the abstract function was "implemented" by the constructor of the derived class - which was not detected during type checking.
