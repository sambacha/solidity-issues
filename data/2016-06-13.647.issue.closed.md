# [\#647 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/647) `closed`: Modifier definitions without an underscore don't throw an error
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
modifier insurerOnly {
    if(msg.sender != insurer) throw;
}
```

Looks fair enough... But any method using this modifier will lose it body due to lack of underscore.

This should be a compile time error. Why would you ever want a modifier to wipe out the method body?
