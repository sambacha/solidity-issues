# [\#684 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/684) `closed`: Simple solidity contract, issue with libraries

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/811824?v=4" width="50">[slothbag](https://github.com/slothbag) opened issue at [2016-06-25 03:01](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/684):

I'm having trouble getting a library to work.  I have run the `linker` to ensure the library address is in the calling contract.  And I have thoroughly read the doco here: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#libraries

It compiles fine, but fails during the deploy (due to the library call in the constructor)

From what I understand it should be possible to call library contracts like this.  But the contract fails to deploy (TxReceipt shows all gas used)

I'm compiling on Windows using latest solc, deploying to geth on osx on a private chain.

```
library MyLib {
    function init() {
        log0("Init success");
    }
}

contract MyContract {
    function MyContract() {
        MyLib.init();
    }
}
```

I just tried some of the examples at solidity.readthedocs.io.. 2 wont compile, the 2 that did compile throw errors in geth.. Is there something broken with libraries at the moment?

So you're deploying the `MyLib` library first? Then getting its address and linking it into `MyContract`'s bytecode?

> 2 wont compile, the 2 that did compile throw errors in geth

Can you show which ones aren't compiling? Can you show the errors?

Yup, deploy MyLib first, grab the address and run `solc test.sol --libraries MyLib:0x1234` and have confirmed that 0x1234 exists in the .bin file

I also just copy & paste the address manually into the bin, same issue.

I'm running this on a private testnet at block 500.. do libraries and the more recent delegatecall work on private chains?

The 4 examples under `Libraries` and `Using For` http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html?highlight=libraries#libraries produce the following errors:

**Libraries**
Example 1

```
test.sol:39:5: Error: Identifier not found or not unique.
    Set.Data knownValues;
    ^------^
```

Example 2:

```
test.sol:47:17: Error: Undeclared identifier.
        var x = bigint.fromUint(7);
                ^----^
```

**Using For**
Example 3: Compiles, deploys but throws when calling register()

Example 4: 

```
test.sol:4:35: Error: Different number of arguments in return statement than in returns declaration.
            if (self[i] == value) return i;
                                  ^------^
test.sol:5:9: Error: Different number of arguments in return statement than in returns declaration.
        return uint(-1);
        ^-------------^
test.sol:20:22: Error: Member "find" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in uint256[] storage ref
        uint index = data.find(_old);
                     ^-------^
```

I believe your problem is that geth thinks that it's pre-Homestead. There are a lot of checks in geth for whether it has reached the Homestead block, and I assume some of those checks enable/disable the latest support for libraries. You can configure your private blockchain's `homesteadBlock` in its genesis block like this: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Command-Line-Options#init

Ahh great, yeah I thought that it might be something like that.. i'll give that a try

Thats it. Thanks heaps!

Regarding the compilation problems, I confirmed via [browser-solidity](https://ethereum.github.io/browser-solidity/) that examples 2 and 4 do not compile. I'm fixing the documentation. Thanks for pointing that out.
