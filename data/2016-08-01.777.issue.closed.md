So I must confess that I don't have the Travis-foo yet to know exactly what you mean there.

I've not seen examples of Matrix being used to do DIFFERENT things - only as a means of parameterizing configurations.

Do you have some example which I could mimic?   Thanks!

I guess you can define an environment variable to specify the thing you want to do and then condition on that during the actual run.

We should also add a similar thing for emscripten.
