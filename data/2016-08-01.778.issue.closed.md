I think it would make sense changing the _"error"_ field to a map of:
- severity (warning or error)
- message
- location
  - source file name (or pointer to the source object / identifier)
  - source line

The improvement would be twofold:
- No need to manually trying to assess the severity
- Proper link to the source file

Hm, how is that different from the way it is currently done?
