# [\#802 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/802) `closed`: Throw Error on Abstract Contract

Currently, libraries are not allowed to inherit from each other. As a result, the following code should throw an error because it does not produce any bytecode and it will also never be inherited from, thereby, it is completely useless.

```
library Abstract {
    function func() returns (uint);
}
```

This is not useless. I actually use abstract libraries in https://github.com/ConsenSys/live-libs in order to allow contracts to compile against libraries when the source code is unavailable. (Live Libs generates the abstract source from the stored ABI.)

Ah, I stand corrected!
