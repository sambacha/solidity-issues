# [\#846 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/846) `closed`: Style: single quotes for string literals
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `documentation :book:`

All the code examples use double quotes for string literals. String literals actually support single quotes too. The style guide currently doesn't any of them.

I think it would make sense to either:
a) remove single quotes from string literals
b) document both options and allow both in the style guide
c) document both options, but recommend double (or single) quotes in the style guide (but more importantly, a consistent use of quotes).

@Denton-L @chriseth what do you think?

I think option C would make the most sense because it would be the least "breaking".

We have a breaking release upcoming plus it wasn't even documented. It could be removed if desired.

It is like Javascript, both double and single quotes represent strings.

no but I mean, what are we going to do about backticks?

They are currently not part of the lexer.

Should they be a part of the lexer? Personally I'm fine with leaving single quotes as is...just make sure that single quotes match to single quotes and double quotes to double quotes, etc.

Ho do you expect bacticks to work if they are not parsed?

right, I'm saying maybe they should be parsed (this is incredibly off topic though and I'm going to shut up now).

Both string styles are supported because we try to be close to javascript syntax. We can recommend one of them and clean up the documentation.
