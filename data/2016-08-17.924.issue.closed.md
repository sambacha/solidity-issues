Homebrew issues ...

See https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/jobs/153117742

```
carthage: A full installation of Xcode.app 7.3 is required to compile this software.
Installing just the Command Line Tools is not sufficient.
Xcode can be installed from the App Store.
Error: An unsatisfied requirement failed this build.
```

I'm digging, but it looks like one the packages which is part of the TravisCI image for Yosemite (`carthage`), has decided that it wants you to have a full xcode install, not just command-line tools.

Formula doesn't seem to have changed:

Hmm.   I logged this under `solidity` because I could swear that I saw this happening in `solidity` and in `cpp-ethereum`, but I can only see it happening in `cpp-ethereum` now.

I won't bother closing and moving this issue.   We need to address it either way, and I don't actually think that it is specific to either codebase.    It will be me fixing it either way :-)
