# [\#931 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/931) `closed`: Returning a fixed-length array causes other return values to get messed up (browser-solidity)
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Why does the function below return `[[1, 2], [2, 3]]` instead of the expected `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`? Tested in browser-solidity.

```
contract Contract {
    function test() constant returns(uint8[2], uint8[2]){
        uint8[2] memory a = [1, 2];
        uint8[2] memory b = [3, 4];
        return (a, b);
    }
}
```

Returning a fixed-length array as the first element in the return tuple appears to throw off the indexed memory location of the following elements, regardless of their type:

```
function test() constant returns(uint8[2], uint8) {
    uint8[2] memory a = [1, 2];
    uint8 b = 3;
    return (a, b); // WRONG: [[1, 2], 2]
}

function test() constant returns(uint8[4], uint8) {
    uint8[4] memory a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    uint8 b = 3;
    return (a, b); // WRONG: [[1, 2, 3, 4], 2]
}
```

The raw hex data is correct, so this seems to be a bug in ethereumjs-abi (the decoder routine): https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-abi/issues/29

Thanks! I will watch that issue.
