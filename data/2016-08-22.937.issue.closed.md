I'm trying to compile on Ubuntu 16.04.01 and its giving the following errors:

```
/usr/bin/ld.gold: error: /usr/local/lib/libjsoncpp.a(json_value.cpp.o): requires unsupported dynamic reloc 11; recompile with -fPIC
```

Which compiler do you use? How exactly did you compile?

Ill have to check when im back at the keyboard.. but I'm just using standard gcc that comes default. Pretty are I just run make solc.

Ill provide specifics soon

Looks like I have cpp 5.4.0 installed.. I assume thats what cmake/make is using under the hood.

I git cloned the repo then cloned, built and installed jsoncpp library, then in the solidity folder

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make solc
```

Did you use `scripts/install_deps.sh`?

When you cloned, did you run `git clone --recursive`? If not, try running `git submodule update --init`.

Thanks for the tips, the git submodule didn't help. I went to do the install_deps script but cant risk breaking other dependencies on this box.. so will leave it.

My goal was to do a windows build from linux.  Is there any plans for a nightly windows solc.exe binary? :)

^ Not currently, though, but we do hope to get to weekly releases.

"do a windows build from linux" - are you trying a cross-compilation?

Yeah, I just need a recent Windows build.. I thought it would be easy to cross compile from linux.  The OSX build was super easy..  Linux and Windows proving more challenging.

@karalabe has lots of experience with cross-compiling using Dockerfiles.

Should be fixed now, as we link statically to libjsoncpp. closing - please reopen if the bug is still present on develop.

`cmake ..` fails on this line https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/CMakeLists.txt#L16

because the file `deps/jsoncpp.cmake` is not in the repo.

@slothbag you need to update the `deps` submodule I think

Thanks, got it building on Linux now.  Had to update and build latest Boost also.
