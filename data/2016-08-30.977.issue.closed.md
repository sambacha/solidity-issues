# [\#977 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/977) `closed`: Should `.send(0)` be handled specially?

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2016-08-30 22:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/977):

The "whitehat withdraw contract" had a bug of the following form:

```
function f(uint amount1, uint amount2) {
  if (!x.send(amount1) || !y.send(amount2)) throw;
}
```

Here, the user can basically specify how much to send to each of the two accounts `x` and `y`. The problem is that if `amount1` is zero, the call does not classify as a "send" and thus the gas stipend logic is not triggered. This means that the receiving account gets zero gas to react and will throw if it is a contract.

Should this situation be handled specially?
