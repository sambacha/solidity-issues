# [\#992 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/992) `closed`: Introduce a real constant keyword and rename the current behaviour
**Labels**: `enhancement`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2016-09-01 12:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/992):

I think the following makes more sense compared to what we have now.

Now:
- `constant` function should not modify the state (not fully enforced yet)
- `constant` _state variable_ (ie. the one in the class and not in a method) is evaluated every time it is called

After the change:
- 1) the keyword `view` is introduced for functions (it replaces `constant`). Calling a `view` cannot alter the behaviour of future interactions with any contract. This means such functions cannot use `SSTORE`, cannot send or receive ether and can only call other `view` or `pure` functions.
- 2) the keyword `pure` is introduced for functions, they are `view` functions with the additional restriction that their value only depends on the function arguments. This means they cannot use `SSTORE`, `SLOAD`, cannot send or receive ether, cannot use `msg` or `block` and can only call other `pure` functions.
- 3) the keyword `constant` is invalid on functions
- 4) the keyword `constant` on any variable means it cannot be modified (and could be placed into memory or bytecode by the optimiser)
- ~~5) the keyword `volatile` is introduced for variables, which read their referenced value every time (this is what `constant` does today to variables)~~ [**agreed to remove this functionality**]

Any example of the `volatile` keyword:

```
contract A {
    uint volatile number = block.number;
    function a() returns (uint) {
        return number; // this returns the *current* block.number every time it is called
    }
}
```

I'm not sure the `volatile` option is useful and thus we might decide to remove it.

This seems like the wrong word; `constant` functions are definitely not stateless; they often depend on state. If a new name must be used, perhaps something like `immutable` or `pure` (in the sense that a pure function is side-effect-free, which is what we're really describing)?

I'm trying to find the word and stateless ia far from perfect. It should describe that the state is not modified.

Also additionally we could introduce real constant functions, which are indeed stateless and dont depend on the state. I.e. calculating something based on the inputs.

Well, from a CS-theoretic POV, 'pure' is definitely the term you want. More informally, 'side effect free', but that's harder to condense into a keyword.

I don't think so; certainly this is the only usage for the term I'm aware of.

Many of the definitions of `pure` say it does not depend on state and no matter when it is called, based on the input parameters it should always return the same predictable result.

Therefore it does not suit our application.

@VoR0220 `static` does not reflect what it is. The `volatile` part is a different behaviour (= what constant variables do).

Updated the description with further clarification which should help coming up with a good name.

hmmm...so I like that idea in regards to `pure` it enables solidity to become "functional" (and pleases all the zealots), but in regards to `view`...I think it might be better to just bite the bullet and call it `immutable` (because that's what it is). As for `volatile`, there are uses for it, but not many...probably just call it `mutable`.

The problem with `immutable` is that you cannot apply that adjective to the function. The function itself never changes.

right but the output does. Perhaps you could create such a differentiation. You might do something like this

@VoR0220 it is not the output or the function which is mutable/immutable.

Case 1: function can read state variables (sload). The output of this function will depend on the current state.

Case 2: function can modify state variables (sstore). The output of this function will depend on the current state, as well as it can change the state, which then affects any future invocations.

I've borrowed `view` from databases. The function provides a modified`view` of the current state (i.e. it uses sload and applies transformations).

Doesn't the current proposal fit `pure`?  2) the keyword `pure` is introduced for functions (they cannot call SSTORE or SLOAD)
Which part is `pure` breaking?

I think the 4 proposals are good.  No one else has made comments about `readonly`, and I think it fits well with in the 1st proposal, which would read as:
1) the keyword `readonly` is introduced for functions (it replaces constant, these functions cannot call SSTORE, but can call SLOAD)

`readonly` and `pure` sound accurate enough.

Sorry for the confusion, the description was updated after those comments. `pure` (and every other keyword) was initially proposed for what 1) is. It fits 2) well.

For 1) I like `view`, `readonly`, and `nonmutating` (but this is way too long).

Yes, you're right - I stand corrected. `readonly` is probably the sanest I've seen so far, though `view` also works.

RE constant/volatile/etc, besides dropping the functionality (which seems good to me), why not call it 'alias' or 'define'? That seems to be effectively what it is.

I think that `volatile` is just a buggy behaviour of `constant`. We can introduce something like `alias` in the future, it is certainly planned for types (`using x = y`) and could also be introduced for general expressions.

I updated the description to specify the behaviour in more detail.

Question: Can a pure function return `address(this)`? I.e. is it required to be pure just from its source code or is it fine to be pure "after deployment"? Can a pure function return a storage value that it set in the constructor (i.e. from the block hash) and never modified in the contract?

From the keywords: The problem with `readonly` is similar to the one with `immutable` - it applies to the function while it should apply to the state. On the other hand, `view` is not an adjective.

@chriseth moved `alias` into its own issue and removed `volatile` from the description.

> I.e. is it required to be pure just from its source code or is it fine to be pure "after deployment"? 

That is a good question. I would argue that it is more useful to allow `this` and any constants set during the constructor (if that becomes possible).

Storage should not be accessed by `pure` functions unless we introduce `writeonce` storage slots set during the constructor, but what is the reason to use them? They are more expensive than storing it in bytecode.

I think this question also applies to `pure`. It is a though question, logs do change the state, but in a way which doesn't influence the future execution of either `view` or `pure` functions.

For `volatile`, would you be able to do this:

```
uint volatile foo = block.number + block.timestamp;
```

Or even:

```
uint volatile foo = this.bar()
```

If so, speaking from my experience as a python developer who has dealt many times with debugging code involving @property declarations, this sounds extremely dangerous. Things should do what they seem to do and nothing else; variable lookups that are actually function calls that might lead to re-entrant weirdness sound like a nightmare for auditing and could potentially mislead contract readers.

Note that this "volatile" thing is abusing one application of the `constant` keyword. This application was intended to provide actual compile-time (or at least deploy-time) constants. As everywhere else, this is not yet correctly enforced.

Perhaps we need to define for `view` whether it can take the state of the contract only or the entire state as an input.

`pure`:
- cannot use `selfdestruct`, `new`, `log`, `this.balance`, `address.balance`, `tx.*`, `msg.*`, `block.*`

`view`:
- cannot use `selfdestruct`, `new`
- can use `this.balance`
- can use `tx.*`, `msg.*`, `block.*`

Canonically speaking, `view` should not use `log` as it changes the state, however, currently it changes the state in a way it won't affect future invocations of `view`. Being future proof, I would say it shouldn't be allowed to use it.

You are right, in serenity, log will be changed to actually make modifications to storage of a certain contract. This means, log should be viewed as a call to a non-view, non-pure function of another contract. Because of that, view should not be able to use log, I would say.

I think we more or less found that our framework is not yet fully specified because pure functions might modify memory. My current proposal would be the following:

view and pure are attributes applied to the function, and they only concern storage and other permanent state.
The pure keyword should be renamed, because a "pure" function is still able to modify memory references that are passed in (but not storage references). In order to prevent this, the type of such an input variable has to be `<memory type> constant`.

So in essence, "view" and "pure" apply to "this" (and other state including other contracts) and all other input variables have their own specifiers.

I suggest the new name as `expression` or `volatile` that will evaluate in each call.
See this code:
```solidity
contract LockableCoin is AbstractCoin {
    //creation time, defined when contract is created
    uint public creationTime = now;
    //time constants, defines epoch size and periods
    uint public constant UNLOCKED_TIME = 25 days;
    uint public constant LOCKED_TIME = 5 days;
    uint public constant EPOCH_LENGTH = UNLOCKED_TIME + LOCKED_TIME;
    //current epoch constant formula, recalculated in any contract call
    uint public constant CURRENT_EPOCH = (now - creationTime) / EPOCH_LENGTH + 1;    
    //next lock constant formula, recalculated in any contract call
    uint public constant NEXT_LOCK = (creationTime + CURRENT_EPOCH * UNLOCKED_TIME) + (CURRENT_EPOCH - 1) * LOCKED_TIME;
//(...)
}

Why word volatile being not considered? I see use cases for this, and its really useful and easy to understand. Volatile are expressions that result a value change due contract storage, chain or call variables change.
Such as:
```
 //caller balance
    mapping (address => uint) balances;
    uint volatile callerBalance = balances[msg.sender];

//lock epoch
    uint256 public creationTime = now;
    uint256 public unlockedTime = 25 days 
    uint256 public lockedTime = 5 days; 
    uint256 public volatile EPOCH_LENGTH = unlockedTime + lockedTime;
    uint256 public volatile CURRENT_EPOCH = (now - creationTime) / EPOCH_LENGTH + 1;    
    uint256 public volatile NEXT_LOCK = (creationTime + CURRENT_EPOCH * unlockedTime) + (CURRENT_EPOCH - 1) * lockedTime;
```

I was first fooled by a constant owner that changed in any call, but using a special keyword for this case makes sense.
Just removing this hability makes solidity more restrictive. 
Volatile is useful when you need a constant that is synced to various variables and is used a lot of times in almost all functions, if not this case, internal function and a memory var is better.

I like to restrict the number of keywords as much as possible, especially if there is another solution that does almost the same thing.

Here is a summary of the current design:

There's enum for `statemutability`, from most restricted to least restricted: `pure`, `view`, `nonpayable`, `payable`. A function can only be one of these.

view:
- cannot use `selfdestruct`, `new`
- can use `this.balance`
- can use `tx.*`, `msg.*`, `block.*`
- can only call `view` or `pure` functions
- cannot send ether
- can use `sload`
- cannot use `sstore`

pure:
- cannot use `selfdestruct`, `new`, `log`, `this.balance`, `address.balance`, `tx.*`, `msg.*`, `block.*`
- can only call `pure` functions
- cannot use `sload`
- cannot use `sstore`

Remarks:
- JSON ABI has a new field `statemutability` introduced with a string value as above
- JSON ABI keeps `constant`/`payable` for backwards compatibility for a while
- constructor / fallback cannot be `view` or `pure`
- `constant` as a specifier on functions is phased out (removed at the next breaking release)

This is finally implemented and documented. To only thing left is enforcing these restrictions and that is tracked in #2606.

What version is this implemented in?

@fulldecent I believe `view` and `constant` are both working right now, I would like to see `readonly`, but for compatibility I prefer to stick with `view`, it's still less ambiguous than `constant` anyway

Is it normal behavior for a `pure` function to access a `constant` "state variable"?

It make sense architecture-wise, but is this intended and will be doubled down on?

A `constant` "state variable" is just a constant value, it is not a storage variable.
