Broken:

```

Working:

```

        assembly {
            ret := call(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

      POP           ret := call(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...
    tag 5           {\n            ret := call(0, ...
      JUMPDEST          {\n            ret := call(0, ...
      SWAP1             {\n            ret := call(0, ...
      JUMP [out]            {\n            ret := call(0, ...
    .data
```

Seems like it is missing a POP.

Inline assembly does no magic for you. If you leave an item on the stack at the end, that is your responsibility. We might add a warning if such a thing happens, though.

I was under the impression this change happened lately, but it seems like I only had some code snippets which probably had used some compiler bug, because they worked.

Don't have any of those snippets now, so no way to verify.
