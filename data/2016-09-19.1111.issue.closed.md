Greetings,
by writing code for a linter i have noticed that errors printed by solc have not a specific syntax.
Dew to that fact implementing a linter for solidity is not straightforward, especially due to changes of the error output during the development life cycle resulting in different error formats across the code.
I strongly suggest to implement an error format specification for reporting.

Which part of the errors would you like to formalize?

I think #1387 fixes this.

With #1387 the specification is in place. (Needs to be implemented too.)
