- How about modifiers, struct, event, variable definitions?
- It appears that only `@name` and `@author` work for the contract definition. Would be nice to include `@dev` and `@notice`. 
- should docs also be outputted for inherited methods? otherwise, doc generators will need to manually parse the AST to determine inherited methods
- I noticed that the method params are getting added to `devdoc` rather than `userdoc`, contradicting the [docs](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format)

@hitchcott would you be interested in helping to design a better version of the natspec? I'm thinking a combined user/devdoc.

Sounds good @axic, I am actively working on doxity and there's good opportunity to explore what is needed. What's the best way for me to help with this - should I draft an EIP?

@hitchcott we could have a chat on gitter with anyone interested in this topic.

Also please check https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format first as that defines the `userdoc`.

@axic @hitchcott After your chat on gitter, could an EIP be written to make it clear? (The wikis are mostly old.)

One part I'm wary of is if returns are going to need to be named, like:
`function foo() returns (uint r)`
Since `r` is actually a variable and may be unused, I think it leads to issues like
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/718#issue-165439717

For these named returns to be used wider, I think Solidity should be much stricter to prevent misuse: example #1401

Note that the only purpose of `@notice` is to display a message to the user if they invoke a function. This does apply to the fallback function, it may apply to the constructor, but not anything else.

This means that comments applying to the contract itself should probably automatically go to the `@dev` scope.

The `@notice` docs should be inherited.

Method parameters should probably go to both the dev docs and the user docs.

  /// @notice `(balanceInmGAV / 1000).fixed(0,3)` GAV is the total funds available to `who.address()`.
  /// @param who The address of the person whose balance we check
  /// @return The balance of the user provided as argument
  function balance(address who) constant returns (uint256 balanceInmGAV) {
return 100;
}

In the example above, it uses an explicit return 100.  To convey that the 100 is balanceInmGAV, is an unused variable balanceInmGAV needed?

Can we do something like this instead, where we move balanceInmGAV to be strictly a comment?
  /// @notice `(balanceInmGAV / 1000).fixed(0,3)` GAV is the total funds available to `who.address()`.
  /// @param who The address of the person whose balance we check
  /// @return `balanceInmGAV` The balance of the user provided as argument
  function balance(address who) constant returns (uint256) {
return 100;
}

I don't understand this example much, but my point is comments should remain as comments and should not require introducing an unused variable in code.

Sometimes, you need the ability to refer to individual elements of the return tuple. The example is bad, though, I agree.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6937903?u=058e26d648a749b9d89d1a77314d4c7cecd0e51a&v=4" width="50">[ethers](https://github.com/ethers) commented at [2016-10-04 09:54](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1141#issuecomment-265936557):

For refering to tuple elements, just an idea:
/// @return (balance, nonce, counter) 
/// @@balance The balance of the user provided as argument
/// @@nonce The nonce of the ...
/// @@counter The counter of the ...

`function foo() constant returns (uint256, uint256, uint256)`

The comment (balance, nonce, counter) is matched against the tuple (uint256, uint256, uint256).

With tuples, an explicit return might even be more important for clarity:
`return (balance, nonce, counter)` instead of example:
```
function foo() constant returns (uint256 balance, uint256 nonce, uint256 counter) {
  // some code
  nonce = 1;  // nonce is computed first
  // some code
  counter = 2; // then counter
  // some code
  balance = someMap[msg.sender];
}
```

Actually I think `@return` should be very similar to `@param`. How does javadoc/doxygen handle unnamed parameters? I think we can be a bit flexible here:
If there is an identifier after `@return`, try to look it up in the list of return values. If it is there, this is the documentation about that value. If it is of the form `[i]`, it is the documentation of the `i`th return value. Otherwise, it is a string describing the full return tuple.

What's the status of this? There's an annoying problem with functions which have unused arguments because they're meant to be overriden: if you remove the argument name so as to silence the warning, it's impossible to add `@param` documentation for it.

Would also like to know the status of this particularly:
- documentation for internal and private functions
- multiple return values

Please add these items to the checklist in the original message:

* Support for `@dev` tag on a contract
* Support for `event`s

---

Also, I think you can safely check off the item "parameter names."  The devdoc output from v0.4.24 is showing parameter names:

```
            "publicMethod(int256,address,bool)": {
                "details": "publicMethod @dev",
                "params": {
                    "a": "publicMethod @param 2",
                    "b": "publicMethod @param 3",
                    "p": "publicMethod @param"
                },
                "return": "publicMethod @return"
            }
```

And, with the merging of #4542 , it seems that you can also check off "constructor."

Also, @chriseth , [you mentioned above](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1141#issuecomment-262797469) that `@notice` does not apply to the contract definition, but [the wiki explicitly says it does](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format#tags).  Should the wiki be updated, or were you mistaken in that comment?

The wiki is unmaintained.

Any updates on multiple return values? Leaning towards implementing an approach where `@return` functions just like `@param` as per @chriseth suggestion. The field would be of the type (string|object)? depending on the number of identifiers after the first `@return`, where the ith item in the object has the description for the ith return value in the tuple.

Is there any more pushback for supporting named return values as well? That way we can use them as keys instead of relying on the order of the tuple, i.e. making it easier to deal with verifying nested tuple types.

I think we have specific issues now for everything, as well as the natspec project: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects/42

Is there anything else missing from there? Can we close this issue?

In comments above, I had asked for these things to be added to this issue:
* Support for `@dev` tag on a contract
* Support for `event`s

I'd still like to see those happen (if they haven't already) but I really don't care whether they're tracked in this issue or elsewhere.

@feuGeneA Could you please create new separate issues for them? We have found that individual issues work better nowadays.

As an update, I think this issue can now be closed as parts are tracked elsewhere.

- @feuGeneA the `@dev` tag seems to be working on both contracts and interfaces currently
- Events are listed in the userdoc, but not the devdoc. Are you asking for including them in the devdoc too? Created issue #11158 for this.
- "internal library functions" are tracked under #3097
- "parameter names" are tracked under #11120
