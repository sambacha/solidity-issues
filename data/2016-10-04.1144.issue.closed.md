# [\#1144 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1144) `closed`: Inline assembly: cannot use this
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
contract A {
    function a() returns (uint a) {
        assembly {
            a := extcodesize(this)
        }
    }
}
```

`this` is a valid reference when used with `extcodesize` / `balance` / etc, but it doesn't deposit a value to the stack:

```
Untitled1:5:18: Error: Expected instruction(s) to deposit 1 item(s) to the stack, but did deposit 0 item(s).
            a := extcodesize(this)
                 ^---------------^
```

The error marks `extcodesize` and not `this`. Does it work as `extcodesize(0)` or `let a := this let b:=extcodesize(a)`?

Yes, `0` or anything else works.

`this` won't work with `extcodesize()`, `balance()` or anything else.  Neither `a := this` or `let a := this` works.

Actually there are two error messages:

```
Untitled1:5:30: Error: Expected instruction(s) to deposit 1 item(s) to the stack, but did deposit 0 item(s).
            a := extcodesize(this)
                             ^--^
Untitled1:5:18: Error: Expected instruction(s) to deposit 1 item(s) to the stack, but did deposit 0 item(s).
            a := extcodesize(this)
                 ^---------------^
```

Actually there are two different problems:

```
contract A {
    function a() {
        assembly {
            let a := this
        }
    }
}
```

```
Untitled5:4:22: Error: Expected instruction(s) to deposit 1 item(s) to the stack, but did deposit 0 item(s).
            let a := this
                     ^--^
```

And:

```
contract A {
    function a() {
        assembly {
            this
        }
    }
}
```

```
Internal compiler error: Invalid declaration type.
```

Same applies to `super`, `block`, `tx` and any other _magic variable_ declaration.
