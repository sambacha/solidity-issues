# [\#1145 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1145) `closed`: Invalid swap instruction
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following code generates an internal compiler error:

```
contract C {

struct Contractor1
{
    uint owner;
    uint deposit;
    uint contractAddress;
    uint drawData; //byte0=FF, means no data
    uint safed; // data is voted safe,after the deadline
    uint beginTime;
    uint endTime;
    uint deadline; //referees must inject data before it
    uint requestRefereeNumber; //3-Max, minimize is 3 referees;
    uint firstCreateTime; //first generate this contract
    uint updateTime; //when update this contract;
    uint state; //contractor's state: running;waiting-update;updated;
    bytes reviewProfessorIds; //{01 04} {02 08} means id=01 ,con but id=2 pro.
    bytes b2;
    uint[] refereeDrawDatas; //every referee write its drawData here order by refereeIds. bytes8 array cannot be written
    uint[8] refereeIds; //bytes->swap error; byte[8]->store wrong position     
}
 Contractor1[] public contractors1;
}
```

The two uint arrays are not needed to produce the error:

```
Exception during compilation: /src/libsolidity/../libevmasm/Instruction.h(217): Throw in function dev::solidity::Instruction dev::solidity::swapInstruction(unsigned int)
Dynamic exception type: N5boost16exception_detail10clone_implIN3dev8solidity13InvalidOpcodeEEE
std::exception::what: InvalidOpcode
[PN3dev11tag_commentE] = Invalid SWAP instruction requested.
```

Changing the 2 bytes variables to 4 uints will trigger another missed check:

```
Internal compiler error: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.
```

I think the first error is the same as the second only a check is missing from the first.

Did the PR really fix this? We still get an internal compiler error, right?

Yes we get the usual "Stack too deep" issue. The title here is "invalid swap instruction". That is sorted :)
