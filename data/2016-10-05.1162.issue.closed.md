# [\#1162 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1162) `closed`: Can SMOD cause an overflow

This issue follows [the comment](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1091#discussion_r81823543) by @chriseth where he asked if there is an overflow possible from `SMOD` instruction.

For solving this, we need to [determine the SMOD semantics](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/190) and then prove that SMOD does not cause an out-of-range value.

There are no possible overflow from `SMOD` because `sgn(μₛ[0]) (|μₛ[0]| mod |μₛ[1]|)` is always in the range `(-2^{255}, 2^{255})` (the endpoints exclusive).  This is because `|μₛ[0]| mod |μₛ[1]|` is always smaller than `2^{255}`, which is because `|μₛ[1]|` is at most `2^{255}`, when `μₛ[1]` is the smallest signed 256-bit integer.
