# [\#1171 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1171) `closed`: Exception on underflow in subtraction between two signed numbers

Since #796 we are in the process of adding runtime overflow checks.  At 3f833c9ef4fde4edc795b5ddce6a7a2b543e3c00, `solc` does not add runtime checks for underflows during subtraction between two signed numbers.  This can be seen as follows

```
$ solc/solc test.sol --opcodes --optimize | grep CALLDATA
<snip> PUSH1 0x24 CALLDATALOAD PUSH1 0x4 CALLDATALOAD SUB PUSH1 0x60 SWAP1 DUP2 MSTORE PUSH1 0x20 SWAP1 RETURN 
```

Delegated back to #796.
