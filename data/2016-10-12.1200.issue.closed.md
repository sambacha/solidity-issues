# [\#1200 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1200) `closed`: Allow casting to bool

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161566?u=96fa92029184b2a4662eba932c535f39d9d29f1d&v=4" width="50">[ethernomad](https://github.com/ethernomad) opened issue at [2016-10-12 09:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1200):

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract BoolCast {

    function foo() {

        bool a;
        int b;
        uint c;
        address d;
        bytes32 e;

        a = b != 0;     // a = bool(b);
        a = c != 0;     // a = bool(c);
        a = d != 0;     // a = bool(d);
        a = e != 0;     // a = bool(e);
    }

}
```

It's very easy to cast to bool by comparing to 0. Why can't bool() me made to do this?

I think you already answered your question :-)
The expression `b != 0` explains much better what happens. In general, solidity tries not to make as few assumptions about the encoding of values as possible and explicit type conversions work with these encodings.

Fair enough!
