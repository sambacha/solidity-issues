In `0.4.4-develop.2016.10.26+commit.4f1b5d26.Linux.g++` it is impossible to look up events through inheritance if the base contract is explicitly specified.

The following code fails to compile:

```
contract A {
    event x();
}
contract B is A {
    function f() returns (uint) {
        A.x();
        return 1;
    }
}
```

with

```
8:9: Error: Member "x" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in type(contract A)
        A.x();
        ^-^
```

This is very similar to #988.
