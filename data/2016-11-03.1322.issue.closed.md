# [\#1322 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1322) `closed`: Cross platform compilation issues

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/811824?v=4" width="50">[slothbag](https://github.com/slothbag) opened issue at [2016-11-03 07:27](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1322):

I have been relying on the cross platform builds of solc for compiling solidity contracts, OSX builds fairly easily with a couple of brew installs `make solc` works well.

However i'm having trouble compiling on Linux and Windows, although I can probably grab a ppa binary for linux if I really needed it.

After installing jsoncpp and boost libs Windows is throwing errors while running `cmake ..` with errors like cannot find pthread.h

I've tried to use the emscriptem js file but it presents its own set of problems.

Is there a plan (or resources) to maintain the binary releases going forward?

We are constantly building solidity on windows and linux, so I would like to see the issues you are facing. I can try to see whether we can improve on our binary release process.

First issue, is it compatible with Boost 1.6.2?

```
CMake Warning at C:/Program Files/CMake/share/cmake-3.6/Modules/FindBoost.cmake:743 (message):

I think version `106200` is version `1.62.0` which should be supported. I think this error is rather about boost not being found on your system.

After a lot of trial and error I have managed to get solc to build on Linux and Windows.

On Windows this line https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libdevcore/CommonData.cpp#L24 causes an error, comment it out and windows builds fine.

@slothbag can this be closed? Is latest Solidity working for you?

@axic Yeah Solidity is compiling well. Will close this issue.

Thanks
