# [\#1353 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1353) `closed`: Define ABI type for external function types

Follow up of #1122.

Currently it will be defined as `bytes24` and therefore limiting the usefulness to manually driven use cases. It should be `function`.

Alternatively to ease encoding, we could have `encoding type` and `use type` / `hint` two different things.  Encoding would remain `bytes24`, but hint would be `function`.

Implemented in #1122.
