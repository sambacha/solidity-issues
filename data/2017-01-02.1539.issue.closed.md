# [\#1539 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1539) `closed`: Precision in Misc docs about automatic getters

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/979444?v=4" width="50">[rolandkofler](https://github.com/rolandkofler) opened issue at [2017-01-02 16:23](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1539):

From the [Solidity documentation][1]:

> Make your state variables public - the compiler will create getters for you for free.

However, this is an illusion if your variable is of a complex type like `mapping` or `array`.
So could you add: for primitive types in the documentation?

And why does it work in Browser-solidity so smoothly?

It still creates getters for complex types, but those getters require parameters (a key for a mapping, and an index for an array).

Oh, I found the error. Was false alarm! thanks
