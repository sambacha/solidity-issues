# [\#1554 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1554) `closed`: Build fail dep/jsoncpp.list and json/json.h

Attempted build on Linux Mint Sarah, which is based on Ubuntu 16.04.

**cmake** fails because of missing file in cloned repo:

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (include):
  include could not find load file:

    deps/jsoncpp.cmake
```

When I remove the line from CmakeLists.txt and try compile **make** fails with following output:

```
In file included from /home/lash/src/solidity/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp:22:0:
/home/lash/src/solidity/libevmasm/Assembly.h:30:23: fatal error: json/json.h: No such file or directory
```

Although distro not explicitly supported according to `scripts/install_deps.sh`, I've manually checked that dependencies are resolved (except I only manually installed `libboost` libraries that the cmake was complaining about missing, not the `libboost-all` alternative, but it does not seem relevant to this problem).

Never mind, I missed the fact that the deps dir was a reference to another repo.
