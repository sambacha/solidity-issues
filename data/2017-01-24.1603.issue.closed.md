- [x] modify the type system accordingly
- [x] write the decoder for memory
- [x] write the decoder for calldata

@chriseth isn't this fully supported via ABIEncoderV2?

This is still pending, mostly because the stack representation of such types is not yet defined.

This issue is almost one year old, and is still blocking. It makes it impossible to write interfaces with structs as input. Any idea when we can expect a fix ?

@Amxx you can use structs if the implementing function is public instead of external:

```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

interface I {
    struct S { uint a; uint b; }
    function f(S calldata) external returns (uint);
}

contract C is I {
    function f(I.S memory _s) public returns (uint) {
        return _s.a;
    }
}
```

Implemented in #6209
