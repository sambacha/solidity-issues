**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

Memory arrays of gigantic size cause errors during code generation. We should limit `::calldataEncodedSize` for statically-sized arrays of memory type to some sane value.

```	
contract C {
  function fest(uint[85678901234] a) returns (bytes32) {}
}
```

This seems harder to fix properly than originally anticipated. The main reason is that large types themselves are not problematic, only when they are used for memory variables.
