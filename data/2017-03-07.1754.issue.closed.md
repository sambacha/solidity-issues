# [\#1754 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1754) `closed`: Assembly: Implement "jump @label"

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-03-07 17:51](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1754):

In order to be compatible with https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/3686, the following rule should be added to the assembly parser:

If a jump opcode is followed by an identifier that starts with an `@`: `jumpX @label`, it is replaced by `label jumpX`.

I would rather have `solidity` and `geth` flavoured assembly parsers. Currently we do have `"evmasm"` defined as a default (`assembly "evmasm" {}`)

Forcing the flavour is a different issue. Note that `assembly "evmasm" {...}` is only possible for inline assembly.

I guess we won't implement this anymore since we are moving away from jumps.
