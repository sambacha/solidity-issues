> Introduce .transfer(value) for sending Ether.

Please delete this reckless meme ASAP and stop treating language semantics so recklessly

this is why LLL is making a comeback

This is predominantly designed for being used with an `address`. The fact that the `contract` type is overloaded to have `.send`, `.call`, etc. is up for a different debate.

@nmushegian thanks for your feedback! Let's talk about that on gitter.

I put this as a blocker for the release for now.

We discussed this issue (at least how we interpret it) during the weekly call and came to the following conclusions:

 - if a contract type has a `transfer` function, it will supersede the transfer function on the address type, so the ERC20 tokens should not be affected. Furthermore, the signature of the ERC20 transfer function is different.
 - adding the address members to contract types does not make much sense, so we will probably deprecate them in the future (add a warning) and eventually remove them. The only real use for these members would be `this.balance`, which might stay.

@nmushegian it would be great to have some more input about what exactly you find reckless about this change. If you can come up with a better name for such a function, we are all ears.

Let's chat on gitter, if you guys talked it through it's probably OK, but want to double check

Closing this now in the hope that everyone is satisfied.
