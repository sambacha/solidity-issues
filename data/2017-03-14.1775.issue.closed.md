# [\#1775 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1775) `closed`: less-than or greater-than comparison accidentially allowed for addresses

Solidity has a separate type `address` that cannot be added or multiplied and only be compared against one another.  I think comparing addresses for equality makes sense, but larger-than or smaller-than does not make sense.

Currently ( 409eb9e3e494ad5a45c14eb7f550ad8fad2b5573 ) the following program passes the compiler:

```
contract A {
  function f() {
    address a;
    address b;
    a < b;
  }
}
```

This was done on purpose. The reason is to allow for data structures that require an order on keys.

That's reasonable.
