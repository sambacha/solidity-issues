# [\#1788 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1788) `closed`: Rename address to account

See this old PT story: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/98274220

Does this still makes sense? It is mostly called account in EVM, however we'd need to support `address` for a while and the ABI is stuck with it.

I don't think we should do that for a ton of reasons.
