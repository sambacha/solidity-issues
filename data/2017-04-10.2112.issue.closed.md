# [\#2112 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2112) `closed`: Analyze code effects or state

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-04-10 12:37](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2112):

The current check for `isPure` in the type checker should be extended to similar means of access and to AST nodes beyond expressions.

The `isPure` AST annotation should be extended, so that it is possible to determine:

 - whether the code reads from the state (i.e. is non-pure)
 - whether the code might modify state (i.e. storage, balance, create contracts, etc)

Both of these properties should also take variables and function calls into account. I.e. a statement assigning to a storage variable modifies state, a call to a non-constant function does not modify state, but reads from state.

For now, we assume that passing a storage variable to a constant function can modify storage.

At some point, we also have to determine whether variables declared `constant` are accessed in a way that makes it possible to modify them. This includes passing constant variables to functions as non-constant non-value parameters or accessing "deep elements" of a variable in such a way, i.e. assigning to an element of a constant array.

The ViewPureChecker mostly implements this now.
