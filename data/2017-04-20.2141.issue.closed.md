# problem
I have problems with `solc` on **Debian Jessie stable**


# examples
Using a standard contract `solc` aborts:

    solc token.sol 
    *** Error in `solc': corrupted double-linked list: 0x0000000001c2b360 ***
    Aborted

different but similar with the Minimum viable token MyToken.sol from https://www.ethereum.org/token

```
solc MyToken.sol 
solc: malloc.c:2372: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == (((mbinptr) (((char *) &((av)->bins[((1) - 1) * 2])) - __builtin_offsetof (struct malloc_chunk, fd)))) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size) >= (unsigned long)((((__builtin_offsetof (struct malloc_chunk, fd_nextsize))+((2 *(sizeof(size_t))) - 1)) & ~((2 *(sizeof(size_t))) - 1))) && ((old_top)->size & 0x1) && ((unsigned long) old_end & pagemask) == 0)' failed.
Aborted
```

or the full coin code from the same page

```
solc FullCoinCode.sol 
*** Error in `solc': malloc(): memory corruption: 0x00000000006672c0 ***
Aborted
```

# dependencies

Perhaps boost is causing this?

    apt-cache showpkg libboost-dev

shows that I have version 1.55.0.2

# what to do?

Routes for me now:

1) installing a newer OS after wiping Debian Jessie :-(
2) using an older solidity compiler `solc` which is compatible with Debian Jessie - but which solidity version can guarantee that?
3) upgrading boost somehow (and without destroying my current system). How?
4) your suggestion ...

What would you do?

**Any hints? Please help - thanks!**

Thx @pirapira 

No hurries though; I have now created a VirtualBox machine based on ArchLinux - and in there -*hooray*- all ETH tools are working fine. 

If you solve this though, then thanks in the name of all Debian users  ;-)

And I tried to make a VirtualBox with Debian stable, and saw "do you disable UEFI secure boot?" and wondered if to proceed.

@drandreaskrueger @pirapira is this still an issue?
