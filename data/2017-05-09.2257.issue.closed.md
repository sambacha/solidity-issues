# [\#2257 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2257) `closed`: Unused function "successAssemble" in test file libjulia/Parser.cpp causes compile fail

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102482?v=4" width="50">[zigguratt](https://github.com/zigguratt) opened issue at [2017-05-09 20:35](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2257):

After doing the following:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git
cd solidity
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
I get this during the compilation process:
```
/root/solidity/test/libjulia/Parser.cpp:92:6: error: ‘bool dev::solidity::test::{anonymous}::successAssemble(const string&, bool)’ defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]
 bool successAssemble(string const& _source, bool _allowWarnings = true)
      ^
cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors
test/CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/build.make:854: recipe for target 'test/CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/libjulia/Parser.cpp.o' failed
make[2]: *** [test/CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/libjulia/Parser.cpp.o] Error 1
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:555: recipe for target 'test/CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [test/CMakeFiles/soltest.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:127: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
```
The problem seems to be this:
```
cc1plus: all warnings being treated as errors
```
So it fails even though it's just encountering an unused function. I managed to get around it by commenting out the function definition in Parser.cpp.
