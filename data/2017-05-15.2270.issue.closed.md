This information is missing from readthedocs: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format
I think this should belong here: http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html that was where I was looking for it as instructed in https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Solidity,-Docs-and-ABI/ , so I looked in history and found the 'ethereum natural specification format'
