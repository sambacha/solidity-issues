As observed in https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ethereum-free/solidity/build/1.0.3089 , when a PR is from an account without the write access to `ethereum/solidity` repository, the Appveyor test fails.

I think the tests should just skip the bytecode comparison in that case. it is still better to have compilation succeeding than ignoring the entire Windows platform for third party PRs.
