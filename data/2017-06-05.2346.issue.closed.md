# [\#2346 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2346) `closed`: Experimental mode
**Labels**: `enhancement`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2017-06-05 21:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2346):

An experimental mode could be introduce (turned on by `pragma experimental;`), which enables risky/unfinished/untested features (but still issues warnings for them).

This could enable a more rapid merging process, yet still not exposing users to risky code.
