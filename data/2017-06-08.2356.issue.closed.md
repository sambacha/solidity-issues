After binary search a la code deletion, I finally found what was causing my stack disturbance: casting an address as a contract and then incorrectly referencing variables in that contract (without parentheses). Putting the parens in fixes it, but it is hard to find in a larger contract, so maybe the compiler could give a more helpful response. Also, it's odd because function comparison doesn't seem to bother the compiler.  

contract B {

       uint public b;
       uint public c;
 }

contract A {

        function d() {

                B BB =  B(0);

                // the following works

                BB.b() < BB.c();

                // but this is disturbing

                BB.b < BB.c;

        }

}

I've spent a bit of time now poking around in the compiler, so if someone wants to give me a hint, I could tackle this one.

Thanks a lot, @illuzen ! The proper fix would be to disallow the comparison operator for function types. This is determined by the `binaryOperatorResult` function on the type classes (in `Types.h`). Currently, the default implementation in the Type base class is to allow comparison operators for all types. Most of the derived classes then again disallow it by returning the empty `TypePointer()` for that function (this signals that it is not possible).

I think a better default implementation would be to only allow it if `commonType(shared_from_this(), _other)` is non-null and is a value type.

By the way, it seems that the same bug is also present if you want to compare mappings.

Ah just pulled this up and saw that you've already grabbed. Will have to move faster next time.
