# [\#2468 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2468) `closed`: Modifiers are considered like public functions when they are always internal
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The following code doesn't compile.
```
contract Foo {
    struct S { }
    
    modifier mod(S storage x) {
        _;
    }
}
```
```
Error: Location has to be memory for publicly visible functions (remove the "storage" keyword).
    modifier mod(S storage x) {
                 ^---------^
```

Modifiers are always called internally and so it looks to me like this should be possible.

Thanks for reporting! I wonder whether we "introduced" this only lately by visiting function parameters in the type checker?

Ok, it was not added recently, therefore removing the "nextrelease" tag.
