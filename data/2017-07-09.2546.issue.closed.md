# [\#2546 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2546) `closed`: Feature request: Digit Separators

Can we have the ability to separate the digits in the solidity language. For example:

```solidity
uint256 number = 1,000,000;
uint256 number = 1 000 000;
uint256 number = 1_000_000;
```

The separators would not effect the compilation of the code and would only have meaning for anyone reading the codebase.

Thanks! This is tracked in issue #1677.
