# [\#2568 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2568) `closed`: How to get return data from a failing call

Is it possible that a contract written in Solidity calls another contract that fails, but gets the returned data?

* The recommended syntax `contract.method(arg0, arg1)` causes an exceptional halt when the callee fails.
* The lower level syntax `contract.call(something)` does not give access to the returned data.

Originally @dip239 asked me this question.

From my side this is tracked in #434.

Also the higher level part can be considered to be tracked by #1505.
