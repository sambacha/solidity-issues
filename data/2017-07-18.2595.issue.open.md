# [\#2595 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2595) `open`: Replace public with getter on state variables
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `language design :rage4:`

Replace the `public` keyword with `getter` on state variables to make the intent clearer.

Comments welcome whether this keyword is better or worse (or suggestions for better alternatives).

I don't think `getter` would be descriptive of an external call to a public function which initiates a TX.

I don't fully follow what "external call to a public function which initiates a TX" means?

Note, the "public" keyword is very misleading on functions too as it has a slightly different meaning to what "external" means and the ABI contains only methods which are available externally.

`public constant` are the getters but not `public` on it's own.

I am not entirely following, but no matter if it is `public constant` or `public`, only a getter will ever be generated.  The only difference is that a variable marked `constant` cannot be assigned to from within the code.

`public` on its own indicates state might change which is contrary to the concept of a getter.

Sorry, I still do not get what you are saying. Do you mean that a getter indicates that its value will never change?

So I guess I'm expressing the confusion you're trying to address, so I'll try unpack that....(Remininding myself that you're talking specifically of `public` state variables and not `public` functions)

Solidity, being an OOL using `public` in similar way to say C++ but,
`public` in C++ allows a class member to be viewed and changed externally from the instance.
`public` for a Solidity variable only exposes a `public constant` function getter but no setter.
`public` for a Solidity function generates an ABI, may mutate state unless `constant` is also used.

`uint public foo;` produces the equivalent abstract `function foo() public constant returns(uint);`
`uint public constant foo;` produces the same abstract function.
Thinking of both a `public` and `public constant` variables in terms of `public constant` function which is different to a `public` function is definitely a point of confusion.

The other issue ([#2633](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2633)) is that the equivalent abstract getter of a `public` variable is not recognised as implemented when that variable is declared in the deriving contract. So in order to have a consistent interface, the variable must be declared as private under a different name with an explicit getter function to implement the abstract interface.  This defeats the whole purpose of using `public` as a getter shortcut.  

So, that said (sorry for the all confusion), yes I agree `getter` would be a more suitable keyword for exposing variables through the ABI.  The declaration must also be recognised as the implementation of the getter functions abstract which may be declared in an interface.

In the past three years a lot has changed in the language, so the discussion above is slightly out of date:
- `constant` of function definitions is replaced with state-mutability (view/pure/...)
- `constant` of variables means constants (set at compile time) and `immutable` was introduced for set-once (during deployment) variables
- interfaces can not contain variables anymore, just functions describing what the interface does
- interfaces can't have `public` specifier anymore, just `external`
- "getters" can implement such interface functions, if their generated signature matches (e.g. `uint public a;` is valid to implement `function a() external view returns (uint);`) -- this is a tad bit confusing

Additionally people have expressed more confusion about `public` in general.

Given all the above, I think it makes even more sense to consider this change.

I just really don't like the word `getter`. Another option (maybe foolish) would be to allow `view` to serve the purpose of `getter`.
