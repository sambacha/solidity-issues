# [\#2632 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2632) `closed`: Warn / disallow gigantic storage arrays

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2017-07-26 08:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2632):

As explained in 
https://chriseth.github.io/notes/talks/safe_solidity/#/8
it can be dangerous to mix gigantic arrays in memory with mappings or other data structures. We should either disallow such arrays or warn about them. A complication is the fact that it might be possible to create a multi-dimensional array where each dimension stays below the safety limit, but the full array is again dangerous.
