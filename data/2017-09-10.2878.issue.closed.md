Hi

I am trying to install Solidity in RedHat, getting Z3 SMT solver NOT found.

errors:

```
~/solidity/build->cmake .. && make
CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake/EthPolicy.cmake:12 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0028 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

The actual error is that libboost-dev is not found. Could you try installing it? I fear that redhat does not provide a recent enough version of boost, though.

@chriseth we'd consider changing that informational message to be less frightening and/or more informational :)

I've got Gentoo with every possible library from boost 1.65.0, all with headers, source code and other things like Z3 meth solver. But I'm still getting not found boost_regex (it's everywhere in `/usr/include/boost/regex/(regex.hpp|regex_fwd.hpp|regex.h)`, boost_filesystem /usr/include/boost/filesystem* and that `Z3 SMT solver`, which is unsurprisingly in `/usr/include/z3/`

Closing this since our boost integration changed significantly since 2017.
