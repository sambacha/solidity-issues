Unit-tests for code should be as close as possible to the code to be tested. Furthermore, it should not be required to repeat common patters.

It might make sense to define a DSL or just a template for defining unit tests for Solidity contracts in the same source file, which are then compiled to javascript which uses testrpc or truffle as backend.
