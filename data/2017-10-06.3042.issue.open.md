> In some locations we use (x + 31) / 32 * 32 for rounding, but (x + 31) & ~31 should be a bit more efficient because it has only one constant.
> Also add that rule to the optimizer.

I don't think so.

`mul(div(add(x, 31), 32), 32)` -> `and(add(x, 31), not(31))`

Or are we thinking about a generic rule:
`mul(div(add(x, a), b), b)` -> `and(add(x, a), not(a))` where `b == a + 1`, `b >= 1`, and `b` is a power of 2?

could also be more generic
