# [\#3052 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3052) `closed`: Should the compiler raise visibility warnings for constructor functions?

I assume the visibility warnings are there to get developers thinking more about function visibilities to prevent future multi-sig-like hacks, etc.

Should there be one for constructor functions though?  I'm getting `No visibility specified` warnings in remix using `v0.4.17+commit.bdeb9e52.js` for all of my constructor functions.  I assume they can't be run more than once -- at deploy time and just searched the docs in case they can be, but didn't find anything.

Just found out the hard way that various deployment options will throw unrelated errors if constructor functions are marked `internal`. So perhaps the warning should say that?  Will look in the source to see if this is a simple string change.

The reason is explained in #2638 (also see #3132).

Do you have examples for any of these?

I'm closing this as a duplicate now, but if you do find examples where unrelated errors surface, please do reopen or create new issues for those.
