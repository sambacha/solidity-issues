3/5 Travis builds failed for PR #3054 for current develop branch https://travis-ci.org/ethereum/solidity/builds/285277486 where there were no changes that affect Travis.

The problem is with MongoDB repo:

	Err:22 http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu trusty/mongodb-org/3.2/multiverse i386 Packages
	  Empty files can't be valid archives
	  
	E: Failed to fetch store:/var/lib/apt/lists/partial/repo.mongodb.org_apt_ubuntu_dists_trusty_mongodb-org_3.2_multiverse_binary-i386_Packages  Empty files can't be valid archives
	E: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
