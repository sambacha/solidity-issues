# [\#3138 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3138) `open`: SMT Solver: Add modifer post-assertions as postconditions for functions
**Labels**: `feature`

When storage variables are tracked by the SMT solver, they have to be set to "unknown" after each non-view function call (even internal function call) because we currently do not know what that function will do. We can add a little insight by at least searching for modifiers without arguments and adding all assertions that appear after the `_` to the constraint set.
