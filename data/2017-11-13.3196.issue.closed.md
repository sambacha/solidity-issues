# Feature request: Add `constructor` modifier

## Problem

Solidity currently has no special syntax to distinguish a constructor from a function. A constructor is simply a function whose name equals that of the contract.

This introduces a dependence between the name of the contract and the constructor that is easily overlooked when refactoring code, and can have disastrous consequences: If the contract is renamed, but the constructor isn't, the constructor becomes a public function callable by anyone. This allows the state of the contract to be reset or modified by an adversary. There are examples of such a vulnerability in real-world contracts, e.g. in [the case of Rubixi](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/19/thinking-smart-contract-security/).
I have also encountered this issue during smart contract audits.

## Suggested solution

I suggest the following path for fixing this issue:

*In a first phase*, solidity should introduce a new `constructor` function modifier. The compiler should emit a warning when it encounters a constructor that does not carry the modifier. It should emit an error if it encounters a function that isn't a constructor but that carries the modifier. Here are some examples showing the desired behavior:

**No warning**
```
contract Foo {
   function Foo() constructor {
   }
}
```

**Warning**
```
contract Foo {
   function Foo() {
   }
}
```

**Error**
```
contract Bar {
   function Foo() constructor {
   }
}
```

*In a second phase*, use of the `constructor` modifier would be made mandatory, perhaps as part of the 0.5.0 release. Having a constructor without the `constructor` modifier would result in an error instead of a warning.

If anything, I'd rather prefer `constructor Foo()` then adding a modifier, because:
- `function` suggests the constructor can be executed multiple times (as `function` in every other case means that) and
- that having a modifier in today's language semantics would make someone look for the modifier body

@axic: My proposal above was meant to fix the issue with as little changes to the language as possible. I completely agree with you: If we can change the syntactic structure of the language, then having `constructor Foo() {...}` or even just `constructor () {...}` would definitely be nicer!

We could also go the C++/Java/C# route and just have `Foo () {...}`. 

Any option that ensures that renaming a contract will not accidentally turn a constructor into a function is good for me.

I like `constructor() { ... }`. We can do it in a backward-compatible way to ease migration and the result looks familiar to JavaScript developers.

As an aside, not sure if your preferred linter does this, but if it doesn't I would highly recommend writing a rule to ban all UpperCamelCase functions that are not the constructor. This, together with the rule for enforcing UpperCamelCase contract names should prevent you from making this particular mistake.

Adding a built in "modifier" called `constructor` would not be a breaking change due to horrible shadowing rules, but in my opinion it would be a bad decision in language design, especially if we wanted to move to a different syntax in 0.5.0 :)

I also prefer `constructor(...) {}`.

I strongly agree with this, I've many times changed the contract name and forgotten to change the constructor name, but as I was using a full IDE with solc-lint it just remembered "hey this function is not using camelCase".

This should also be linked to  #3185 where the LibraryContract should deploy the constructor method, instead of being simply run at creation and not stored.

This should not be too hard to do once we have the keyword. Anyone opposing to using `constructor(...){}`? What is the advantage of `constructor Foo() {...}` ?

I am not aware of any technical advantage of `constructor Foo() {...}` over `constructor(...){}`. I believe that this is mainly a matter of aesthetics.

Having said that, I personally prefer the D.R.Y. `constructor(...){}` syntax.

> What is the advantage of `constructor Foo() {...}` ?

The original proposal suggested `function Foo() constructor {}`, over that I quickly suggested to not use the modifier and have a keyword and had the example `constructor Foo() {}`, but nobody (including me) ever championed for keeping the contract name there :)

how can i input an address on constructor? I have added the function to my code to create tokens and now i want to be able to input a central mint address on the constructor's parameters

Better to ask the question on https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/ and be a bit more verbose.
