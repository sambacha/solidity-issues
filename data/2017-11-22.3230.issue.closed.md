It seems that the `appveyor.yml` contains private keys.
Maybe is a good idea to dettach them from github in some way.

They are currently required to push artifacts to a github repository. The keys are of course encrypted, but I agree that it is not ideal. Do you have any suggestions?

We could at least switch to a different account.

Remove all private keys from all CI (travis, AppVeyor) or at least switch to a different account.

This has been fixed with shutting down travis.
