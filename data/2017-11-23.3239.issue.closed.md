# [\#3239 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3239) `closed`: Bug in Blind Auction contract example

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1102173?v=4" width="50">[nikhil-tibrewal](https://github.com/nikhil-tibrewal) opened issue at [2017-11-23 02:18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3239):

Referencing: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/solidity-by-example.rst#blind-auction-1

The `auctionEnd()` says that:

```
        // We send all the money we have, because some
        // of the refunds might have failed.
        beneficiary.transfer(this.balance);
```
But this isn't correct right? What if the bidders haven't called `withdraw` yet? Any unclaimed ether would also go to the beneficiary? And in what scenarios would refunds fail? This is the first instance since the beginning of the Solidity docs where `failure` is brought up. Could this be elaborated further?

Thanks a lot for finding this! I think this is a remnant of an incomplete change to the withdraw pattern. Refunds cannot fail anymore here.

Just to add more info here, the new code transfers the highest bid instead of the contract balance.

```
       // 3. Interaction
        beneficiary.transfer(highestBid);
```
