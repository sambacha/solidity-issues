It would be useful to have a line number reference for the source code to know which portion of the code is not yet supported.

Definitely.  This is a really troubling condition to debug, especially when it occurs in relation to a storage type related context since you don't know if it's due to complex key being used in a public storage element, or as a parameter declaration problem in a function call or declaration, etc.:

UnimplementedFeatureError: Encoding type "struct EtherBandBattlesDataTypes.structPendingPaymentDetails memory" not yet implemented.

The original report is over a year old I see so bumping this one up.

@roschler Thanks for bringing this up again. Yes, this is a nice enhancement, but it would come with the cost of a small to medium-sized refactoring. Would anyone be willing to help with that?

This is tracked in #5161.
