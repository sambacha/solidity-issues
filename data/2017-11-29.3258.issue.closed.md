# [\#3258 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3258) `closed`: Warn when using `return(p, s)` assembly in non external functions.

When using assembly return it ends the call at the moment encounter this assembly return, so this type of return should be used carefully as its not as a regular solidity return (which ends the internal call), this one ends the whole call to the contract at that moment.

Example:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.10;


contract SystemA {

    event Test(bool);

    function testA() public {
        Test(TestReturns());
    }
    
    function TestReturns() public constant returns(bool) {
        assembly { 
            return(0,0)
        }

    }
    
}   
``` 

calling testA() will never fire the event Test.

While this is a good suggestion, such a warning could give a false impression of safety.

Assembly can do just about anything and there are many things that are not checked about assembly code.

The same applies to `require`, `assert`, `revert`, `throw` and `selfdestruct` in non-assembly.

This case is different. Most developers, specially the ones not aware of behavior of `assembly { return(p,s) } ` may assume that this return will return at internal function level, in the example is easy for make this misunderstand of behavior. 
I think that should be added some kind of warning for this case, maybe at "deep analysis", specially at "Low level calls: Semantics maybe unclear", only if the function using `return(p,s)` is not an external function.

`assembly` should only be used by those who have a very good understanding about the language. Since there is no way to disable warnings in the compiler, you'd need to add this feature to the static analyzer in Remix.

I agree that this should go to static analizer. 
BTW, Paritytech team did not noticed this, look:
https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/blob/657da22245dcfe0fe1cccc58ee8cd86924d65cdd/validator_contracts/interfaces/RelaySet.sol#L56

This function callls `getValidators()`, and passes the result of the function to an event called `FinalizeChange` but this function is using `return(p,s)`  so it will end execution there.
https://github.com/paritytech/contracts/blob/657da22245dcfe0fe1cccc58ee8cd86924d65cdd/validator_contracts/interfaces/RelaySet.sol#L59-L69

Perhaps we need another type of assembly return, return2(p,s) that does not end call but returns at internal call scope?

The "another type of assembly return" is assigning to the return variables directly from assembly.

Instead of `returndatacopy` + `return` it should write directly to the array: `returndatacopy(output_addresses, 0, returndatasize)` where `returns (address[])` is named as `output_addresses`. (assuming returndatacopy's first parameter is the output memory offset).

Closing issue to be addressed to specific "static analyzer tool"
