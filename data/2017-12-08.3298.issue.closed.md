# [\#3298 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3298) `closed`: LLL: simple way of retrieving runtime bytecode

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3036030?v=4" width="50">[veox](https://github.com/veox) opened issue at [2017-12-08 17:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3298):

I'm attempting to add LLL support to [Populus](https://github.com/ethereum/populus).

This requires three components to be available:

- [x] the ABI, which for now we'll be [providing "externally"](https://github.com/ethereum/populus/issues/400), via an `.lll.abi` file;
- [x] the (deployment?) bytecode, already available via `lllc -x /path/to/contract.lll`;
- [ ] runtime bytecode, as it will be present on-chain - currently unavailable.

Could `lllc` provide this, perhaps with dedicated CLI options, e.g. `-B` and `-X`?

...Or should I look into "stripping" the bytecode (given by `lllc -x`) in Populus itself?

I am not fully sure I understand this issue? What are the required new features for LLL here?

Output for the equivalent of `solc`'s `evm.deployedBytecode.object`.

I'll edit the OP to be clearer.

I've looked at [disassembly](https://gist.github.com/veox/5dcd70fc8486640237c233f7cbf15671) of a [simple LLL program](https://github.com/veox/populus/blob/e3e4adb12546cac7661643dc5b4dbc69c672e11d/tests/fixtures/Greeter.lll); and it does seem possible to just "strip" the bytecode with external tools, removing the `codecopy` head and `data` tail.

However, it might be useful if `lllc` could do this itself. (I've looked at `lllc`'s sources, too, and understood little.)

Why do you need the "runtime bytecode"?

`populus deploy` tests if a contract's code post-deployment matches that given by the compiler.

(Actually, I'll go ask if there's any other reason.)

Because there's no way for `lllc` to give you it. It has no concept of creation and deployed bytecodes. The LLL source code is just like assembly, it has no restrictions. The example you've found happens to do this, but it is not a requirement presented by the compiler.

Thank you for the clarification. Closing.
