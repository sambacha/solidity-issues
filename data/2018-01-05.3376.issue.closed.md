**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Install instructions at http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installing-solidity.html includes many install options. The first recommendation is:

    npm install -g solc

The usage instructions are at http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/using-the-compiler.html and begin with:

    solc

----

If you buy a new Mac, then install and run Xcode, per instructions, and then run those two commands you will get:

> command not found: solc

Please note the text above the `npm install` command which reads:

> It also contains a commandline tool called solcjs, which can be installed via npm:
> npm install -g solc

It mentions that the installed tool will be called `solcjs`. It may be a bit confusing - do you have any suggestions to improve the wording? A pull request would be welcome if you are interested.
