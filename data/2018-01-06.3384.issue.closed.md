# [\#3384 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3384) `closed`: Improve instruction semantics helpers

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-01-06 01:15](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3384):

See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3352/files#r158486039.

`libevasm/Instruction.*` and `libevasm/SemanticInformation.cpp` has a lot of semi-overlapping definitions which could be simplified and subsequently ensuring it is easier to follow.
