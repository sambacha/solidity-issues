Public arrays, such as
```
contract A {
    uint256[] public allTimestamps;
}
```
are more useful if you can know their lengths. I have been creating public length getter methods, like
```
function timestampCount() {
    return allTimestamps.length;
}
```
but it would be preferable for either the default behavior or some function modifier to do this automatically.

Also, we as a community should agree on a naming standard for array length accessors.
