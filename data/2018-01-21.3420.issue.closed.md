Interfaces have extremely limited utility and only academic use in real-world scenarios. While working on standardizing an interface, several shortcomings are apparent:

* Interfaces handle implicit getters differently than contracts https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411
* Interfaces do not reason well about state mutability https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3412
* Interfaces can't inherit https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3419
* Interfaces don't allow default implementations https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3411

---

To recognize the problem, see that none of the draft ERCs https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/ are using `interface` to specify their standards. Instead, they resort to using functions inlined in markdown. And the functions are not even correct (missing public or other warnings). Clearly `interface` is not filling the needs of today's ERC writers.

# Solution

Completely scrap the way `interface` keyword is understood. Here is the new definition of `interface`:

> An interface is identical to a contract in all ways except that a) an interface cannot inherit from a contract and b) you cannot compile an interface.

Such a definition would be immediately useful and simpler to explain than the current mechanism.

Additional work:

- [x] Create metadata for abstract contracts: #3437

I no longer think this is the correct solution to the interface problem. But I'll keep this issue open until the language redesign is complete as a reminder of the current inconsistencies.

Closing here. Those others issues that need to be open are open.

And there is an Inheritance Manifest https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3729#issuecomment-429987588 which is a better collection of issues.
