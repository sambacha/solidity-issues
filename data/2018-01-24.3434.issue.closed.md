# [\#3434 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3434) `closed`: Doc repository

Can we separate the doc to a new repository? 

This will make it much easier to do translation and keep the translation in sync with the main repo.

Can you please expand how a separate repository helps having translations in sync?

Two benefits we have for having documentation in this repo:
- all examples can be compiled with every change, ensuring they never break
- new features/changes can be merged to documentation the same time the change is applied to code

Okay, thanks for answering. 

Here is what I am trying to achieve:
1. Git clone a **doc** repository and set up a Chinese translation site
2. Closely watch changes of the **doc**  and do the Chinese translation accordingly.

With current repository(doc + source code), I will get a lot of noise. Meaning a lot of changes have nothing to do with translation.

Hope that answers the question.

It is possible to see the commit log for specific directories. For example this shows relevant commits for the `docs` directory: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commits/develop/docs

I think that should be enough to accomplish what you need.
