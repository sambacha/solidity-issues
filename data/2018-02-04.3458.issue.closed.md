# Discussion

Currently, `interface` is meant to track ABI (again, I hate this word choice). Here is a contract that demonstrates `public` and `external` functions do have identical ABI:

```solidity

contract MathABITest {
    function a() external pure {
    }
    function b() public pure {
    }
}
```

And the ABI calculated by Solidity is:

```json
[
	{
		"constant": true,
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "b",
		"outputs": [],
		"payable": false,
		"stateMutability": "pure",
		"type": "function"
	},
	{
		"constant": true,
		"inputs": [],
		"name": "a",
		"outputs": [],
		"payable": false,
		"stateMutability": "pure",
		"type": "function"
	}
]
```

Therefore, a contract that uses an `public` or `external` function should be compatible with an interface that requires an `external` function.

# Test case

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

interface Math {
    function calculateMostCommonNumberInSolidityDocumentation() external returns (int);
}

contract MathImplementation is Math {
    function calculateMostCommonNumberInSolidityDocumentation() public returns (int) {
        return 69;
    }
}
```

This should produce no error. But currently the error is:

> TypeError: Overriding function visibility differs.

Sorry I posted here, but it should have been #3412.

<summary>OLD COMMENT</summary>
Also can we please evaluate if this test case should pass or fail:

# Test case 1

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

interface Math {
    function calculateMostCommonNumberInSolidityDocumentation() external payable returns (int);
}

contract MathImplementation is Math {
    function calculateMostCommonNumberInSolidityDocumentation() external returns (int) {
        return 69;
    }
}
```

# Test case 2

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.20;

interface Math {
    function calculateMostCommonNumberInSolidityDocumentation() external returns (int);
}

contract MathImplementation is Math {
    function calculateMostCommonNumberInSolidityDocumentation() external payable returns (int) {
        return 69;
    }
}
```

# Discussion

In the discussion of the deed/NFT/DAR standard https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/841 we have specified which functions are payable and which are not. The 0x team argues that it is not in scope for a standard (an interface) to specify whether functions are payable.

I think this discussion has wider applicability in the Solidity ecosystem so I have brought it here.

I think the current specific rule in the code is that a contract implementing an interface may not modify  the state mutability level of a function.

State mutability is defined as ([the only summary](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html?highlight=payable#json) - there is also another suggestion to [move selfdestruct into another state mutability level](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3221)):

> stateMutability: a string with one of the following values:
> - pure (specified to not read blockchain state),
> - view (specified to not modify the blockchain state),
> - nonpayable (cannot accept value transfers) and
> - payable (can accept value transfers).

Above the state mutability level is increasing from pure (nothing) to payable (everything).

What are the reasons proposed for disregarding the payable keyword for interfaces?

Coming back to the initial proposal again: I think it should not be an error if a public function overrides an external function. The requirement for interface functions to be external makes their use extremely annoying. Because of that, I think this should be part of 0.5.0.
