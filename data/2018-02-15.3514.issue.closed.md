**Labels**: `feature`, `annoys users :cry:`

# Test case

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

interface I {
    function bob() external returns (int);
}

contract C is I {
    int public bob;
}
```

# Current outcome

> This contract does not implement all functions and thus cannot be created.

# Expected outcome

Compiles successfully

# Discussion

Getter functions are defined in the documentation at http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters:

> The compiler automatically creates getter functions for all public state variables.

In contract `C`, the implicit function `function bob() external returns (int);` is generated for the public variable `int public bob;`. Therefore the contract should be a valid implementation of the interface.

I fear we need a centralized point where we discuss how function inheritance is supposed to work in the future.

Good point. In the Swift Evolution process, this would call for a manifesto. We could call it the Inheritance Manifesto. This would document what is going changing, the motivation and how to make the new behavior self-consistent.

If would like me to do this, maybe we could have a quick phone call. This will let me understand what type of end product would be accepted.

Well as a first step we should collect all the relevant issue numbers in one place. There are probably close to 10 issues talking about different facets of inheritance.

@fulldecent I created a project https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects/9 - not sure if you can add items there, but if you tell me, I will add them.

Interested to know the status of this as I seem to be getting some inconsistent behaviour between ~0.4.24 and 0.5.xx

@alsco77  This discussion is now rolled into https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3729

This issue can be closed when the conclusion is reached, wherever that discussion happens.
