Hi. I'm trying to build the compiler from source by following the steps found here: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source

However, I'm running into an error during compilation. The repository is at commit f4aa05f308ef6b with no additional changes. These are the exact commands I ran:
 
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git
$ cd solidity/
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ ./scripts/install_deps.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. && make
```

This is the error I'm getting:
```
/home/ealmansi/dev/zeppelin/docgen/solc/solidity/libjulia/optimiser/SimplificationRules.cpp:44:91:   required from here
/usr/include/boost/variant/get.hpp:229:5: error: static assertion failed: boost::variant does not contain specified type U, call to boost::get<U>(const boost::variant<T...>&) will always throw boost::bad_get exception
     BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG(
^
```

Full output: https://gist.github.com/ealmansi/310f4f5ca98822c4d2934bc30f516845

Environment:
```
Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
cmake version 3.5.1
GNU Make 4.1
g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.6) 5.4.0 20160609
```

I'm not sure if this is something related to my environment, but it might be a general problem since v0.14.19 compiles just fine on my system. Any help is welcome.

**Update**: Some collective knowledge from the interwebs led me to a solution, but I don't have personal experience so as to judge whether the solution is reasonable or somewhat of a hack.

I added the following line in file `libjulia/optimiser/SimplificationRules.h`, right after `#pragma once` and compilation went ahead just fine:

```
#define BOOST_VARIANT_USE_RELAXED_GET_BY_DEFAULT
```
