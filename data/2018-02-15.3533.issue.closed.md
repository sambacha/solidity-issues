# [\#3533 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3533) `closed`: CI builds should only be triggered, if sources where changed

Currently the CI builds are triggered, also if only documentation was changed. At least travis builds are  super slow, probably that could help to get faster feedback from CI.

I'm not sure about this. We should instead have good caching so that builds are fast. Sometimes, it is important to have a full run on the change because the CI run also creates binaries and might deploy them somewhere. If that doesn't work, we might be completely stuck on e.g. a release.

I think the better way forward would be to move as much as possible away from travis. Circle seems to be much faster and also better with caching.

@chriseth @axic From my point of view this issue can be closed.
