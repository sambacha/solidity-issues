# [\#3557 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3557) `open`: Add more tests for jsoncpp's strict mode
**Labels**: `help wanted`, `good first issue`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-02-20 21:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3557):

Apparently these features are turned on strict mode:
```
  (*settings)["allowComments"] = false;
  (*settings)["strictRoot"] = true;
  (*settings)["allowDroppedNullPlaceholders"] = false;
  (*settings)["allowNumericKeys"] = false;
  (*settings)["allowSingleQuotes"] = false;
  (*settings)["stackLimit"] = 1000;
  (*settings)["failIfExtra"] = true;
  (*settings)["rejectDupKeys"] = true;
  (*settings)["allowSpecialFloats"] = false;
```

```
    Available settings (case-sensitive):
    - `"collectComments": false or true`
      - true to collect comment and allow writing them
        back during serialization, false to discard comments.
        This parameter is ignored if allowComments is false.
    - `"allowComments": false or true`
      - true if comments are allowed.
    - `"strictRoot": false or true`
      - true if root must be either an array or an object value
    - `"allowDroppedNullPlaceholders": false or true`
      - true if dropped null placeholders are allowed. (See StreamWriterBuilder.)
    - `"allowNumericKeys": false or true`
      - true if numeric object keys are allowed.
    - `"allowSingleQuotes": false or true`
      - true if '' are allowed for strings (both keys and values)
    - `"stackLimit": integer`
      - Exceeding stackLimit (recursive depth of `readValue()`) will
        cause an exception.
      - This is a security issue (seg-faults caused by deeply nested JSON),
        so the default is low.
    - `"failIfExtra": false or true`
      - If true, `parse()` returns false when extra non-whitespace trails
        the JSON value in the input string.
    - `"rejectDupKeys": false or true`
      - If true, `parse()` returns false when a key is duplicated within an object.
    - `"allowSpecialFloats": false or true`
      - If true, special float values (NaNs and infinities) are allowed 
        and their values are lossfree restorable.
```

Have a look at `test/libdevcore/JSON.cpp` and extend the test suite to cover these cases.

@axic Mind if I run with this issue?  I haven't had a chance to dig into the test suite yet.

@AnthonyBroadCrawford please work ahead! Let us know on gitter if you run into any issues. These test should go into `tests/libdevcore/JSON.cpp`.

@axic Awesome, thank you.

Is this still open? I'm looking for something to start contributing to open source with!

@kennycastro007 This issue would be obsolete/solved, if we go ahead with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6900, but we haven't decided that yet - I'll bring it up during our meeting later today and we'll get back to you regarding a good issue to start with!
