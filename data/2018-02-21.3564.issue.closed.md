It seems there are people willing to do the translation, it just lacks organisation.

Shall we try to ping them once more? I fear that we need some person properly in charge for the translations.

@AdrianClv - we would like to try again perhaps with some more guidance and project management, @ChrisChinchilla is willing to coordinate.

@chriseth It's ok. I can transfer the ownership of the repo to someone else if he is willing to work on it.

We are currently working on a new, hopefully more structured workflow for the Solidity docs translations. I will ping you once this is ready. Closing this issue for now, you can track the progress of the new process etc. in issue #10119.
