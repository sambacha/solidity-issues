# [\#3598 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3598) `closed`: Please remove "brew update" in the install_deps.sh script. 

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20894110?v=4" width="50">[pinnaclesystemsgroup](https://github.com/pinnaclesystemsgroup) opened issue at [2018-02-26 06:14](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3598):

The use of the "brew update" command in the install_deps.sh script should be changed to only update dependencies for this repo, and not the user's entire installed brew package library as the current install script does now. The wholesale update of user's package library risks breaking other applications and development chains in the user's target system as a result which may depend on specific "outdated" brew packages which the user has intentionally chosen not to update.

I guess this is the same issue as #3592 ?

Alex

I don't wish to send you down the wrong path with my issue. Simply, the
install_dep.sh script invokes brew update against the target systems
package library instead of selectively updating and installing just the
packages that are required  ....

Thanks
