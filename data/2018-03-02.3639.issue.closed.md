# [\#3639 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3639) `closed`: Random Yul code generator

## Abstract

Valid YUL code needs to be generated for testing purposes.

## Motivation

There are two ways to do this

[Low effort] Use a fuzzer with existing yul code samples for code generation. The benefit is that this is very little work, the disadvantage is that yul code generated semi-randomly may not even be parseable. This means that we won't be able to test deeper portions of the YUL compiler/optimizer.

[High effort] Write a grammar for yul [1] and write a protobuf-based-libfuzzer yul generator [2] to stress test the optimizer. The main advantage compared to the purely coverage guided yul generation approach is that the yul generator is probably more likely to be parseable and can hence test deeper portions of the program.

A first MVP could be the following:
 - variable declarations
 - assignments
 - restricted set of built-in functions (EVM opcodes)
 - variable references
 - constants

Variables can only be referenced if they have been defined before. This means the first statement has to be a variable declaration.

The set of opcodes to use could be: add, sub, mul, div, eq, lt, gt, mstore, mload, sstore, sload

There is an initial version of this in #3846.
