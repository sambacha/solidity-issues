**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/95daeac939785d61e4ea97a789c595705add485d#r27887648.

Parser workarounds are present now:
- `emit`
- `constructor`
- `constant` on functions

Also the CLI has `--strict-assembly` which will be removed in 0.5.0 since #3527 deprecates the non-strict version.
