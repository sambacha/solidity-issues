Since the function's scope is only set after the NameAndTypeResolution phase, its default visibility is only known at that point. While that is still before the TypeChecker needs the visibility, it might no be worth the hassle and thus we could just keep it like that.

@chriseth 

Is there not a use case for defining, in an interface, that a `public view` should exist?

I get compiler warnings when doing this.
