Source:[https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/contracts.rst#fallback-function](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/contracts.rst#fallback-function)
_Contract.rc: In such a context, there is usually very little gas available to the function call (to be precise, 2300 gas), so it is important to make fallback functions as cheap as possible._

I think here is confusing. 2300 gas only applied when this fall back is called from a message call. you can actually specify gas limit if you can a fallback function by a transaction call.
