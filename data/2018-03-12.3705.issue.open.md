# [\#3705 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3705) `open`: Allow functions with the name matching the contract (0.6.0)
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

Follow up of #3196.

With the introduction of the `constructor` keyword we are deprecating functions named the same as the contract. They will be rejected in 0.5.0.

After a while when the ecosystem has moved on, we could consider removing that extra corner case rejecting special function names (such as the one matching the contract name).

Since compiling old code with a new compiler would not generate a warning but severely changes the semantics with security holes in practically any such contract, I would strongly advise against allowing that even in 5 years time.

When this issue was created, the following code was handled by a special case in the compiler:
```solidity
contract C {
  function C() external {}
}
```

Since around 0.6.0 when shadowing rules were strengthened/introduced, we get the following:
```solidity
Error: Functions are not allowed to have the same name as the contract. If you intend this to be a constructor, use "constructor(...) { ... }" to define it.
 --> 3705.sol:2:3:
  |
2 |   function C() external {}
  |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Warning: Source file does not specify required compiler version!
--> 3705.sol

Warning: This declaration shadows an existing declaration.
 --> 3705.sol:2:3:
  |
2 |   function C() external {}
  |   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: The shadowed declaration is here:
 --> 3705.sol:1:1:
  |
1 | contract C {
  | ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

I would argue we do not need the special case anymore, and we can just rely on the shadowing warning.
