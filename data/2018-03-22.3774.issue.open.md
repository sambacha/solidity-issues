# [\#3774 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3774) `open`: Consider support homebrew better and pushing bottles every release
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

Bottle is a prebuilt homebrew package. Currently our homebrew is source only, it will be compiled every single time at the users' computer.

Implementation for bottles: https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum/pull/119

What is required here is building it for different (or at least that last macOS release) in our release tooling. This requires a CI which runs macOS properly.
