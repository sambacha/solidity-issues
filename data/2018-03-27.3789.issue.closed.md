# [\#3789 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3789) `closed`: Deprecate multi-arg functions taking anything apart from bytes

Since we now have the `abi.` collection of encoding functions, we should deprecate the use of `call`, `callcode`, `delegatecall`, `sha3` and potentially other functions that take arbitrary number of arguments and just allow their versions that take a single `bytes` argument.

Fixed by #4097.
