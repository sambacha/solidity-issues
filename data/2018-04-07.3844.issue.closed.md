# [\#3844 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3844) `closed`: What is the unit of time functions on smart contract

#### <img src="(unknown)" width="50">[(unknown)]((unknown)) opened issue at [2018-04-07 21:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3844):

Hello guys,

I really confused what is the unit of airBegintime, airEndtime, icoBegintime and icoEndtime in contract address? Are they millisecond? And how these functions work?

Can someone inform me, please?

Here the contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c37188945c02818f09c7650093befcaa4085127#code

Here the functions:
---
airBegintime = 1520312400;
airEndtime = 1609390800;
---
icoBegintime = 1520312400;
icoEndtime = 1924923600;
---

I don't see any way to improve the documentation: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/units-and-global-variables.html?highlight=time#time-units

This is the first hit if you search for time.
