I've been working on several issues, that would benefit from a general compile-time pure expression evaluator.

This includes #3877, #3522, as well as expressions used for array lengths.

The main reason against a general compile-time evaluator for such expressions would be its complexity and the danger of introducing errors in it.

The main reasons for such an evaluator are that it would be a powerful analysis tool, that it would enable additional features like array lengths resulting from calling pure functions and that it could be used as an early optimizer step.

Note that for the existing evaluator, we already have a representation of the run-time value at compile time (RationalNumberType), which is not the case for anything else.
