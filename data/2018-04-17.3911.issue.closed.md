Found by @yann300.

```
contract test {
    uint a;
    constructor () {
        a = 5;
    }
    function test () {
        a = 10;
    }
}
```

The above should raise an error of two constructors declared. Currently it compiles without warnings and whichever constructor was declared first takes precedence (the other is just ignored).

Oh I'm sorry, confused this because I was working on both.
