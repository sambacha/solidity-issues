# [\#3983 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3983) `closed`: Delegatecall not working in some cases

Hey,

I used the following example contracts in Remix:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.17;

contract SomeContract {
    event CallMeMaybeEvent(address _from);
    function callMeMaybe() payable public {
        CallMeMaybeEvent(this);
    }
}

contract ThatCallsSomeContract {
    function callTheOtherContract(address _contractAddress) public {
        require(_contractAddress.call(bytes4(keccak256("callMeMaybe()"))));
        require(_contractAddress.delegatecall(bytes4(keccak256("callMeMaybe()"))));
        SomeLib.calledSomeLibFun();
    }
}

library SomeLib {
    event CalledSomeLibEvent(address _from);
    function calledSomeLibFun() public {
        CalledSomeLibEvent(this);
    }
}
```

(source: https://vomtom.at/address-call-vs-delegatecall-vs-libraries/)

When I select any compiler before 0.4.20 it will generate 3 events (if you call `ThatCallsSomeContract.callTheOtherContract` with the address of `SomeContract`). If I choose 0.4.20 or a newer compiler I don't have any event output.

I used the JavaScript VM of Remix to execute these calls.

EDIT: The transaction actually fails (somehow didn't see that in remix) ... still not sure why.

Sorry ... too late ... missed the library call change ... issue can be closed.

What do you mean by library call change?

I assume it was 
```
Code Generator: Prevent non-view functions in libraries from being called
directly (as opposed to via delegatecall).
```
but not exactly sure anymore, too long ago. If you want I can try to reproduce my issue :D 

EDIT: I cannot reproduce the issue :/ not sure what happened there :(

No, that shouldn't apply here. It is still called via `SomeLib.calledSomeLibFun();` so the compiler will use `delegatecall`.
