# [\#3998 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3998) `closed`: String memory variable cause function to return no value

I'm writing a simple smart contract which loops over internal array and checks if strings are equal. It compiles fine but when I run this smart contract I get no value at all. I started my investigation and here is what I have found.

Consider following smart contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract Season {
    address[] public requests;
    mapping(bytes32 => address) requestIdToAddress;
        
    function createRequest(string id) public {
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(id);
        require(requestIdToAddress[hash] == 0);

        Request request = new Request(id);
        requests.push(request);
        requestIdToAddress[hash] = request;
    }

    function getRequestsCount() public view returns(uint) {
        return requests.length;
    }

    function getRequestById(string id) public view returns(address) {
        return getRequestByHash(keccak256(id));
    }

    function getRequestByHash(bytes32 hash) public view returns(address) {
        return requestIdToAddress[hash];
    }

    function getRequestsByFilter(string id) public view returns(uint, uint, uint, bytes32[]) {
        bytes32[] memory filteredRequests = new bytes32[](getRequestsCount());
        uint j = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < filteredRequests.length; i++) {
            Request request = Request(requests[i]);
            //string memory requestId = request.id();
        }
        return (filteredRequests.length, getRequestsCount(), j, filteredRequests);
    }    
}

contract Request {
    string public id;

    constructor(string id_) public {
        id = id_;
    }
}
```

Deploy it and call `createRequest(somevalue)`. Then call  `getRequestsByFilter(anyvalue)` and you should see `1 1 1 0x00..00`. Ok, it's good, it works fine.

However, try to uncomment `//string memory requestId = request.id();` line and repeat steps above. In this case this contract is still compiling, however trying to call it always leads to `0 0 0 null`. But this line shouldn't change observable behaviour?! Yes, it shouldn't, however, it does.

I consider it's either VM or compiler bug.

Are you sure you are running this on a byzantium-compatible blockchain?

I run it on parity. However, it seems just an error because of trying to access other's contract dynamic string method. However, It doesn't work with sized types too:

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

contract Season {
    address[] public requests;

    constructor() public {
        requests.push(new Request());
    }

    function getRequestsByFilter() public view returns(bool) {
        Request r = Request(requests[0]);
        bool ret = r.isMatch();
        return ret;
    }
}

contract Request {  
    function isMatch() public pure returns(bool) {
        return true;
    }    
}
```

Here expected value is `true` but it's actually `false`.

I'm not sure anymore if it's a compiler bug or just bad EVM, but I think we need at least some explanation here, like some warning or something.

I have found out that it's parity bug, others ethereum implementations works fine with this code.

You can link to the Parity issue? It is useful for others finding this issue to be able to track what's going on.

Of course: https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/8503

It basically forbids any interacton between contracts, e.g. in provided example you cannot call `id()` function.

Related to #4259.
