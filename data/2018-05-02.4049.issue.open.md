**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4017 - we should add tests that would detect storage layout changes.

Tests could set some storage values and then use inline assembly to read at fixed points in storage (where we expect the changes to happen).

Tests should include:
 - (multiple) inheritance
 - constants
 - mappings
 - arrays
 - structs
 - packed data
