# [\#4061 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4061) `closed`: Fixed point type fractional digit limit

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-05-04 02:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4061):

Currently the limit is set at maximum 80 digits, that means the largest number representable would be
`0.999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999` in the `ufixed256x80` type, while the largest number fitting 256 bits is `115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936`.

`999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999`
is larger than
`115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936`

It actually requires 266 bits (`log2(pow(10, 80) - 1)`). I think the proper limit is 77 digits.

Not to mention signed fixed point, where an extra bit must be reserved for the sign.

Raised in the course of #3389 while discussing conversions.
Possible issue: this could overflow a u256 of `10^(abs(from - to))`, causing issues with conversions.
Concerns raised in Gitter:
 - Consider making it 76 instead instead of (possibly confusing) change based on signed or unsigned.
 - Consider making max number of decimal places lower based on number of bits such that 1 is always in range.

Could you please clarify what "it" mean? Is this about limiting the number of fractional digits in general, or depending on the bit size?

Sorry, yes I mean the limit on fractional digits by `it`.
