# [\#4066 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4066) `closed`: Improve error message for lookup in function types
**Labels**: `feature`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-05-04 10:36](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4066):

We should add a suggestion "did you intend to call the function" (or something like that) to the error message "member not found after argument-dependant lookup in type ..." in case the type is a function.

Potentially while implementing this, the bugs in #4156 might be fixed.
