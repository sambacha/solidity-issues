Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2691#issuecomment-386903299

Users often do not know that you cane suppress an "unused variable" warning by commenting out the name of the variable:

`function f(uint /* _x */, uint y) { g(y); }`

We should suggest that in the warning message.

The current warning message already suggest to comment out the unused variable:

```
Unused function parameter. Remove or comment out the variable name to silence this warning.
```

see:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/StaticAnalyzer.cpp#L85

Should we add this `function f(uint /* _x */, uint y) { g(y); }` to the warning?
