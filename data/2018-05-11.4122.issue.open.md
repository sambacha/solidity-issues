Does it cost any gas to cast a bytes32 memory value to uint256?  What is the assembly op code for this?

Does it cost more gas to use =, >, <. operators with bytes32 than it does with uint256?

Spreadsheets about gas costs say it cost 3 gas for =, >, < operations, so is that true with all types that support those operators?  Or is the gas cost for these operators different depending on the type?

I tested some of these things in remix and got mixed results -- sometimes it cost more gas, sometimes less.

Does it make any sense to cast bytes32 to unint256 for doing an operation like this: `require(uint256(myvalue) != 0);`

If you know the answers to these, can you please tell me how you know?

In general, `bytes32` and `uint256` are mostly equivalent with regards to gas and I'm actually surprised you got different results. Did you change the function signature somewhere?

Yes, my two test functions have different names.

From my investigation it seems that there is a gas cost to cast a value if the cast changes the size of the value.

For instance casting bytes32 to uint256 does not cost gas because they are the same size.  I wish there were a list of rules about these things somewhere that was easy to read.

Using an operator such as =,>,< will cost more gas if a cast needs to happen for the operation to occur and the cast causes one of the arguments to change size.

Yes, some guidelines about the costs of various types should be added to the documentation.

@chriseth , I had to have a few things debriefed:
Like,
 - [ ] : Type of format for `/docs`
e.g., Jekyll, Pandoc, rtm, PDF, html, etc.
 - [ ] : Level of detailing:
e.g.: I'm planning on covering all opcodes, with child --heads on each `/dataType`.
Also, what all are the checkboxes I must tick?

My basic reference is the spresdsheet .[1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m89CVujrQe5LAFJ8-YAUCcNK950dUzMQPMJBxRtGCqs/edit) from the wikipedia footnotes on its `eth` page.
i.e. .[30](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-gas-fuel-and-fees-3333e17fe1dc), .[32](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/29/homestead-release/), and the one tagged in this issue.

Anything , or everything else you'd want me to know?
Any better citations, sources?
Also, my  /ETA for the `v0.0.1` draft shall be `100,000`secs, from now.

@itsN1X this was more meant to be a high level description of the tradeoffs of different types with respect to gas, and not a detailed table with costs per opcode (although that could also be beneficial), since users usually do not know how they code is translated into opcodes (and I guess this is also where most confusion with regards to gas comes from).

Oh and please don't use the spreadsheet but for example an implementation of a compliant client or the yellowpaper.
