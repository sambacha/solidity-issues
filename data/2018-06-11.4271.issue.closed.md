# [\#4271 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4271) `closed`: File names and line numbers for exceptions in ``isoltest``.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2018-06-11 22:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4271):

Came up in #4064.

``isoltest`` should try to extract file names and line numbers from boost exceptions.
Also: ``<no message provided>`` should be used instead of ``NONE`` for empty comment tags.

EDIT: changing to ``boost::diagnostic_information`` altogether is better than changing to ``<no message provided>`` and extracting file names and line numbers manually.
