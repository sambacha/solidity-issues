- This should list all the directories and their duties.
- Should explain the high level flow of the compiler.
- Should go into detail on specific parts (e.g. optimiser, using yul in `ABIEncoderV2`, etc.)

This could be a section in the contributors guide or be a chapter on its own linked from the contributors guide. The contributors section already explains testing and fuzzing.
