# [\#4292 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4292) `closed`: Events with memory structs are encoded incorrectly
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
contract c {
    struct S { uint a ; uint b; }
    event E(S);
    function f() {
        emit E(S(1, 2));
    }
}
```
I was not able to verify this fully, but it causes a bug in Remix and I think the event just stores the memory location of the struct. It should not be possible to use this at all in pre-ABIEncoderV2.

Same goes for `indexed` structs.

Please check if his works properly with ABIEncoderV2 and `indexed`.
