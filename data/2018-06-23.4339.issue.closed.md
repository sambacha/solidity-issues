In the section [https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/frequently-asked-questions.html#what-happens-to-a-struct-s-mapping-when-copying-over-a-struct](url), there is a typo.

> In this case, the mapping of the struct being copied over into the userList is ignored as there is no “list of mapped keys”. Therefore it is not possible to find out which values should be copied over.

Should read:
> In this case, the mapping of the struct being copied over into **user2** is ignored as there is no “list of mapped keys”. Therefore it is not possible to find out which values should be copied over.

@axic and @lawrnce I'm going through the FAQ as part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1219 right now, so will fix it as part of that issue if that's OK?
