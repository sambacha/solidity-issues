# [\#4357 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4357) `closed`: new bytes overallocates memory, causing unneeded gas waste

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2888248?v=4" width="50">[D-Nice](https://github.com/D-Nice) opened issue at [2018-06-26 20:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4357):

It seems when using `new bytes`, an order of magnitude more memory is allocated than is actually needed for the specified length. 

Please refer to the following example, where A profiles current cost, B profiles expected cost, and C profiles current cost with the asm equivalent of what I think solidity is doing under the hood.

```
contract memoryProfiler {
    function A() returns (uint r) {
        new bytes(128);
        assembly {
            r: = msize
        }
        // returns 4256 for msize
        // 1224 gas used
    }
    
    function B() returns (uint r) {
        newBytesProper(128);
        assembly {
            r: = msize
        }
        // returns 288 for msize
        // 321 gas used        
    }
    
    function C() returns (uint r) {
        newBytesNative(128);
        assembly {
            r: = msize
        }
        // returns 4224 for msize
        // 1139 gas used
    }
    
    // approximate expected action
    function newBytesProper(uint _len) returns (uint o) {
        assembly {
            let f := mload(0x40)
            codecopy(f, codesize, add(_len, 0x20))
            mstore(f, _len)
            o := f
            mstore(0x40, msize)
        }
    }
    
    // approximation of what solidity does
    function newBytesNative(uint _len) returns (uint o) {
        assembly {
            let f := mload(0x40)
            // native appears to mul 0x20 rather than just adding
            // the extra length slot?
            codecopy(f, codesize, mul(_len, 0x20))
            mstore(f, _len)
            o := f
            mstore(0x40, msize)
        }
    }
}
```

As the comment under the `newBytesNative` function states, it appears that solc erroneously multiplies the length slot, rather than adding. With the offending line of code likely being here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blame/dc5cd3e1e7db933493fe1b0dc12e5ecdf2a50ed7/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp#L522

What version are you using? There was a bug like this which has been fixed.

Any I've tried, which was quite a few, including early ones, so it appeared that all 0.4.* were affected. The ones I can vouch for sure which I just tested are 0.4.24 stable and the 0.4.25 nightly that's most recent of today.

The latest nightly still has this issue. Would be nice to see this fixed before 0.5 release.

The bug was introduced with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/6777f7a57fed6b39128773f13084da729dd64588. I will fix it right away! Thanks a lot for finding and reporting!

@axic the old bug was that the free memory pointer was advanced too much, here, "only" `msize` gets too large.
