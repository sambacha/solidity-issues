# [\#4416 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4416) `closed`: Empty var assignments should also be disallowed.

The following code should now (with 0.5.0) generate an error, but currently does not even emit a warning:
```
contract C { function f() { var () = g(); } function g() {} }
```
It seems it has slipped through the removal of ``var`` so far, probably because it does not entail an actual variable declaration.

@christianparpart do you want to look into that as well, since you handled ``var`` so far? If not, I can look into it as well.

I can take that.

Pretty much the same thing happens for this case:
```
contract C {
  function f() public pure {
    var (,) = g();
  }
  function g() public pure returns (uint, uint) {
  }
}
```

There's even some test cases remaining with similar patterns using ``var`` that never had warnings (that's how I just noticed :)), e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7101a8905656d52cf9023a2e4340219d184920c3/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/nameAndTypeResolution/246_multi_variable_declaration_wildcards_fail_5.sol#L3

@ekpyron this problem did exist also before the var-keyword removal btw. The question is, what kind of failure message do we want to generate on unnamed empty LHS tuples (?).

Yes - they already slipped through the deprecation of ``var`` and didn't have warnings (otherwise you probably would have noticed in the var-keyword removal).

As for a failure message: in #4431 I use ``Variable declaration statement does not declare any variables.`` for the whole declaration statement - but I think we should already catch them earlier and generate an error about ``var`` instead. I think it makes sense to generate a parser error for these already (like ``The "var" keyword was removed and the variable declaration does not declare any variables`` - maybe you find something better and more concise :)). They are unlikely to be actually used anyways.

Or no - probably the best way to deal with them would be two parser errors. One stating that ``var`` is removed and then we could expect an identifier at the closing parenthesis (compare with what ``(,) = (1,2);`` and ``() = (1,2)`` do). Do you think that makes sense?

Since it makes no sense to use these constructs anyways, at least I think we don't need to preserve them beyond the parser like with "actual" var declarations :).
