Follow-up from https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3876 :

If possible, ABI-decoding should be done in a lazy way, especially in functions marked `external`: Function arguments should be immutable (even value types) and should only be decoded when requested. This is especially useful for deeply nested array and struct data.

Similarly, `abi.decode` could return a special virtual data type where decoding is only done when the data is converted to a mutable or memory data type.
