This is a proposal to add explicit gaps in the storage layout of a contract (or perhaps even a struct) to help with upgradable contracts.

The problem is that whenever you want to add new storage members during an upgrade, you can only add them at the very end of the member list. It is even worse if you have two struct variables next to each other, because it basically disallows any modification to the structs.

Since the address space of storage is gigantic, it does not hurt to add a gap of e.g. 2**200 slots every now and then (apart from the increased code size of the offsets).

The syntax could be something like `storageGap(<size>)`, but it should probably be a bit more explicit.

This came out of a discussion with @gnidan.
