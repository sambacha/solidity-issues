Can i use tuples as a type with arrays? Like this:
```Solidity
(uint, uint)[] ts = [(uint(1), uint(2)), (3, 4) ...];
```

Tuples are not first-class citizens in Solidity. For now, they can only be used in expressions and for destructuring assignment, but they are not fully-fledged types.

We should clarify this in the documentation.

May have any way to stores data like this and consume gas as less as possible? For instance structures array, whether will consume gas too much?

I'm not sure I understand your question, but indeed, structs are very similar to tuples.
