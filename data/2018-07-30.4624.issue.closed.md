We should probably not say it explicitly like that but explain that values are assigned subsequent integers starting from zero.


Original issue:
----
Solidity documentation does not guarantee that the underlying integer values are 0,1,2,3... for enum types. See: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/types.html#enums

Please either guarantee these values, or if they are already guaranteed, then note it in the documentation.

I  agree that it would be nice clarifying this. Since values of `enum`s cannot be defined in the syntax, it seems logical that we make commitment (and document that) to how the values are assigned.

Later we could considering overriding the values as a syntactical feature, if desired.
