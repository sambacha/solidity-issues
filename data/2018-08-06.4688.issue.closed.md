From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/3918#issuecomment-382069303 :
```
We tried using solc --standard-json and parsing the linkReferences, but ran into issues since that particular mode of solc does not resolve local (same directory) imports, e.g. import "./Test.sol";. Is that a known issue?
```

@chriseth: I am trying to get into this subject, but I'd appreciate a specific example that breaks. Currently I seem only get "linkerReferences" without any members in the standard JSON.

I'm not quite sure myself, the following works and does output ``linkReferences``:

```
{
  "language": "Solidity",
  "sources":
  {
    "B.sol":
    {
      "content": "import \"./A.sol\"; contract B { uint[10] m; function g() public returns(uint) { return A.f(m); } }"
    },
    "A.sol":
    {
      "urls": [ "./A.sol" ]
    }
  },
  "settings":
  {
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "*": [ "evm.bytecode.linkReferences" ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With contents of ``A.sol`` in current working directory:
```
library A {
	function f(uint[10] storage m) public returns(uint) {
		m[0]++;
		return m[0];
	}
}
```

And compiled with ``solc --allow-paths . --standard-json``.

Should ``import "./A.sol";`` be resolved, even if it is not specified in the json via an url? I'm not sure that's desirable...

I think the idea was to align `solc` with and without standard-json. It should be easier to call the compiler with standard-json, so that it loads files on its own, if possible (you do not have to determine which files are exactly required, if the compiler also does it).

Isn't the allowed directories mechanism safe enough?

I wonder if and how changes here would affect the ``soljson.js``/emscripten interface and whether that needs to be considered here.

StandardCompiler has a member `m_readFile`, which is a js callback in the js version (has to be synchronous, that's why it cannot actually read from the filesystem in nodejs) and a C++ lambda function in the `solc` version.

Ok, actually the function that is passed to `CompilerStack` is the one that is used in the end, but the member of StandardCompiler is a copy of it.

So from my source-code only analysis, the same mechanism is in place regardless of whether standard-json is used or not via `solc`, but for standard-json it does not seem to work.

Because everything is asynchronous in NodeJS, so maybe also the disk I/O functions. AFAIR.

If files are used as urls in the standard json input format, their directories need to be allowed in the command line, via `--allow-paths <path>`.
