_This issue is being reported as part of the current audit being held by Zeppelin Solutions to Solidity's compiler (tag v0.4.24)._

## Description
Compiler crashes when a rational type over 78 digits is present as an array index.

## Error in file
Integer constant too large.
`libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp(1144)`

## Displayed message
`Throw in function virtual dev::u256 dev::solidity::RationalNumberType::literalValue(const dev::solidity::Literal*) const`

## Example code

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract CrashContract {
    function f() returns (string) {
        return (["zeppelin"][123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678]);
    }
}

```

No longer a problem in develop (0.5.0):
```
4716.sol:3:30: Error: Expected primary expression.
        return (["zeppelin"][0000000001000000000200000000030000000004000000000500000000060000000007000000000]);

Hm, also with 0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.Emscripten.clang in Remix I get the same result.

Let me check again. Something must've happened when I minimized the test code.

Updated with working example. I was missing digits it seems.

Yes, the updated example still produces the same problem on develop.

The two functions `RationalNumberType::literalValue` and `RationalNumberType::integerType()` should work in tandem - `intergerType()` (called from `mobileType()`) is called first, and if it returns a null pointer, `literalValue()` should not be called, but somehow it is.

You could start by checking how `literalValue()` is called even though `mobileType()` returned a null pointer when called on the same object before (please also check if that is the case).

I guess problem come from this line https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L2213
`expectType`  function report error `Error: Type int_const 1234...(70 digits omitted)...5678 is not implicitly convertible to expected type uint256.` but till call `numberType->literalValue(nullptr)` make it crash.
May i change `m_errorReporter.typeError` to `m_errorReporter.fatalTypeError` in `expectType` to return error instead of assertion fail?

May i change m_errorReporter.typeError to m_errorReporter.fatalTypeError in expectType to return error instead of assertion fail?

Or should i change `expectType` to return boolean and check it at line https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L2214?
