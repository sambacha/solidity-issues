Came up in #4589.
We seem to use deprecated/obsolete boost features for the test initialization and we may be able to define a custom ``main`` both for shared and static builds.

A custom ``main`` in static boost seems to require a custom built boost: https://live.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/static_lib_customizations/entry_point.html
So it's probably not a good idea.

@ekpyron does this change if we stick to new boost?

@leonardoalt I haven't really looked into it any further, so I'm not sure - someone has to look into the current best practices for boost test initialization both for shared and for static linking and in how far boost is backwards compatible here. Sticking to newer boost will make it easier in any case I guess. But so far our setup, although deprecated, still seems to work.

@ekpyron is this still relevant?

I'm pretty sure this is still relevant.

Ok, this was the issue but wasn't able to find it as it had no reference to `init_unit_test_suite`.

Copying this from #10574:
> It seems to be obsolete: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/adv_scenarios/obsolete_init_func.html

>And (global) fixtures is one suggested option: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/tests_organization/fixtures/global.html
