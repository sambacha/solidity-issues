For a source line of
```
    function newAnnouncement(announcementType Type, string Announcement, string Link, bool Oppositable, string _str, uint256 _uint, address _addr) onlyOwner external {
```
the source reference in the error is truncated to
```
publisher.sol:119:105: Error: Data location must be "calldata" for parameter in external function, but none was given.
 ... string _str ... 
     ^---------^
```

It should show way more context.

The relevant file is `SourceReferenceFormatter.cpp`

An easy to understand and straightforward task to work on. I'll need to increase the length of the error message to accommodate more context about the error. Will submit before the end of the day.

@chriseth, am working on this task. I currently have solc installed and had to build from source (because of the task), I have an issue, remix-ide is using solc to serve. How do I switch to the build and not remove the solc?

Thanks for your help, @iamonuwa ! I'm sorry, I don't understand - how is remix related here? You can trigger the bug in the following way:

Contents of test.sol:
```
contract C {
   function newAnnouncement(announcementType Type, string Announcement, string Link, bool Oppositable, string _str, uint256 _uint, address _addr) onlyOwner external {
}
}
```
Command to run:
```
solc test.sol
```
Output:
```
/tmp/x.sol:2:29: Error: Identifier not found or not unique.
 ... announcementType ... 
     ^--------------^
```
Expected output:
```
/tmp/x.sol:2:29: Error: Identifier not found or not unique.
 ... function newAnnouncement(announcementType, string Announcement, stri ... 
                              ^--------------^
```
