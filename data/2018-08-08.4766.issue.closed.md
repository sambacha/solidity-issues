# [\#4766 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4766) `closed`: Replace the "safety STOP" with an invalid instruction

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2018-08-08 14:13](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4766):

The assembler inserts a `STOP` instruction if there are subassemblies or auxiliary data after the instruction stream:
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/Assembly.cpp#L621

It would probably be better to insert `INVALID` (0xfe) so that testing of the contract would discover miscompilation where the `STOP` previously acted as a way to counteract that (e.g. the compiler should have generated a `0 0 RETURN` or `STOP` there)
