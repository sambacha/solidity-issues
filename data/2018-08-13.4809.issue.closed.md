**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

I think we should add an entry to the FAQ regarding the 0.5.0 change in disallowing casts between uintXX and bytesYY types (we should probably extend the documentation at the end of types.rst and link to it from the FAQ). The question has come up a lot already and is likely to affect a lot of users.

Below some random notes:

It's probably best not just to talk about padding, but to give explicit examples, like:

``uint16(uint8(0x12)) == uint16(0x00123)``,
``uint8(uint16(0x1234)) == uint8(0x34)``,
``bytes2(bytes1(0x12)) == bytes2(0x1200)``,
``bytes1(bytes2(0x1234)) == bytes1(0x12)``

So the padding/truncation convention for integers is the opposite to the convention for bytes. That's why
casts between integers and bytes types of different size would be ambiguous and are therefore disallowed.
Casts between integers and bytes of the same size behave as expected:
``uint16(bytes2(0x1234)) == uint16(0x1234)``,
``bytes2(uint16(0x1234)) == bytes2(0x1234)``

Padding bytes "to the right" is consistent with index access, i.e. ``bytes4(x)[2] == bytes32(x)[2]``.
Padding integers "to the left" is consistent with comparisions, i.e. ``uint16(0x12) == uint8(0x12)``.

The documentation should also explain the literals to bytes conversions of #4091.
