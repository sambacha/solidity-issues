## Prerequisites

why I cannot transfer token in another contract.

## Description

This is my contract.

```

pragma solidity ^0.4.24;
contract ERC20 {
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint);
    function balanceOf(address tokenOwner) public constant returns (uint balance);
    function allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender) public constant returns (uint remaining);
    function transfer(address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function approve(address spender, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success);

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint tokens);
    event Approval(address indexed tokenOwner, address indexed spender, uint tokens);
}

contract TestContract{
    ERC20 public token = ERC20(0xAeeD5A0C200efA0670330d0C7509C854c52AF859);

    function suppy() public view returns (uint){
        return token.totalSupply();
    }

    function sendCoin(uint coints) public{
        token.transfer(msg.sender, coints);
    }

}

```

the function suppy() is OK.
but  sendCoin(uint coints)  isn't OK. 

and remix show error :

Gas estimation failed
Gas estimation errored with the following message (see below). The transaction execution will likely fail. Do you want to force sending? 
Invalid JSON RPC response: ""

Sorry, but this does not look like a problem with the Solidity compiler. Could you please report this either with remix or the backend client you are using? Thanks!
