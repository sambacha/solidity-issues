# [\#4834 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4834) `closed`: Post-constantinople, we should use extcodehash instead of extcodesize
**Labels**: `feature`

Once constantinople is finalized, we should use extcodehash instead of extcodesize to check if the called account exists, because it is cheaper.

@chriseth , is it as simple as replacing `extcodesize` with `extcodehash`. Please help to produce some details so that I can work on it

Yes, it is very simple, but I think we should wait until constantinople is finalized.

In theory it can be implemented under the `constantinople` switch, but I'd feel safer committing to this around early October because then the EIPs included in constantinople should be final.

Bump!

This may reduce all calls to external contracts by ~300 GAS, because currently after each call the address is checked using extcodesize, which uses 700 GAS, and extcodehash uses only 400 GAS.

It should also be checked that the result of extcodehash is not `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470` (account with no code).

@Agusx1211 thanks for bringing this up again! Note that the constant `c5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470` has a deploy-time cost of more than 8576 gas, so this only amortizes after 20 calls. This should be checked against the `runs` optimizer parameter.

If we want to avoid providing the constant literally, we could use `keccak256(0, 0)`, which is an extra 39 gas and 4-5 bytes of code (which costs 1000 gas to deploy).

This was an obvious pricing mistake and it is rectified by EIP-1884 in the upcoming Istanbul update.

Oh wow, I thought `extcodehash` is cheaper because the size is not directly stored in the trie. So in the end, both opcodes have the same cost?

Good point though that size is not stored, size should cost more :)

But the issue was balance and codehash should cost equal because both are stored in the account.

So does that mean we can now close this?

Unless `extcodesize` is repriced, it seems that added cost of checking for empty hash makes this change not very useful. I'd opt for closing now.

Does solidity provide a global for determining if a contract exists or is this assembly technique still best approach?
```solidity
uint256 codeSize;
assembly { codeSize := extcodesize(0x123...) }
bool exists = codeSize > 0;
```

It is the best approach.
