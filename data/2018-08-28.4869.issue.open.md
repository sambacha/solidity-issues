# [\#4869 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4869) `open`: Private state variable + external getter with same name should be possible
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

It's currently not possible to do this:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract Foo {
    uint private value;

    function value() external returns (uint) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

It fails with `DeclarationError: Identifier already declared` referring to the function `value()` and the variable `value`. This is a spurious error, though, because the function is `external` and thus it makes no sense for its name to be in scope. In fact, trying to refer to an `external` function internally raises an `Undeclared identifier` error. 

It should be possible to do this, just as it's possible to have `internal` variable + `external` getter through the use of the `public` state variable visibility.

I would propose to fix that in 0.5.1 (since it is not a new behaviour) and in general add it to the inheritance discussion project.

Added it to the design backlog, but I'm not too confident that this is in line with the explicitness and clarity goals.
