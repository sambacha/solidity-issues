# [\#4891 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4891) `closed`: CompilerUtils::storeInMemoryDynamic and ::prepareMemoryStore should have assert about value type
**Labels**: `good first issue`, `bounty worthy :moneybag:`, `difficulty: medium`

The two functions have too lax assertions. We should try to add an assert that the type is a value type and otherwise "sane" - perhaps we should even restrict the possible types explicitly.

For external contributors: Try to add assertions about `_type.category()` one after the other and see which ones break any tests.

The same can be done about `ExpressionCompiler::appendCompareOperatorCode` and other functions in the area.

@vs77bb , can you please see to it that my gitcoin-profile and all related data is deleted? I do not wish that any data related to my person is hosted on gitcoin.co.

@chriseth , I'll see to it to fix some things on your project, it looks that you need more people-power. I'll do this independent of gitcoin, which is far too "centralized" and "intrusive" for my taste.

I believe that two things are missing here (note that I process this issue here abstractly, without much domain knowledge, which should be even of benefit) : 

## Missing Code Documentation 

`CompilerUtils::storeInMemoryDynamic` has zero documentation, e.g. the basics about what this function does, and what types are supported)

## Missing Code Tests:

Searching through the source-code indicates that `storeInMemoryDynamic` is not used directly within any(!) tests.

## Further Processing

So, the question is:

shouldn't those things (basic docs, basic tests) be done first (by core devs), before external devs are asked to further extent this? 

You can alternatively just comment here like 

> CompilerUtils::StorInMemoryDynamic stores the passe _type into .... {...} types are restricted to xyz. _padToWordBoundaries does what its name imply: ensure that date is aligned to WordBoundaries

## Possible Implementation

The `isValueType` assertion works immediately:

```cpp
void CompilerUtils::storeInMemoryDynamic(Type const& _type, bool _padToWordBoundaries)
{
	solAssert(_type.isValueType(), "Only value types can be stored");
```

Further assertions could be applied whilst using the other `Type::is` methods, or by introducing a new method like `Type::isMemoryStorable`.

```cpp
void CompilerUtils::storeInMemoryDynamic(Type const& _type, bool _padToWordBoundaries)
{
	solAssert(_type.isValueType(), "Only value types can be stored");
        solAssert(_type.isMemoryStorable(), "Given Type is not Memory Storable"); 
```

## Finally

Like always, I possibly simply missed a point.

Note that this function is in the deprecation phase.

The documentation is in the header:
```
	/// Dynamic version of @see storeInMemory, expects the memory offset below the value on the stack
	/// and also updates that. For reference types, only copies the data pointer. Fails for
	/// non-memory-references.
	/// @param _padToWords if true, adds zeros to pad to multiple of 32 bytes. Array elements
	/// are always padded (except for byte arrays), regardless of this parameter.
	/// Stack pre: memory_offset value...
	/// Stack post: (memory_offset+length)
```

@chriseth , thanks for the offer!

Problem: I usually can use chat only for small-talk (e.g. not for analytical conversation, me loosing it fast). So I'm bound to asynchronous, topic based media (issue-tracker, email etc.).

I have just two or three questions:

* The documentation in the header-files is used to produce docs? Where can I find info on this?
* where can i find more info about the deprecation? 


(And please: don't tell anyone that I oversaw the docs in the header-files. I guess I was for far too long within JS and java code)

Haha that's fair :)

We do not generate standalone code documentation. I usually much prefer seeing documentation and code in the same place because they often complement each other and it is easy to jump to definitions using a proper IDE. Standalone documentation is only useful if the documentation is a full specification, which only makes sense for standardized libraries in my opinion.

The function is in deprecation because all of the code generator is in deprecation - this is not specifically documented anywhere, though, except via our regular planning meetings.

I totally prefer in-code documentation, too.

I think I've enough info now, so in a few days I should have the result.
