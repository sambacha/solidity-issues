Hey @fkysly @zhuangjinxin @hongbinzuo @PhyrexTsai @mrblocktw @GoodVincentTu

Just checking in to see how things are going with the Chinese translation? Would be great if you could tell me the fork so we can add it to the list of translations. Any other questions or problems, let me know.

We are currently working on a new, hopefully more structured workflow for the Solidity docs translations. I will ping you once this is ready. Closing this issue for now, you can track the progress of the new process etc. in issue #10119.
