# [\#4990 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4990) `open`: Feature to apply modifier to all functions
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

Certain use-cases require a check to be applied to all or at least many functions. Most notably, this includes a general smart contract deactivation function (as replacement for dangerous selfdestruct), a "pausable" pattern and so on.

Modifiers already provide basic support, but it is too easy to forget a modifier to be mentioned with a single function, also it requires quite some typing and can get cluttered fast.

Modifier areas ( #623 ) are a similar solution, but they do not work with inheritance.

This proposal tries to start a discussion about how modifier areas could work better with inheritance. The drawback of this proposal is that it provides less choice about which functions to apply.

Syntax proposal:
```
using modifier <modifier> for *;
```

This applies the given modifier to all functions in this contract, including inherited functions and all functions in potential derived contracts.

It might make sense to restrict this to functions that are non-view functions.

Potential syntax: `using modifier <modifier> for payable, non-payable;`

I'm writing a contract that could benefit from this. I was calling the idea "default modifier" before I found this thread via your thread on modifier areas.

I no longer need "default modifier" because changed approach. So will likely not have meaningful input to this issue, since not in self-interest for dApp I work on.
