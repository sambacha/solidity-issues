Also didn't quite understood this code `function () internal returns (uint) x;`. What we are trying to accomplish here.

@anurag-git this is a declaration of a variable that has a function type. `C.x` should work in the same way for state variables of all types. Please don't try to solve this bug unless you fully understands its implications, it might be quite tricky.
