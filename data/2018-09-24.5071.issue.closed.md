# [\#5071 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5071) `closed`: Yul: Implement "expression breaker' and simplify full function inliner

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-09-24 12:32](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5071):

The optimizer should have a stage that breaks every single expresison which is at the statement level into sub-expressions which each go into their own variable declaration. This is currently partly done in the full inliner, but the full inliner would be much easier to implement if this were done for all expressions (which are not part of conditions), everywhere.

The expression breaker step can be undone by the rematerializer. The rematerializer could be improved to automatically remove a variable if it is only used once (this currently needs the `unused pruner`).

The rematerializer currently also cannot undo the expression breaker if the opcodes are not movable. This restriction could be lifted if the expression breaker is undone in the correct order.

Because of that, it might be helpful to create another stage just for undoing the expression breaker.

TODO: Find a better name.
