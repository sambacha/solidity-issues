```
k.sol:1:1: Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.5.0-develop.2018.9.24+commit.c9290462.mod.Darwin.appleclang - note that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
pragma solidity ^0;
^-----------------^
```

I think `^0` should work for any `0.y.z` version, but I may be mistaken.

If someone takes this, please check if it should work or not.

According to the [docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.25/layout-of-source-files.html#version-pragma) that should not work since will allow only the right most number to be anything to avoid breaking changes. However, this is not the behaivour specified in [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004), and the docs clearly state that "It is possible to specify much more complex rules for the compiler version, the expression follows those used by npm." 

If I am not mistaken theres is a contradiction in the documentation.

I do believe there is an issue if npm rules are accepted. According to npm docs "A missing minor and patch values will desugar to zero, but also allow flexibility within those values, even if the major version is zero." so 
`pragma solidity ^0.4.0;` and `pragma solidity ^0.4;` should be equivalent, however the latter does not work in Version: 0.4.26-develop.2018.9.27.  The version of solc installed by brew  (Version: 0.4.8) both samples compile so maybe is an intended change.

That is exactly how I understand it too @mestorlx. @chriseth if you agree, I'd take this one over.

Can I take this one if no one is working on it?

@HenryRLee Sure. This one is up for grabs. Please assign yourself then.

Thanks, @erak. I'll start working on it. But I don't think I have the privilege to self-assign.
