We do have `soltest.sh` that does the trick, of course that needs a shell or even bash.

The problem with doing the same for a binary is that I don't know if there is a way for the binary to discover its own path.

I don't think we should make assumptions about the CWD.

In my opinion, keeping the C++ binary as simple as possible to stay portable and move all the porcelain to shell scripts (which might then be platform-dependent) is the right way forward. The binary should behave fully predictable because it is much harder to take a look at its source.

@lazaridiscom due to popular demand, the feature now exists :)
