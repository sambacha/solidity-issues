I would like to compile smart contracts from etherscan.io that specify a specific version of solc. 
Is there an archive of older official release binaries of solc somewhere?

@pieterhartel Did you manage to compile your contracts? If so, I'd consider this resolved.

Thanks for asking. The binaries for v0.4.16 .. v0.4.25 work fine. The other binaries all complain about a missing library:

```
$ bin/v0.4.1/solc  --version
bin/v0.4.1/solc: error while loading shared libraries: libboost_filesystem.so.1.54.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

I don't know how to get that version of lib boost...

This is the list of archived binaries: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/list.json (the actual binaries are in the same directory)

Due to portability, we only really support the emscripten binaries as archived binaries.

Thanks, I have managed to install all old  emscripten versions of the compiler on my linux system. The v0.4.x compilers seem to be reliable, but I some of the pre v0.4.0 versions are not that reliable.

I'll close the issue.

@pieterhartel How did you install the older versions? I need to install v0.4.x on my linux system for benchmarking purpose. 
Thanks in advance.

@namrata690 If you're fine with 0.4.10 onward, download them from here: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/linux-amd64

If you want earlier versions, get the soljson binaries from https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/bin
To use them you'll need `solc-js` as a wrapper. See https://github.com/ethereum/solc-js#using-a-legacy-version

Thanks @cameel.
