From the zeppelin audit:

Strings in Solidity are not only used for displaying information: for example, it is very common to have them be a key of a mapping. Because UTF-8 allows for multiple invisible characters (e.g. ZERO WIDTH SPACE), and for characters that look almost like common characters (e.g. GREEK QUESTION MARK), this usage can be extremely problematic, and lead to underhanded backdoors, exploits, etc. OpenZeppelin’s main access-control contracts are affected by this, as are multiple other string-based implementations.
Consider adding a non-UTF-8 string type to prevent these situations from arising in the first place.

An obvious way to introduce them is via a prefix (like in `hex"0101"`) - the main question would be whether the non-prefixed string should allow utf8 or only ascii.

If we do not want a breaking change: `ascii"abcd"`

If we are happy to do a breaking change, then the current strings would need to be prefixed with `unicode` or `utf8`: `unicode"this is a string..."`.

Note that things like `"\u1234"` should still be allowed in the "non-utf8-strings".

Why?

Because the idea is that the source representation does not have any "weird" characters, but the internal representation can be anything.

@maraoz would you agree?

Preliminary vote: make ascii strings the default and require a prefix for unicode strings

Decision on meeting:
- Change string literal to not allow anything but ASCII printable characters **and** escape codes.
- Introduce `unicode` prefix for string literals, which also allows Unicode characters.

Does an ascii string allow unicode escape?

```
string a = "\u1234"; // is this valid?
string b = unicode"\u1234"; // is this valid?
```

Yes, we said unicode escapes in default strings are fine, but not unicode characters.

While implementing I had realised a few things: it is quite a large change allowing escapes in non-unicode literals, because the scanner just turns the escape into codepoints.

First thought implementation should have no effect on the design, but this I think is a useful consideration:
1. Hex string literals can contain any kind of data (ascii, unicode, etc.)
2. Regular string literals (i.e. `"hello world"`) should only contain ASCII characters, and cannot contain unicode escapes (disabling the escape in the scanner)
3. Unicode string literals (i.e. `unicode"⚠️"` or `unicode"\u00a0"`)  can contain ASCII, Unicode or Unicode escapes

Assigning any literal to a string type should check for UTF-8 encoding (this is something we have now).

The rules described in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5167#issuecomment-574693822 were implemented.
