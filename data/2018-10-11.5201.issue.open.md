# [\#5201 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5201) `open`: Investigate staticcall/delegatecall trampoline
**Labels**: `enhancement`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-10-11 09:31](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5201):

View library functions are currently called using delegatecall, because there is no delegatecall+staticcall combination. It could be possible to call the current contract using staticcall with a special signature which then forwards to the actual library using deleatecall.

Things to investigate:

 - how much more gas will it cost?
 - which identifier can be used such that there will be no clash with existing function identifiers?
