# [\#5238 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5238) `open`: [Yul] Improve CSE to take commutative operations into account
**Labels**: `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2018-10-16 13:39](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5238):

Currently, the CSE cannot detect that `x` and `y` are identical in the following code:
```
functionf(a, b) { let x := or(a, b); let y := or(b, a); }
```

In the old optimizer, for each expression, the simplifier would be called which would always try the two versions of commutative operations.

Previously, the simplifier would also pull out all constants (there are rules for that) - not sure if this is the case for the new simplifier - at least it also knows about the rules.
