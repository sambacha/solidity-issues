# [\#5349 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5349) `closed`: The solidity source file can not be compiled.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31264787?v=4" width="50">[AhnSungHyeon](https://github.com/AhnSungHyeon) opened issue at [2018-11-06 04:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5349):

The solidity source file can not be compiled.

Install Solidity on Linux Ubuntu 16.04 and write the sample source code for https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.21/solidity-by-example.html

I am trying to compile and save the following warning

Warning: Source file does not specify required compiler version! Consider adding "pragma solidity ^ 0.4.25;"

For reference, the solidity version I installed was 0.4.25, so I changed the pragma solidity ^ 0.4.25 at the top of the sample source code.

Could you tell me why this is happening?


For the first time, I installed it as apt when I installed it for the first time. I installed it with the latest version 0.5.0 and tried to compile it.

Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
Error: Source file requires different compiler version (current compiler is 0.5.0-develop.2018.10.30 + commit.0b4f6ab7.Linux.g ++ -e that nightly builds are considered to be strictly less than the released version
