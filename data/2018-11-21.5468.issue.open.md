Different error kinds and exceptions are formatted differently and with different level of detail in the CLI vs in the StandardCompiler.

CLI: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/solc/CommandLineInterface.cpp#L1503
StandardCompiler: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L942

The goal here is to make the CLI output similarly detailed as the StandardCmpiler.

This could be superseded by #9583.
