but when i execute _transferCoin()_ function, error consoled:

I was really confused that I executed _addFund()_ to add amount to the current _msg.sender_, but why can not transfer to another account?

By the way, 
1. what is **msg.value** and how to use it?
2. when transfer ether from account to another account (_not from a contract to another contract_), **msg.sender.transfer(uint)** or **addrss(this).transfer(uint)** or **anothre_account_address.transfer(uint)**? which one?

Thanks
