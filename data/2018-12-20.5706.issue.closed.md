`datasize` and `dataoffset` need immediate literal strings that cannot be replaced by variables. The optimizer has to respect that.

The two places where this splitting might happen are the CommonSubexpressionEliminator and the ExpressionSplitter. They might just have a blacklist of functions they cannot enter.
