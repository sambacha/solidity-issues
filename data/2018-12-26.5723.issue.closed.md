## Description
I am trying to compare the token contract address with the address(0). This was working fine in older version of truffle and solidity compiler (0.4.24). When I upgraded truffle and started using the latest truffle and compiler version (0.5.0) I am unable to compare the token contract address and address(0).

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.0
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):0.5.0
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):Truffle
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Issue in compiling
- Operating system:Windows

## Steps to Reproduce

npm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity#release-v2.1.0-solc-0.5
