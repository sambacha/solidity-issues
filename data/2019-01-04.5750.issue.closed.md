# [\#5750 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5750) `closed`: Unstable compiler error “Unknown exception during compilation” appear
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

The online compiler gives unstable error message between the same codes and similar scenario.

Remix keeps throwing "Unknown exception during compilation." when the function is doing multiple dynamic returns( three uint[] dynamic array).

But when I size the returning to TWO dynamic arrays, the issue disappeared. And now I have no any clue about the reason behind it. Have switch different pragma solidity version already.

Minimal version:
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;


contract C  {
function Determine_Result(uint GameId, uint RoundId) internal returns (uint[] memory WinnerUserId, uint[] memory DrawUserId, uint[] memory LoserUserId) {

    uint[] memory Im_WinnerUserIdSet;
}}
```
I was not yet able to reproduce this on the commandline, but I can reliably reproduce it on remix. Might be related to standard-json.

Transferring this issue to the solidity repository.

It seems this has been fixed with the nightly release of 2019-01-08.
