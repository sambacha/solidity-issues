# [\#5802 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5802) `closed`: Converting a solidity AST back to solidity Source Code

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41312286?u=c13312de1d207d5a52b3591fc754a5e384de7438&v=4" width="50">[tharindu1992](https://github.com/tharindu1992) opened issue at [2019-01-17 07:41](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5802):

Is there a way to convert AST back to Solidity Source code. 

The use case is to mutate the AST and recreate the Solidity Source code for optimization and testing purposes.

Currently, there is no way. There is initial work on re-importing an AST, though, which could be of interest: #2096

Duplicate of #2165?

I think both issues need to be further clarified :)

Clarified it a bit there, not sure how much more it can be clarified :)

Closing this here.

Has there been any updates on this? I need to make use of this feature.

No, the compiler can parse an AST from JSON but currently does not offer a feature to synthesize code back from that. There are external tools that can do that though. Check out [solc-typed-ast](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solc-typed-ast).

BTW, this issue has been closed because it's a duplicate. The feature request is now tracked in #2165. I'm locking this thread - please post any related comments there.
