# [\#5823 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5823) `closed`: Verify that there are no more obsolete boost workarounds in the code.
**Labels**: `enhancement`

We have a reimplementation of ``weakly_canonical`` in ``libdevcoce/CommonIO`` for backwards compatibility with boost < 1.60 - but since we now require boost >= 1.65 anyways, we can remove that and use the (superious) boost version directly.

There are at least two more workarounds:
- https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.h#L60
- `boost_multiprecision_number_compare_bug_workaround.hpp` in libdevcore

Extended scope to all boost workarounds.

There will probably be some overlap with the C++17 PR that is definitely to be expected soon :-) - e.g. with C++17 we even have ``std::filesystem::weakly_canonical`` and should prefer that.

I'd prefer to get the boost simplifications merged first.

I'll keep this open for now, since I think there are more workarounds - if anybody double-checks, we can close it, otherwise I'll look into it next month.
EDIT: unassigning the issue since I changed its scope.

Just saw one boost < 1.59 workaround left in ``test/boostTest.cpp``.

Hmm... This could be related to the ossfuzz build CI failure in #7010

Here's one more workaround for <1.55: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L55

And a boost test workaround for <1.59: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/boostTest.cpp#L52

And three more workaround in the `RuleList`:

1) Fixed in 1.64 (we require >=1.65):
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/RuleList.h#L50-L55

2) I'm not sure what version these appeared in or what bug they have produced
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libevmasm/RuleList.h#L40-L48

The only workarounds seem to be in `RuleList.h` for multiprecision div/mod/shl.

@ekpyron still want to track it here? Can those be removed?

Maybe we better not remove those - it'd be quite bad if there is any situation in which they'd be needed and we removed them. If those are the only ones I'd say we can close this.

Agree, that's why I didn't touch them last time :wink:

I think those are the only ones left. Will remove them with #3851.
