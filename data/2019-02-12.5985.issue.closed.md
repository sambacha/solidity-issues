## Description

The [solc snap is failing to build](https://launchpadlibrarian.net/411054626/buildlog_snap_ubuntu_bionic_arm64_solidity_BUILDING.txt.gz) because it now requires z3 4.6.0 or higher.

This version is not in the ubuntu archive, so we will have to build it from source. PR coming...

Note that you can also use cvc4, this is what we do for the PPA ubuntu release!
