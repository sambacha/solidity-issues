The solidity grammar is extremely well hidden away in
``Solidity In Depth -> Miscellaneous -> Cheatsheet -> Language Grammar``.
I would say it deserves a top-level entry in ``Solidity In Depth`` or *at the very least* in ``Solidity In Depth > Miscellaneous``.

Fixed by #8505. The antlr grammar is exposed now.

It's not! This is about moving it to somewhere where it's visible in the docs!

This is what I see, I would say it is not that hidden.
