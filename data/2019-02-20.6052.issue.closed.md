This raises no complaints, so maybe this is supported?
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract C {
  function f() public view {
    string memory x = "";
    bytes memory y = bytes(x);
    assert(bytes(x).length == 0);
  }
}
```

Perhaps add it into the smt tests and close this issue.

Can you try with values larger than 32 bytes? Or actually with smaller ones as well, but non empty?

No complaint with `string memory x = "not empty"`, nor with `string memory x = "this is longer than 32 this is longer than 32 this is longer than 32 this is longer than 32";`.

But is the assertion about the length still correct?

Oh, you are right, it doesnt picks it up ðŸ˜•

I think that's rather a problem in the assignment to string though. The conversion to bytes should pick it up if the assignment worked in the first place.

Closing because of the last comment.
