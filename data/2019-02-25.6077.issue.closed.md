# [\#6077 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6077) `closed`: mstore at far away addresses slows down the yul interpreter

## Description

The Yul interpreter takes a long time to interpret stores at far-away addresses.

Example
```
{mstore(8888888,4)}
```

Likely cause is the for loop in the second link.

The interpretation of mstore happens here 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/46a9ed12da07e626e2cedbf20a8baa357a073758/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L272-L275

Here, memory contents are printed out starting from address 0 in steps of 32 bytes.

## Solution

We could emulate stores/loads modulo some small prime number. That way, the effective range of the for loop is limited.

I think it should only dump the modified area with `...` prepended/appended if there is available memory before/after.

I agree - there is a TODO in the code that asks for a "vector with holes" to be used for memory.

If you think that the logging is the problem instead of just storing the memory, we could also just get rid of the dump.

I think #6800 should fix this issue

@bshastry was this fixed?

This has been fixed.
