# [\#6086 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6086) `closed`: EVM version: "petersburg"

Constantinople was launched on the testnets, but was cancelled last minute on mainnet. It is to be launched on the same block as "Petersburg", which disables "net gas metering" introduced in Constantinople.

Since we do not support net gas metering in the gas estimator this should have no effect for us.

While it feels strange to have two hard forks, which in practice mean a single one, I still suggest we introduced "petersburg" as an entry in our EVMVersion listed to avoid any further confusion with users.

It is not fully clear if the community will refer to this hardfork as "constantinople" or "petersburg", but technically all documentation and clients are referring to it separately.

The [metadata EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1716) refers to it as "Petersburg" just as geth and truffle do.

Just for the reason Truffle as a popular devtool uses the term "Petersburg" I think we should do as well to avoid confusion.
