# [\#6108 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6108) `closed`: yulInterpreter: calldatacopy triggers a range check assertion inside the yul interpreter
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

Interpreting the following strict assembly code snippets independently fails the same assertion.

Code snippet 1

```
{calldatacopy(444,44444,4)}
```

for own reference:
  target offset = 444
  source offset = 44444
  size = 4

Code snippet 2

```
{extcodecopy(88888,88888,6,8)}
```

Code snippet 3

```
{codecopy(3,1,573)}
```

triggers this assertion

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/1169004cec0fb256a1023ac6e67b692ccdac22d4/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L85

Presumably, this is because `_target.size() <= 448`

`_target.size()` evaluates to the size of Interpreter `memory`, so I'm guessing (for some reason) the available memory was insufficient to interpret this specific calldatacopy.

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop commit
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:

## Steps to Reproduce

Interpret the following code using the yul interpreter.

```
{calldatacopy(444,44444,4)}
```

OR 

```
{extcodecopy(88888,88888,6,8)}
```

OR

```
{codecopy(3,1,573)}
```
