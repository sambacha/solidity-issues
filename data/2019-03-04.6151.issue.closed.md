A struct containing an internal function can be passed across library calls. This is non-sensical, since the library could then call the internal function whose code is not even available.

Example code:

```
library L {
    struct S {
        function() internal x;
    }

    function f(S storage s) public {
        s.x();
    }
}

contract c{
    L.S s;
    function f() public {
        s.x = f;
        L.f(s);
    }
}
```

Suggestion for resolution: Introduce another category of "internalness" for types which cannot even be passed across library calls.

So, just to understand this right, internal functions in libraries can be called from contracts, but internal functions from contracts are not available to the library? (I was [reading](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/contracts.html#libraries))

After verbal clarification: external or public library functions should not accept parameters of type `function() internal`, wrapped in other types or otherwise.

Alternatively, they may accept it, but are not allowed to actually call it.

It is possible to call internal functions of library from contract.

@Alan115-skyhand It is, but this is not the right place to ask support questions. Please try the [#solidity](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity) channel on Gitter or ask on https://ethereum.stackexchange.com.
