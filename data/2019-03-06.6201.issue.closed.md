# [\#6201 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6201) `closed`: Fuzzing Low-level Lisp-like Language parser/compiler
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Description

The following sub directories inside solidity are not touched by the fuzzer atm
  - `liblll`
  - `lllc`

Is it worth while to write a fuzzer for the LLL parser/compiler? Of course, it would be interesting to additionally test code optimization/generation but currently we don't have the same test infrastructure (interpreter) that we have for yul code.

The main problem with lllc is that it was written in a rather peculiar style and thus the code is rather hard to understand. I think nobody currently on the team has proper knowledge of that code and it would take quite some time to fix bugs.

I've fixed couple of issues back in the day, but it would rather need a rewrite to make use of all our new features, APIs and Yul.

A while back we have agreed to phase out LLL from the codebase (pending another compiler be written by for lll -> yul) and because of that I'd suggest to ignore LLL in fuzzing.

As per the discussion, it seems like LLL is not an interesting target for fuzzing since it is going to be phased out. Closing issue.
