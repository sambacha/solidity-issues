**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Description

The main configuration settings for the yulInterpreter that affect fuzzing are (defaults shown in brackets):
  - Max Size of memory used for emulating yul instructions (state memory=512MB)
  - Max number of traces until the interpreter times out (trace size=10000)

This needs a relook.

Also up for discussion is how to bail out from infinite loops in cases where the maxTraceSize won't help us.

Example
```
{for { let i := 1} i {} {}}
```

### Data

We currently set `maxTraceSize=10000` which is too large.

Data suggests the following

For non-crashing test inputs

|   Number of test inputs  |  Avg. trace size | Median trace size |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 18112 | 5.4 | 3 |

For historical crashing test inputs

|   Number of test inputs  |  Avg. trace size | Median trace size |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 22 | 4.1 | 3 |

For historical slow test inputs (inputs that slow down the fuzzing binary)

|   Number of test inputs  |  Avg. trace size | Median trace size |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 80 | 463 | 131.5 |

For historical test inputs that increase memory allocation in the fuzzing binary

|   Number of test inputs  |  Avg. trace size | Median trace size |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| 8 | 226.5 | 226.5 |

As for maxMemorySize, I don't have data yet, but setting it to 512MB (current default) is too large and leads to out-of-memory. Also, I'm not sure if we want to strictly emulate memory loads and stores beyond a small window of say 1 KB. At the moment, programs such as the following can arbitrarily increase size of interpreter state memory.
```
{mstore(12321321, 0)}
```

Take aways:
  - The trace size distribution of non-crashing and crashing test inputs are somewhat similar although the latter has a very small sample size
  - The distribution of slow and out-of-memory test inputs is starkly different
  - Makes sense to reduce the maximum trace size threshold so that we don't spend time on slow/oom inputs
  - Reduce maxMemorySize to say 1 KB

Update: Plotted trace size for inputs in the corpus (about 4000 valid yul programs). Found trace size to lie between 0 and 100. 10000 seems excessive at this point.
