**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Description

We make frequent use of the protobuffers language construct `oneof ... {}` that essentially defines a message to be one of several things.

We translate `oneof`s into yul code by using a waterfall if ... else if pattern, which is inelegant and prone to bugs.

Instead we should be making use of a switch statement with explicit cases.
