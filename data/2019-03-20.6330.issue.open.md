# [\#6330 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6330) `open`: [Yul] Improve error reporting for datasize() & dataoffset() misusage

This is in reference to PR #6322, where we provide better exception diagnostics.

Now, the plan is to properly catch invalid arguments to those assembly functions by catching them earlier, i.e. in the AsmAnalysis.

For that to work, AsmAnalysis needs to know about assembly objects (structure).

Passing an invalid argument should then report to `ErrorReporter` as a `TypeError` (?).

Can you explain what is the problem here? We seem to have a check in `AsmAnalysis` for finding unknown object cases (errorcode 3517).
