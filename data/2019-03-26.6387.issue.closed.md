**Labels**: `feature`

## Abstract

This is a blocker for fuzz testing optimization routines for the newly introduced break/continue statements inside for loop bodies (#6136 and #6315 ).

## Motivation

The problem seems to that the Stack compressor depends on the Code Transformer that does not yet support break/continue statements and signals this by throwing an assertion.
