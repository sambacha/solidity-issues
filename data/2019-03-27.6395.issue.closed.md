# [\#6395 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6395) `closed`: yulInterpreter: Implement a timeout for programs without side-effects to deal with long/infinite loops
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

## Abstract

The yulInterpreter should be able to bail out if it encounters a program like this

```
{
  for (let i := 1} i {}
  {
  } 
}
```

## Motivation

There is a "timeout" at the moment, but it is based on the trace size, which assumes that every program has a side-effect. In addition to a trace-based timeout, it would be nice to have a timeout based on the number of interpreted steps. 

Each operation on the interpreter counts for one step, and we expose a parameter called something like `maxSteps` that defaults to say `10000.` On the interpreter reaching this limit, it throws an interpreter terminated assertion.

## Specification

I think implementing this should be straightforward. The main thing to understand is where to increment the "step counter."
