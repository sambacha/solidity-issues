# [\#6406 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6406) `closed`: Question regarding solc mapping

## Description
There were some instances where solc mapping is mapped to the entire code. Whats the difference between that and the code with file mapping pointed to -1?

The compiler uses internal code at some places - this is where the `-1` is used: When we know the position in the file but do not know the file itself.
