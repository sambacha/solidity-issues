**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

When calling a function from a base contract including the base contract explicit name, Solidity only considers the first overload of the function defined in the contract.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.7
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix

## Steps to Reproduce

The following code fails to compile with error `Wrong argument count for function call: 1 arguments given but expected 2` in the `Base.init(c)` call.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract Base {
    function init(uint256 a, uint256 b) public { }
    function init(uint256 a) public { }
}

contract Child is Base {
    function init(uint256 c) public {
        Base.init(c);
    }
}
```

However, swapping the order of the two `init` functions in `Base` fixes the issue, which seems to indicate that the compiler is only picking up the first declaration of the overloaded function. Calling `Base.init(c,c)` also fixes the issue.
