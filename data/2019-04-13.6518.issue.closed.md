## Abstract

There should be a Dockerfile for `lllc`.

## Motivation

Currently, there is docker image for `solc`, but not `lllc` which is also an executable placed in this repository.

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

A new Dockerfile or add a new build target to current Dockerfile at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/scripts/Dockerfile that is for `lllc`.

Would recommend checking out Yul instead of LLLC as they will not continue to maintain that language going forward.

@SilentCicero Thanks for your comment. However, many current infrastructures(e.g. ethereum/aleth) are still depending on `lllc`. So, I would say it's still worth doing for the time being.

Be warned that lll has always be unspecified and is not very well tested.

Given our current plan is to sunset and remove lllc (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1230#issuecomment-559116361), I'd argue against creating a docker image.
