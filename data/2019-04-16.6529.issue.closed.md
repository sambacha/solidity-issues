**Labels**: `enhancement`, `difficulty: easy`, `testing :hammer:`

We introduced a polling algorithm to fix the random CI bugs described in #5803 
That was required because `eth_flush` was not reliable in the aleth version we used.
Now that we updated to the new aleth, we can simplify or remove that polling code.
