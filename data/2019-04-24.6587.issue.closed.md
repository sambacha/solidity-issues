## Description

The nightly CI is expected to handle three broad class of errors:
  - Memory leaks
  - Out-of-bounds access violations
  - unexpected termination due to exceptions, assertions etc.

It was discovered in the nightly CI logs that support for handling unexpected termination is missing from the regressions python script.

Due to this, unexpected terminations are not treated as errors by the test runner and consequently silently ignored.
