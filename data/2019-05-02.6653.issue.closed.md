# [\#6653 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6653) `closed`: [ossfuzz] refactor build system so that fuzzing test harnesses can be built locally
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

## Abstract

<!--
Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.
-->

At the moment, we rely on the ossfuzz build CI to check if fuzzers build correctly.

Problem: PRs that change fuzzer harness code need to wait until CI run completes to detect compilation issues.

## Motivation

<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

Solution: Change the existing build structure such that harnesses could be built locally, and only the external dependency linkage is left to the ossfuzz build CI.

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->

TBD

I'm not sure how to implement this without having to pre-build the external dependencies
- libFuzzer
- libProtobufMutator

@chriseth would you be open to adding this to the list of external dependencies at the cost of increasing SLoC count and build time? The benefit, of course, is we don't have to wait for the ossfuzz CI to finish to know of compilation issues in fuzzer code.

What about extracting the libfuzzer interface code to some point where at least build failures would be visible?

@chriseth That sounds reasonable to me. One way to do that (in my mind) is that all `*_ossfuzz.cpp` files only contain a call to the test harness function that is defined in some utility source file.

```
int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput()
{
  testHarness();
  return 0;
}
```

and 

```
// should compile without dependencies
FuzzerUtil::testHarness()
{
  ...
}
```

and then we split the ossfuzz build targets into those that depend on external deps and those that don't. Those that don't can then be added to the "default" solidity build. Those that depend on external deps are delegated to the ossfuzz build CI that we currently have.

@chriseth what do you think?

Sounds good!
