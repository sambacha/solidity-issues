<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.
-->

## Description

The differential proto fuzzer is consistently failing in the nightly CI. This means that the nightly CI believes there is a difference in traces of unoptimized and optimized yul code.

The failure is seen for

```
{
mstore(1, exp(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,exp(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,add(1,1))))
}
```

OR

```
{
mstore(exp(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,not(1)), 1)
}
```

OR

```
{
mstore(exp(41,not(1)), 1)
}
```

but is not reproducible with clang-9 or clang-6. The CI uses clang-7.

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

For
```
{mstore(exp(3,not(1)), 1)}
```

```
Unoptimized trace
 MSTORE_AT_SIZE(0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab, 32) [0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001]                                     

Optimized trace
MSTORE_AT_SIZE(0x8e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e38e39, 32) [0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001]

It looks like this function inside the yul interpreter miscomputes the exponentiation

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/35677019a3216938b76acd6f3ab53899814f8790/test/tools/yulInterpreter/EVMInstructionInterpreter.cpp#L39-L51

Here's how the optimizer computes exponentiation

Not much progress on this. Have a feeling this may be a boost bug

Ubuntu distro | Boost version | Bug reproduces? |
------------------| --------------------| --------------------|
Bionic  | 1.65 | No |
Cosmic | 1.67 | Yes |
NA (source build) | 1.69 | No |

Note to self: bug no longer reproduces when downgrading CI env from ubuntu cosmic (18.10 uses 1.67 boost) to ubuntu bionic (18.04 uses 1.65 boost).

- boost::multiprecision::powm seems to be bug free
- bug is potentially in one of the mp ops in the hand-written exponentiation function in the yul interpreter

I think this is the change of behaviour from "undefined but buggy" to "defined" in the conversion to smaller type. I'll try to create a fix PR.
