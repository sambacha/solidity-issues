<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.
-->

## Description

Compiling a contract that changes a state variable address using --optimize will eventually fail during deployment.
<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version:^0.5.8
<!--- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: 
-->
## Steps to Reproduce

Write a simple contract that sets the owner in its constructor.
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.8;
contract Test{
  address private ownerDSO;
  constructor() public{
    ownerDSO = msg.sender; //even ownerDSO = ownerDSO; will fail during deployment
  }
}
```
Compile with the following command.
```
solc Test.sol --bin --overwrite --optimize
```
Try to deploy the contract to the blockchain (it will fail). To deploy it successfully drop the --optimize flag from the command. 

Notice that changing a state variable of type int or uint won't give any error  
```
pragma solidity ^0.5.8;
contract Test{
  int private ownerDSOint;
  constructor(int x) public{
    ownerDSOint = x;
  }
}
```

Which chain are you deploying to? Note that 0.5.8 has a default EVM target of "Petersburg" which includes shift opcodes. Does your EVM have shift opcodes?

Then you either have to activate `Petersburg` or use `--evm-version byzantium` or `--evm-version constantinople` for compilation.
