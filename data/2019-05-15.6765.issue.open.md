# [\#6765 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6765) `open`: [Yul] Re-introduce ``sub`` opcode
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`

During CSE, every `sub` by a constant is replaced by an `add` to get uniform expressions. At the end of the optimization phase, after constant-reintroduction, this should be reversed if the cost of the modified constant is better.

This is superceded by the constant optimiser, isn't it?

No, the constant optimizer only operates on actual numbers. Expressions like `sub(codesize(), 10)` will not be improved by the constant optimizer.
