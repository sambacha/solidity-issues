## Description
The 0.4.26 release does not contain the ```solc-static-linux``` binary. 

Several of my scripts and apps depend on the ```solc-static-linux``` binary to be present on each release. Of course I can code around this, but for consistency it would be nice to have it include with the 0.4.26 release as well.

We tried, but it proved quite hard to generate this artefact at this point in time.

Please reopen if you have further questions or if it really badly hurts you... :)
