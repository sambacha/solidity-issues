# [\#6785 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6785) `closed`: Missing documentation for the purpose of using anonymous events (not the what but the why)

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14879163?v=4" width="50">[guylando](https://github.com/guylando) opened issue at [2019-05-19 18:49](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6785):

The documentation states "This means that it is not possible to filter for specific anonymous events by name" but it is unclear why one would want to create such events which can't be filtered by name. Specifying use-cases (at least one) would make it easier for developers to understand when it is better to use this feature.
Searched google, searched existing github issues, no clarification on this anywhere.
