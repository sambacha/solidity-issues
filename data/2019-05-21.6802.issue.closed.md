## Abstract

abiv2 fuzzer depends on evmone and its dependencies (intx and ethash). This issue tracks support in the ossfuzz build CI environment to statically link against the said libraries.

## Motivation

Add a simple bash script to install
  - `evmone`
  - `intx`
  - `ethash`

Although, hunter builds `intx` and `ethash` at the time of `evmone` build, there is no convenient way to locate its install directory location. Therefore, we build the deps again manually.

The additional build steps should not take longer than a few seconds since `intx` and `ethash` are relatively small libraries.
