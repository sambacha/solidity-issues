## Description
build fails with a bunch of undefined reference to 'boost::filesystem::path::remove_filename() or
CMakeFiles/solc.dir/CommandLineInterface.cpp.o:CommandLineInterface.cpp:function dev::solidity::CommandLineInterface::parseArguments(int, char**): error: undefined reference to 'boost::program_options::options_description::m_default_line_length'
<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
I cloned the repo, ran the dependencies script, made a build dir, cmake .., make and it fails on linking
[ 57%] Linking CXX executable solc
## Environment

- Compiler version: gcc 8.3.0 or clang++-8 (not sure which one cmake choose)

- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):

Any suggestions appreciated.

Hello,

Thanks for your report. It looks like you may not have installed prerequisites required for building solidity from source that are listed here

I am able to build solidity using the following dockerfile:
```
FROM ubuntu:disco

RUN apt update
RUN apt -y install git wget cmake libboost-all-dev g++
RUN git clone https://github.com/ethereum/solidity.git
RUN cd solidity
RUN mkdir solidity/build
RUN cd solidity/build && cmake .. && make solc
```

Can you somehow tell which version of boost you are using?

Sorry, didn't pay attention to "ran the dependencies script" in the original post.

FWIW, the officially supported version of boost (via the libboost-dev-all package) is 1.67.0.1

ok, I probably didn't build and install boost from sources properly. I removed 1.70 re-ran cmake it found the system package version and it built successfully. Thanks for the help!
