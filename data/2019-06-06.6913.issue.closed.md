# [\#6913 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6913) `closed`: Support Boost 1.70.

@salamani reported build problems in the gitter channel (thank you very much for your patience!) that led to the realization that apparently boost 1.70 silently breaks cmake support by starting to install a config mode cmake target configuration that is incompatible with the traditional cmake FindBoost modules.

We need to:
 - Support config-mode-only boost setups that *only* define cmake targets, but *don't* define ``BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and ``BOOST_LIBRARIES``.
 - Continue to support boost find modules that *don't* define cmake targets, but *only* define ``BOOST_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and ``BOOST_LIBRARIES``.
 - Add a warning in the documentation explaining how to work around this problem for older releases, if one tries to build them against boost 1.70+.

I suggest to increase the required version of cmake to ``3.5`` (which is the version in Ubuntu 16.04 xenial, i.e. the last LTS version) - that way we can generally use imported targets instead of the variables (which is the future proof way to go anyways).

Need to take care of ``scripts/travis-emscripten/build_emscripten.sh``, though... - currently it only overrides the old-style variables...
