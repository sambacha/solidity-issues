<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
### Bug
Simple functions that do a single arithmetic operation and assignment, and have no branches in their code can have different gas costs, depending on what functions have been called before.

### Expected behaviour
Functions with no branches in their code, always cost the same amount of gas, independent of previous function executions of the contract.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.5.1
- Target EVM version: Constantinople
- Framework/IDE: Truffle
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Ganache (Constantinople chain)
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug. -->

### Project configuration
Starting from a fresh truffle project, add the following contract `Counter.sol`:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.1;

contract Counter {
    uint public count;

    constructor() public {
        count = 1;
    }

    function divide(uint8 factor) public returns (uint) {
        count /= factor;
        return count;
    }

    function add(uint8 value) public returns (uint) {
        count += value;
        return count;
    }
}
```

Add a second migration:
```javascript
var Counter = artifacts.require("Counter")

module.exports = function(deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(Counter);
};
```
And edit the compilers object in `truffle-config.js` to the following:

```javascript
compilers: {
  solc: {
    settings: {
      evmVersion: "constantinople"
    }
  }
}
```
Configure ganache to use the Constantinople hardfork, and then deploy using `truffle migrate`.

### Reproduction
After deployment in Ganache, the following commands were executed in the truffle console:
```
let instance = await Counter.deployed()
instance.add(10) // gasUsed: 27187
instance.divide(100) // gasUsed: 13625
insatnce.add(10) // gasUsed: 42817
```
Where the two add calls had drastically different gas costs.

I guess it is because when you set a zero value in storage to a non-zero value, you need to pay 20000 gas. But when you set a non-zero value into another non-zero value, you only need to pay 5000 gas.

You can refer to https://github.com/djrtwo/evm-opcode-gas-costs to see the gas cost formulae for 
 the `SSTORE` instruction

Yep, @sifmelcara is right - and that accounts exactly for the difference in gas costs. So I'm closing this - please reopen in case I'm missing something.
