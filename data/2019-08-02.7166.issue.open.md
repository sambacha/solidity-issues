# [\#7166 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7166) `open`: [Abiv2 proto fuzzer] Add constructor to test template
**Labels**: `enhancement`

## Abstract

Presently, the ABIv2 test template does not contain a constructor. This issue tracks support for adding one with the following structure:

```
constructor() {
  // Initialize state variables
}
```

This does not yet test ABI coding with the constructor because the abi proto fuzzer does not yet support ABI encoding itself.


## Motivation

Adding the constructor should be straight forward. We would need to move initializations of state variables to the `constructor` function instead of the `test` function.

What would be the benefit?

@chriseth After thinking about this for a little longer, I don't see any benefit unless the constructor accepts external arguments. If it does, we can test abi coding in the constructor. Actually, my motivation for this was #6754

We should indeed fuzz constructor argument decoding, including passing on arguments to base constructors.
