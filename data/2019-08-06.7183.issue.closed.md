Hi. I've started to translate the documentation in italian. By now i think i'm somewhere between 60% and 70% of the process. It is possible to add it later to Read the Docs? 
More importantly, if someone italian speaking wants to contribute, there is a file called ``docs/progress.txt`` where i track the state of the translation. Moreover, proofreading is needed.

The translation is in my own fork https://github.com/damianoazzolini/solidity 
The last commit of the english version is 4fa7800

@damianoazzolini I am OK with rendering partial translations with Read the Docs, but would you rather wait?

Ok, however is still a work in progress (i havent't done any progress since the pull request) and would be nice if someone helps and checks possible typos

@damianoazzolini Is there a community you/I can post in to try and get some people to review? I can do some, but not sure how many Italian speakers there are in there.

@damianoazzolini you should take a look into the "Ethereum Italia Sviluppo" channel on Telegram. 
Btw, I'd be available to help you in completing the Italian translation. Let me know how we can cooperate in this task.

@V0nMis3s awsome! you can create a pull request in my own fork. The file that tracks the progress is  doc/progress.txt. Just simply add the part you want to translate. And it you find someone else, even better!

Ok great everyone! I'll list this in the main documentation for now, and please let me know when you get  something ready to be fed into Read the Docs.

We are currently working on a new, hopefully more structured workflow for the Solidity docs translations. I will ping you once this is ready. Closing this issue for now, you can track the progress of the new process etc. in issue #10119.
