The following test
```
contract C {
    function e() public {
        revert("Transaction failed. Transaction failed.");
    }
}
// ====
// EVMVersion: >homestead
// ----
// e() ->
```
does not handle strings longer than 32 bytes correctly:
```
// e() -> FAILURE, hex"08c379a0", 0x20, 39, "Transaction failed. Transaction "
```

Is this only an issue with error strings or with strings in general?

This applies to all strings (error strings aren't handled differently):
```
contract C {
    function s() public pure returns (string memory) {
        return "A string that is longer than 32 bytes.";
    }
}
// ----
// s() -> 0x20, 38, "A string that is longer than 32 bytes."
```
Which leads to an exception since the expected value can not be encoded. 

Leaving the expected values empty in order to let the auto-update routine fill them in, results in a broken value:
```
// s() -> 0x20, 38, "A string that is longer than 32 "
```

I think this is solved now

Aren't those strings still split into 32-byte chunks, e.g. "A string..", "is long...".

Yes, they are. But I was thinking back than it wasn't working, so maybe issue is not worth fixing.
