I tried to switch our asan builds to clang in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7206, but this triggered asan errors. I think they might be false positives, but we should look into this.
I think it's the same ones as reported in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6870.
It's a double free of a ``yul::Block`` that was supposedly allocated by ``Scanner::reset`` (which definitely doesn't allocate ``yul::Block``s).

Since the results seem to differ we might consider having two runs, one gcc asan and one clang asan run, instead of just switching to clang...

This will also interact with using the static z3 build in our CI which might cause problems with a clang build due to the OpenMP implementation.

@ekpyron is this issue still open?

Probably?
