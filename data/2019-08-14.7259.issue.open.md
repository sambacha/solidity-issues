# [\#7259 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7259) `open`: Replace boost constructs with their C++17 STL equivalents.
**Labels**: `good first issue`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2019-08-14 18:42](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7259):

Since we switched to C++17 we can replace several boost constructs by their STL equivalent.
This includes, but may not be limited to:
- [x] changing ``boost::regex`` to ``std::regex``
- [x] changing ``boost::optional`` to ``std::optional``
- [x] changing ``boost::variant`` to ``std::variant``
- [ ] changing ``boost::filesystem`` to ``std::filesystem`` (note: this might have to be postponed due to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7263#discussion_r314240318)
- [ ] replace ``boost::program_options`` with ``CLI11`` (suggested by @chfast at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/4612#issuecomment-411027733)
- [ ] check any other feature which is already part of C++17
- [ ] for Boost integer we can use the intx library (already seperate ticket: #3851)
- [ ] with regards to Boost.Ranges we should consider using [ranges-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) that are compatible with C++11/14/17 and is going to be part of C++20, too. (see #10738)
- [x] replace `boost::noncopyable` with deleted constructor/assignments (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7259#issuecomment-561157399)

### Please Note:

Each of those changes should be done in its *own* PR.

@ameyanator Sorry for the late reply - but yes, since it doesn't seem like @Patil2099 is currently still working on this, so feel free to work on this one. Be sure to use a different PR for each change - and we will probably have to stay with ``boost::filesystem`` for now due to problems on MacOS, but the other two are possible now. Best to start with replacing ``boost::optional``.
Let us know, if you start working on this.

Ah sorry, I was away for a bit, so now I realize that there's already a PR for ``boost::optional``.
So the next task would be ``boost::variant``.

@Patil2099 @ameyanator I'd suggest the first one to post a comment like "I'm starting to work on implementing [boost construct]" can take over that boost construct.
Be aware however, that there are more issues connected to this than anticipated (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7467 trying to implement ``boost::option`` and the earlier issues with ``std::filesystem``), and that this is currently low priority for the solidity team, so we will probably only be able to offer limited help at the moment.

@glanderson42 note that, as mentioned above, we might have to stay with ``boost::filesystem`` for now, since there is only limited support for ``std::filesystem`` on MacOS. If you have can test on Mac and make sure it works well there, great, otherwise we need to postpone this part for now.

@ekpyron Thank you! Unfortunately I don't have physical Apple computer for testing. :( 
Otherwise, I'm going to work on ```boost::optional``` replacement.

Hm since we require C++14/17 now, cannot we just replace `boost/noncopyable` with a deleted constructor or we like that it is easy to search for noncopyable?

Yes, some of it was done, as indicated in the issue description.

At least I'd like to have it replaced with deleted constructors and assignment operators. Searching for ``= delete;`` will still work...

I have updated it after asking the question :wink:

I started using `CLI11` in EVMC, and I'm not happy. The API is pretty bad and over-complicated and documentation is out-of-sync (I usually browse the code to figure out how to do stuff).

I'm also consider trying https://github.com/Taywee/args now.

Strictly speaking about libsolidity/libsolc (and not the tests and CLI): `boost:filesystem` is only used via the `absolutePath` and `sanitizePath` helpers in `libsolutil`. Perhaps we could replace those with `std::filesystem` or even with home brew helpers, if that is a useful reduction of boost dependency. I'm not fully sure it is.

@Neyromancer I'm not sure this is a really such a good first issue at this point, mostly because most of these have been tried and stopped on some blocker (dependency management, not working on macOS, not a good replacement, etc.) but you could pick something and try.

I think that `boost::noncopyable` would be the most straightforward. Also introducing more C++17 features to the code base would be nice if you find anything we're not using yet. Maybe ranges v3 would be good too if there are no objections to introducing them now (instead of waiting for C++20). With any of the others, prepare for a bit of discussion regarding the proposed solution because there's no consensus yet. In the end we still want all of these things so if you're persistent enough, any of them is up for grabs.

In case you'd prefer something else after all, please see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7495#issuecomment-731481159. I labeled more issues as `good first issue` and added some recommendations for you.

Even when C++20 comes out, we'll still have the `b_ubu18` build job, don't we? 😬 

i.e. using ranges-v3 could be a good idea.

Actually, I already kind of got clearance from @chriseth to remove ``b_ubu18`` as well as the PPA builds, replacing the latter by static builds, just as we did for "xenial" for a while, so that shouldn't keep us. But we probably still need stuff like ``ranges-v3`` if we want to transition early (which I vote for doing!).

When? This is blocking two of my PRs :)

On gitter some time before I went off... I said I was annoyed by ``b_ubu18``, because the old ``gcc`` in there has some annoying inadequacies, e.g. it doesn't always properly do copy ellision and return value optimization resulting in various weird workarounds in the Yul optimizer - and asked if we could drop it and move the PPA for ubuntu 18 to a static build (which would be built on ubuntu20) soonish - and  @chriseth agreed at the time :-).
