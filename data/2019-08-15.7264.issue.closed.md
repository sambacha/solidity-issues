## Description

clang-10 (unreleased) reports a type conversion error here

https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/blob/ddabf50f72cf369bf652a95c4d9fe31a1865a781/src/lib_json/json_value.cpp#L70-L73

Likely root cause is https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#es46-avoid-lossy-narrowing-truncating-arithmetic-conversions

Would be solved (with quite a big hammer) by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6900 ;-).

This currently fails the fuzzing build. Working on a (temporary) fix.

I have not been able to "hot" patch this so far. The closest I came is to remove the `-Werror=conversion` option here

https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/blob/2cf939e8c37494922ca2991902a0fe50baa2eaea/CMakeLists.txt#L127

Sadly, even I were to add `-Wno-error=conversion` here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/2508cbc1eb417f2fde6aea8a2b036eae96ad990b/cmake/jsoncpp.cmake#L22

it will be undone by the linked cmake because jsoncpp's `-Werror=conversion` follows the options supplied by `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` (see first link)

What happens if you add ``-DJSON_USE_INT64_DOUBLE_CONVERSION`` to ``JSONCPP_CXX_FLAGS``? Even if that works, we'd need to have a close look at what that actually does, though :-).

Nice find :-)

Sadly, I cannot just pass `-DJSON_USE...` to `JSONCPP_CXX_FLAGS` because `cmake-3.14` (version in the ossfuzz docker image) complains of definition not being of `VAR=VALUE` form, and when I do change it to the form it warns me that the passed option is not used by jsoncpp

```
Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:                                                                                   JSON_USE_INT64_DOUBLE_CONVERSION
```

@bshastry That sounds a bit weird... are you sure there aren't just some quotes missing which will make cmake consider it as a ``-D``-style cmake option instead of a list of cxx flags?

Yup, the problem was missing double quotes :man_facepalming:
