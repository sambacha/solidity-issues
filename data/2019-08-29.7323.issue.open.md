# [\#7323 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7323) `open`: Optimization step: remove unneeded masking in mstore8

Replace `mstore8(x, and(y, a)` with `mstore8(x, y)` where `a >= 0xff`.

Note, this would be made obsolete with range tracking where all unneeded masking could be removed.

Note that `bytes memory x; ... x[2] = 3;` is the only place where the code generator uses `mstore8`.

Furthermore, I think the condition is `a & 0xff == 0xff` instead of `a >= 0xff`.

I wrote some hand written code and found this case there.

Yep, correct.
