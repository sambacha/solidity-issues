# [\#7381 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7381) `closed`: [yul] proto fuzzer: Reference objects that are in scope pseudo randomly

## Abstract

The yul proto fuzzer currently generates code like this

```
object "object0" {
  code {
    let y := dataoffset("object0");
  }
  object "object1" {
    code {
       let x := datasize("object1")
    }
  }
}
```

This issue tracks support for generalizing object access such that any object in scope may be referenced. As an example, it should also be possible to reference "object1" sub-object within "object0" code section.

## Motivation

TBD

## Specification

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

TBD

Folding this into #6685 since this required a smaller change than I originally thought.
