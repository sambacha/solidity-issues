In 0.6.0 we implemented array slices for dynamic calldata arrays.
We should also support them at least for dynamic memory arrays and maybe even for dynamic storage arrays. This will require more involved changes, though, since while calldata array slices and dynamic calldata arrays have the exact same stack layout and type conversion is a no-op, this won't be the case for memory and storage.
We could also think about the case of static arrays combined with slicing.
