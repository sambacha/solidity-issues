# [\#7460 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7460) `closed`: Update external tests to 0.6.0

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20012009?u=61e903cf16bc5f3353db1d571401e2e71b6f61ed&v=4" width="50">[erak](https://github.com/erak) opened issue at [2019-09-19 12:16](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7460):

The contracts in external projects we're testing on a nightly basis, need to be updated to the breaking changes of 0.6.0. Since we cannot update the upstream repositories directly, these have been forked:

- [x] https://github.com/erak/colonyNetwork/ (`develop_060`)
- [x] https://github.com/erak/safe-contracts/ (`development_060`)
- [x] https://github.com/erak/openzeppelin-contracts (`master_060`)

The desired workflow would be to create PRs on the forks with every breaking change. After 0.6.0 has been released, we can try to get them merged upstream.

The only project, that has one issue left, is OpenZeppelin: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7784#issuecomment-559974137

@erak isn't this now fully fixed?

@erak @ekpyron are you upstreaming these fixes?

The natspec updates at least don't require 0.6.0 as a compiler so that would make sense to upstream. And probably the inheritance problem in the test case in zeppelin is not strictly 0.6.0 specific.

@axic Yeah, I was planning to create PRs in every repo that we forked.
