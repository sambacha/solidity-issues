## Abstract

Strings have a length. It is not possible to read `length` of the `string` type. You have to convert it first to a `bytes` type.

## Motivation

It is not intuitive that you have to "convert" the `string` to `bytes` to read length. The only reason I can think of is that it is not intuitive if a character in the string is more than one byte length (e.g. special characters) - should we return the char length or the byte length of the string? (Is this the reason that reading `length` of a string is not possible?)

## Specification

Allow us to read the `length` property of the `string` type.

## Backwards Compatibility

This is backwards compatible.

In case that this was not included in the first place because of differences between char length and byte length (due to encoding) this feature request can be closed.

Yes, multi-byte characters are the reason for disallowing access to string length.
