## Abstract

At the moment, we rely on the fuzzer build CI to catch compiler warnings/errors that should be otherwise caught by clang (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7473#issuecomment-534534163).

Now that we have a dedicated clang docker image (see #7248 ), we can use it for this purpose.
