## Description

When building the latest version of the compiler from source (as described [here](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html)), the build fails with the following error message:
```
$ cmake .. && make
...
[ 51%] Building CXX object libsolidity/CMakeFiles/solidity.dir/formal/CHC.cpp.o

make[1]: *** [libsolidity/CMakeFiles/solidity.dir/all] Error 2

make: *** [all] Error 2
```

When Z3 is explicitly excluded (`cmake --DUSE_Z3=Off`), building succeeds.

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest (0.5.11)
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 64bit
- Z3 Version: 4.8.5

Hi @zhao-nan ,
are you sure about the Z3 version? I've seen this error before on Ubuntu, when people use the stock z3 (which is old).
Since you're on Ubuntu, I assume you have a custom installation of Z3 4.8.5. What could be happening is that you have both versions (stock and custom) installed, and CMake is preferring the old one for some reason.

Woops. Yes, you are right. I did not realize the old repo version was also installed.
Thanks for the quick help!
