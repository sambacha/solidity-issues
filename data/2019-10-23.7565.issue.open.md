## Abstract

Auto-generated, public getters for arrays and their cost mechanisms should be explained in more detail.

## Motivation

Came up in external PR https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/7456.

## Specification

https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.12/contracts.html#getter-functions contains a paragraph on array types, which needs more explanation, especially on the difference in gas costs for `eth_call` and a call from other contracts.

@ChrisChinchilla Could you have a look? I think this could be a good improvement.
