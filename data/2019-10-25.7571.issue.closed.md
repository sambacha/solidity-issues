<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).

<!--
Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language
and reason about it.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier,
including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.
-->

## Specification


<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The
specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.
-->

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing
these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.

@tharinduvindula The number of accessible stack elements is a property of the EVM and can't be changed by the compiler. There is a draft EIP that targets this issue though: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-663.md.

Please consider e.g. decreasing the number of parameters and / or return parameters of your function. Most of the times you can work around this limitation by simplifying and modularizing your functions. You can also reach out to https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity for further advice.

I'll close this issue for now, please feel free to re-open if needed.
