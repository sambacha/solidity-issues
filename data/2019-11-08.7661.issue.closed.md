# [\#7661 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7661) `closed`: Improve language security 

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3225772?v=4" width="50">[javabeanz](https://github.com/javabeanz) opened issue at [2019-11-08 11:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7661):

## Description
My impression is that many security vulns now are inherent to the use of solidity; i.e. the language wasn't design with enough Security by Design and by Default in mind. This happens to a lot of new technologies : the rush to get it out there often outweighs security concerns.

To change this could be hard, but at least here are some pointers : http://langsec.org/papers/langsec-cwes-secdev2016.pdf and http://www.cs.ru.nl/~erikpoll/papers/language_based_security.pdf Please let me know if i can help here or that this was useful.
