# [\#7663 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7663) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Support FixedBytes IndexAccess

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2019-11-08 16:33](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7663):

Currently expressions of type `FixedBytes` are encoded as SMT integers, but in Solidity their indices can be accessed individually, returning a `byte`.
One way to support it might be to create an SMT prelude that fills an array of size 32 with the powers of 2.
Then access to index `i` of FixedBytes `b` can be encoded as `(b / 2^(len(b) - i) % 256`.
