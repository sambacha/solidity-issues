**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

Updating contracts in the external projects that we're testing nightly builds of soljson against is huge effort. A tool which can auto-update them to compile with 0.6.0 would be of great help.

We could actually come up with a framework that also finds various patterns (based on a rule set), and reports them (optionally providing replacement-rules). I'm thinking of something like clang-tidy that can do the same when also passing the `-fix` CLI option.

Such a tool couldn't just be used for upgrading language-change related stuff.

Of course, we can start small (with the actual requirement we have, and then incrementally improve such a tool). What do you think?

I've just finished a first proof-of-concept of a 0.6.0 upgrade tool for contracts: https://github.com/erak/solidity-upgrade. For now, it takes a solidity file and the corresponding AST JSON (compiled with `--error-recovery --ast-json`) as input and generates a list of potential changes. Applying these would be the next step. Currently support for abstract and basic suggestions for the read-only length member are in place:
```
interface A {
    function utterance() external returns (bytes32);
}
contract B is A { }
contract C {
    uint[] storageArray;
    function f() public returns (uint) {
        storageArray.length = 33;
    }
}
```
generates
```
Replace(Location(69, 19), "Contract should be to marked as abstract.", "contract B is A { }", "abstract contract B is A { }")
Replace(Location(176, 24), "Length member of arrays is read-only.", "storageArray.length = 33", "while(storageArray.length < 33) storageArray.push();")
```
After some research and fiddling with https://github.com/protofire/solhint, https://github.com/chao-peng/SIF and https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya, I came to the conclusion, that writing a simple tool from scratch would be best, since none of the above seem to be easily extensible to what we need. I've choosen Rust for the POC since parsing JSON is just too easy. We could also implement in C++ or python if that's better for further development.
Let's discuss, if this is the direction we want to go into :-)

Quick update without a PR (yet): I've rebuild the tool in C++, because we can a) use libsolidity directly, without having to export and re-import the JSON AST, and b) maintain it within ease inside the team.
Working version should be ready by the end of next week.

Is this still relevant for 0.6.0?

@axic Moved it to 0.6.1.
