cleanup Parser::instructions() / Parser::instructionNames() (move to EVMDialect instead).

This was done.

@chriseth I think you refer to `libyul/optimiser/SimplifcationRules.cpp` and `Pattern::toExpression` in particular. Why is this a problem btw?

It looks weird. The Builtins-semi-type should just contain the function names directly.

Besides that almost every single use in the compiler does a first conversion to lower, can't we just keep it in lowercase and uppercase it for the single case (assembly output) needing it?
