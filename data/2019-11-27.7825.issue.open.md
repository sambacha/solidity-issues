# [\#7825 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7825) `open`: [SolYul] Enforce left-right top-down evaluation of expressions

All expressions should be evaluated in a certain order and the documentation about this should be changed (currently, it says that the order of evaluation is unspecified).

Fixes https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7820

Do we have an idea which parts of the generator may not be following the left-right top-down rule?

Given https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11537, resp. https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11536 and the fact that function arguments are evaluated right-to-left, I'd say that right-left is the better choice...
