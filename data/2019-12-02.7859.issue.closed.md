# [\#7859 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7859) `closed`: [yul] proto fuzzer: Add evm version field
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2019-12-02 15:45](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7859):

## Abstract

The yul spec should include a field called `evm_version` (hard fork) so that program generation could be targeted at specific evm versions.

## Motivation

One way to do this is to add a protobuf field called evm version and map that to the EVMVersion class. We can then use functions from that class to decide whether to add a specific opcode or not.
