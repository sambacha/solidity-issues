# [\#7931 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/7931) `open`: Extend ABI documentation of function types
**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

The documentation at https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/docs/abi-spec.rst doesn't explain how function types (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.3/types.html#function-types) are encoded.

It includes this:

> function: an address (20 bytes) followed by a function selector (4 bytes). Encoded identical to bytes24.

Can you suggest how to expand this explanation?

Thanks, I missed it since I searched the file for "function type".
One reason why I didn't see `function` is that the list of types is sorted by a mix of history (new types are appended at the end) and significance (often used types are at the top).

I think it would help to sort the types by name.

Also: What is "address" in this context? The contract? If so, how about this:

`function`: an `address`, usually the contract, cast to `bytes20` followed by a function selector (`bytes4`, see "Function Selector and Argument Encoding"). The two are concatenated in order into a `bytes24` function type.

"Function Selector and Argument Encoding" should be a link.
