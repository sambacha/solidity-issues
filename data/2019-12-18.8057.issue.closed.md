@ChrisChinchilla here is a draft for "fallback / receive split". I'll put it here until we have the new repo:

```
Fallback function in 0.5 and prior is used for two different purposes. One of them is safe and rather easy to understand but the second one is a low-level functionality that can easily lead to bugs if not done properly. Because of that, we split the fallback function into two different functions following thes.purposes:

First function: react when being sent ether. Can be used to reject the transfer, emit an event, forward ether (caveat) and other similar things. This is the safe part of the fallback function that is usually the only one that is needed. In 0.6.x, ure the "receive" function for that. The function is called if the contract is invok d without any data, i.e. without a function to be called. .send() and .transfer() call the receive function

Second function: implement proxy contract that forwards function calls. If a contract is invoked but no function in the contract matches the function identifier in the call data, then the fallback function is runs. This allows to implement functionalities that are split across multiple contracts or where the actual implementation of a contract is stored elsewhere.
Example: simple proxy contract

What is the danger in the way it was done in 0.x?
Problem: implement fallback function and only expect it to be called on ether transfers. It will still be run if the intended function is missing from the contract. Even worse: no error will be reported at runtime.
Example: need a good example. The problem is that if a fallback is implemented that takes ether, then it will result in some benefit to the caller. So we could have an example where a contract executes something and takes a fee in ether and you can also send it ether to do something else.
```

Oh and the example at the end should probably also contain two contracts, one that does define the function and one that does not but has a fallback function instead. Then an instance of the "wrong" contract is called from a third contract.

Also, @ChrisChinchilla , the draft is just the collection of points I want to get across, please feel free to completely rewrite it.

Is the article nearing completion or is help welcomed?

Diligence was thinking of writing an update to the Solidity post about `0.6.x` changes. So we're happy to help on this front.

Created the repo to host the articles: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog

@GNSPS no, it's just a draft as of now - but not sure how for @ChrisChinchilla has come until now :)

@chriseth Sorry, was off sick the past few days, will look today.

First draft of first post, needs example added, and then more detail based around that.

As an example, we could use an auction contract that has a `bid` function but no fallback function and a token sale contract that has a receive function. If we confuse the addresses after 0.6.0, we will get a revert. Pre-0.6.0 the token sale contract would only have a fallback function and thus the calling the 'bid' function would cause a token purchase.

To not clutter the solidity repo any further and to keep an easy overview, let's move all blog related issues to the Solidity blog repo. I will copy the list and create a new issue to keep track of everything here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-blog/issues/39

Could also transfer this issue, @chriseth. That way the comments are kept in one place.

The comments are not really needed though / should have all been covered already. But go ahead if you think it's necessary @chriseth. :)

Just mentioned it as a nice feature Github provides, which could come handy in the future. I occasionally use it to move things from solc-js or to move to remix-ide.
