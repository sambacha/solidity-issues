One more occurrence in the same file (perhaps for variable decls) here https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/07a56625e4d07610adbbd493e10d2f419dbc5400/libsolidity/parsing/Parser.cpp#L723

We briefly discussed this in our meeting. We won't remove the `to discuss` label just yet, because maybe @axic want to share some notes.

Summary:
* Makes sense to remove, should also touch VariableDeclaration (wrt. isConstant).

Are we taking this into 0.7.0 or some future release?

@elenadimitrova can we add this to planning?

@christianparpart Can you clarify "should also touch VariableDeclaration (wrt. isConstant)."?
