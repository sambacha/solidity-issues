Reported by @MicahZoltu.
In case there are more than 256 errors, we abort with an exception - but we should at least show the first 256 errors in the exception message.

Reported for 0.5.15.
I haven't confirmed it myself yet.

EDIT: reported for solc-js using standard-json, but I haven't been able to reproduce with our test file, so waiting for more input.

Confirmed. It's triggered by this standard-json input: https://gist.github.com/MicahZoltu/ad87ccf635900d7cde808ed783191627

It's also triggered for the command line interface. I have only verified for 0.5.15 so far, though, and the pragmas in the input need to be adjusted for 0.6 (maybe among other stuff).

When replacing the pragmas with ``sed -i -e `s/solidity 0.5.15/solidity >0.0.0/g'`` in the input file, command line solc 0.6.2 seems to hang...

My guess is that this is related to having more than 256 errors in multiple input files in contrast to our test which only uses a single input file.

Stopping my investigation for now, so feel free to take this up. I'm staging it for 0.6.2.

Asked @aarlt to look into this.
