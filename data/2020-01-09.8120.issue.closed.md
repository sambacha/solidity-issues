# [\#8120 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8120) `closed`: ControlFlowAnalyzer: Check if we can decently report unreachable code without using source locations

``ControlFlowAnalyzer::checkUnreachable`` uses source locations to warn about the source range containing unreachable nodes. If we don't have valid source locations e.g. when importing ASTs this might not work as desired, so we need to check, how it behaves in that case.

It might actually be fine, though - even after importing we should get valid ``start`` and ``end`` fields in the source locations and those determine, what's reported - not sure how the error reporter will deal with this, if there is no valid source text, though - that we should probably check in general.

I think I'm closing this again - I think we can still rely on ``start`` and ``end`` in source locations and if this doesn't work out the damage in not reporting a warning is limited.
