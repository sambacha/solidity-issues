I really like the idea of streamlining error reports. But if Whiskers is the right way to do that, I am not too sure.

My initial motivation was to improve readability of error messages by using semantic colouring, something that would be a convenient argument for using fmtlib (part of C++20's std::format), so that passing custom types to the error formatter could be auto-colorized & pretty-printed without additional effort on the caller side.

This PR seems relevant in this context: #11273.
