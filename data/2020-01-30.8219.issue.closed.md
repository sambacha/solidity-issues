**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`

the regression test is taking over 5 hours and sometimes timing out on circleci. It should be investigated if it has a bug or if we should move it to a different platform, since I don't think circleci is made for such long-running tasks.

The regression tests have been deactivated in #8217
