## Description

This contract:
```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public returns (uint, uint) {
        try this() {
        } catch Error(string memory) {
        }
    }
}
```

produces:

```
Unknown exception during compilation: std::bad_cast
```

when run with solfuzzer (solc alone seems ok)

On master, using AFL fuzzing.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.6.3-develop.2020.2.10+commit.e8eb1f2d.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Save this contract in `shrink.sol` (or whatever filename)

```solidity
contract C {
    function f() public returns (uint, uint) {
        try this() {
        } catch Error(string memory) {
        }
    }
}
```

produces:

```
> solc shrink.sol
Unknown exception during compilation: std::bad_cast
```
