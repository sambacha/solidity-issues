# [\#8335 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8335) `closed`: [Fuzzer] Fix nightly CI

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-02-18 08:09](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8335):

Fix for #8219 (see #8289) did not clone fuzzing seed repository and contained other bugs in the python script such as not correctly checking for failure patterns etc.

This PR hopefully finally fixes the buggy build. Tested in circle ssh. Should bring down nightly CI run to under 6 minutes. If we are happy with this latency, we may consider switching from nightly to regular CI. However, this should be a long-term goal since there are several unfixed syntactic crashes still in the fuzzer corpus.
