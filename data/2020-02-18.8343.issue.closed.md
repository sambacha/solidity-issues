Example (`keccak256` is supported now, but `abi.encode isn't)
```
contract Hash {
    function f() public pure returns(bytes32) {
        return keccak256(abi.encode(1234));
    }
}

@chriseth can we prioritise this?

@axic can you make a checkbox list of which functions exactly?

It seem `keccak256` was added since I've created this issue.

@chriseth added a list, I think it is correct.

I am working on 
Creation, ///< external call using CREATE

SetGas and SetValue are deprecated and we will not implement them.
Is anyone working on `ABIDecode`?

@aarlt said he'll look into `ABIDecode`.

All except 
 SetGas, ///< modify the default gas value for the function call
 SetValue, ///< modify the default value transfer for the function call
is implemented, and those two are not planned, closing the issue
