## Description

This contract:
```solidity
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;
contract C{
    struct S{int56 x;}
    function f(int56,S calldata,bytes2,bytes2,bytes2,int56,int56,bytes2,bytes2,bytes2,int56,int56,int56)external{}
}
```

produces:

```
Exception during compilation: /home/user/solidity/libyul/backends/evm/AsmCodeGen.cpp(215): Throw in function static void solidity::yul::CodeGenerator::assemble(const solidity::yul::Block &, solidity::yul::AsmAnalysisInfo &, evmasm::Assembly &, langutil::EVMVersion, const solidity::yul::ExternalIdentifierAccess &, bool, bool)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<solidity::yul::YulAssertion>
std::exception::what: Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable dataEnd is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Stack too deep when compiling inline assembly: Variable dataEnd is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack.
```

when compiled with solc

On master, using AFL fuzzing.  Another discovery using https://github.com/agroce/afl-compiler-fuzzer, now with a few more mutation operators

## Environment

- Compiler version:  0.6.3-develop.2020.2.10+commit.e8eb1f2d.Linux.clang
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04 in docker

## Steps to Reproduce

Above shows pretty clearly, I think.

It seems that yul function for ABI decoding has additional variables which causes a stack too deep issue.

Stack too deep errors can always happen if there are many function parameters and it can only be detected at code generation phase. @hrkrshnn do you think we should rather create a new exception type that does not translate into an ICE?

@chriseth @hrkrshnn I had filed an issue some time back wishing stack-too-deep errors could be specialized (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/6772) so that the fuzzer can ignore them. If you think that is still a good idea, I can propose a PR for it. However, I do not think that will help here because solc would still fail but with the newly introduced exception type instead of an ICE.

It is fine to fail, but it should not be considered as bad as an assertion failure.

@chriseth @bshastry I was wondering if it's possible to have a compiler error like the following:

```
Compiler error: Stack too deep, try removing local variables.
 --> /tmp/stack.sol:2:5:
  |
2 |     function f(int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int,int)external{}
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```

Getting the original location is a non-trivial task, though.

We have an open issue for at least improving it for regular solidity variables.

This issue is "fixed" by #9281
