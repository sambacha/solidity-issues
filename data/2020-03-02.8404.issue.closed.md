## Description

```
contract K {
  function f() public {
    abi.encode("","","","","","","","","","","","","","","");
  }
}
```

throws 

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/b65a165da19f150fbff39eac08729da72e4216c3/libevmasm/Instruction.h#L259

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): NA

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc <input.sol>
Exception during compilation: /home/bhargava/work/github/solidity/libevmasm/Instruction.h(259): Throw in function solidity::evmasm::Instruction solidity::evmasm::dupInstruction(unsigned int)
Dynamic exception type: boost::exception_detail::clone_impl<solidity::evmasm::InvalidOpcode>
std::exception::what: InvalidOpcode
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Invalid DUP instruction requested (17).
```

@mijovic will be working on this.

We'll turn this into a "stack too deep" assertion with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8420, because that's basically what this is. Unfortunately, there's no really nice solution to catch these before code generation.

Not sure if we should keep this open or close it in favour of the general "stack too deep" problem once #8420 is merged...

Still a problem today, just the assertion is different:
```
/Users/alex/Projects/solidity/libsolidity/codegen/CompilerUtils.cpp(503): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::CompilerUtils::encodeToMemory(const solidity::frontend::TypePointers &, const solidity::frontend::TypePointers &, bool, bool, bool)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::InternalCompilerError>
std::exception::what: Stack too deep(17), try using fewer variables.
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Stack too deep(17), try using fewer variables.
```
