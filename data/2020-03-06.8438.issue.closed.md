Hi! 

I found a problem with the sample code included in [create 2](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-structures.html#salted-contract-creations-create2) sample code.
Looks like the `predictedAddress` function is not working, which makes fail all the process.
I've deployed the exact code to ropsten, verified the source code [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x3e73f9bb40f4855ff88b5c96eb38e7c141c81301) and then calling the `createDSalted` function fails, which reverts the transaction, see [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/tx/0x60151dac147277ccb4038ca5461726cfcda5240f95c5caa7666e9e4438b42922)

Then i've divide the `createDSalted` to just deploy the contract, and have a view function to precalculate the address, and i found the problem is the logic in the `predictedAddress` function in the sample, which fails. The divided contract was deployed [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x6db6715e8dc468ad8fc949021889808a4faf314c

I've still cannot resolve the issue in the address precalculation, i'll investigate it later on, but if anyone can find it, great!

I'm sorry, we cropped the address at the wrong end. If you use `address(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(` instead of `address(bytes32(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(` then it should work.

Great, thank you @chriseth !
