# [\#8488 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8488) `closed`: Separate Solidity and Yul's token list

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/504195?u=ce2facd14af9fd474ebff49f0d44891f56f7500f&v=4" width="50">[leonardoalt](https://github.com/leonardoalt) opened issue at [2020-03-11 17:48](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8488):

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/8486 the problem was that Sol -> Yul used a variable named `var` which should be fine in Yul, but since Yul also uses Solidity's token list, it doesn't compile.

We should find a proper fix for that since this could happen to other keywords as well.
