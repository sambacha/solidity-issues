# [\#8541 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8541) `closed`: Refactor checks on Contracts
**Labels**: `good first issue`

The type checker contains multiple occurrences of
```
		if (noErrors)
			for (Source const* source: m_sourceOrder)
				if (source->ast)
					for (ASTPointer<ASTNode> const& node: source->ast->nodes())
						if (ContractDefinition* contract = dynamic_cast<ContractDefinition*>(node.get()))
```

These should be extracted into some helper "forAllContracts" or something like that, which takes a lambda.

Hi @chriseth ,
Are you talking about libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp ? 
I only see 2 occurrences of it, or are you talking globally, if so, where? 

Thanks,
Reuven.

Yeah, you are right, it is probably not too common. Thanks for checking!
