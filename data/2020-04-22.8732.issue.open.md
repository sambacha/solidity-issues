@yoni206 mentioned that Boolector can solve many of those tests with BV256, so we should try that as well

This shouldn't be hard using `pysmt`, that has a backend for both Boolector and z3 (and others). However, these "no-overflow" operators that you are using would need to be encoded as I don't see them in pysmt.

Oh right, that sounds good.
Yea, I think they are z3 specific

Boolector supports overflow operators, in particular for signed and unsigned addition, multiplication and division. Not via SMT-LIB, but via the API and the BTOR format.

Also supported via the python api of Boolector?
