# [\#8758 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8758) `closed`: Artifacts of generating values to constants remain present in optimized code

Looking through some source code and found this somewhat odd.
In the following contract, compiled with (0.6.6) and the optimizer on,
```
contract A {
  bytes32 public constant a = keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)'));
  function f() public returns (bytes32) {
    return a;
  }
}
```
when fetching the `constant a` in `f`, while the result of the hashing is correctly precomputed and returned in the function, the bytecode still loads the string `'transfer(address,uint256)'` into memory for no apparent reason. Cf. https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core/pull/64

I'm sorry, but this is a know limitation of the optimizer - it currently has no notion of lifetime for memory objects. A proposal to fix this (at least for the new optimizer) is here: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/5107

interesting, thanks
