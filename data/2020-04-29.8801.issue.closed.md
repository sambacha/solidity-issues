# [\#8801 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8801) `closed`: Use the official CircleCI orb for shellcheck

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15704815?u=7756e69444b64cb13550646cd5cb0e36ec10f7fc&v=4" width="50">[davidcian](https://github.com/davidcian) opened issue at [2020-04-29 11:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8801):

In the [CircleCI config file](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.circleci/config.yml), shellcheck is used as follows:
```
chk_coding_style:
    docker:
      - image: buildpack-deps:focal
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install shellcheck
          command: apt -q update && apt install -y shellcheck
      - run:
          name: checking shell scripts
          command: ./scripts/chk_shellscripts/chk_shellscripts.sh
```
It would maybe be interesting to use the [official CircleCI shellcheck orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/shellcheck), especially since the command to install shellcheck is [failing atm](https://circleci.com/gh/ethereum/solidity/310227?utm_campaign=vcs-integration-link&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github-build-link) for some reason.

It would also be perhaps more easily maintainable to use the orb's interface instead of the `chk_shellscripts.sh`.

@christianparpart can you check this, please?

Sorry for the late response. I've been looking into this, and the official orb looks nice, but the interface between is very limited. That is, it allows us to *only* specify one path prefix that will be ignored during checking. Sadly the current `shellcheck` however has a long list of scripts that are actively ignored during testing.

In the longer run all those currently ignored scripts should be fixed instead of ignored. In the meantime, we can either close this ticket, or leave it open and mark it as `good first issue` to leave some oportunity for an external contribution - What do you think, @chriseth ?

In that case, I would say we just stay with the current way to test.
