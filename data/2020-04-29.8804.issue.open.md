# [\#8804 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8804) `open`: Trusted/untrusted contract/function

External function calls to another contract are problematic for formal verification tools because even if the called code is known during static analysis, we can't guarantee that the deployed code is exactly that, unless the analyzed contract is the deployer. In the latter case, we could mark the contract/address that was deployed by the analyzed contract as trusted, so FV tools wouldn't have to disregard constraints on state variables when an external call to that contract is made.

It would be possible to check codehash in the call pre-flight and abort if there's a mismatch.

@leonardoalt can you move this out of the "new issues" column?
