## Description
```
CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake/EthPolicy.cmake:12 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0028 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:8 (eth_policy)


CMake Deprecation Warning at cmake/EthPolicy.cmake:17 (cmake_policy):

  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

What you list seem to be only warnings and not errors. Can you provide the full build log?

@JackHFeng We're going to rebuild the binary because of #9545 and while doing it we'll see if there are actually any issues. But maybe you could provide some more specific information on the errors you're seeing? The output you posted are just warnings and they should not make the compilation fail on their own.
