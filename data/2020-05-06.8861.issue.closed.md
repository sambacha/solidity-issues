# [\#8861 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8861) `closed`: Implement "basic" modifiers using function calls

Basic modifiers of the form `{ some_code; _; }` could be implemented by replacing `some_code` by a function call. This would save quite some bytecode in most of the cases, especially with regards to error messages.

Optionally you could create a function for each modifier code "block" to optimize it further.
It won't be perfect, for example in the following case:
`if(x) _;`

But it can cover more cases.
