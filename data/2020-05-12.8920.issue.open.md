We could call it 'direct transaction cost'  because we do not know what else happens inside the transaction. Transaction cost includes execution cost plus cost for the payload (for the constructor this is the creation code plus constructor arguments, for functions this is function selector plus arguments). Since zero bytes have a different cost, we can assume the arguments to not contain any zeros to get an upper bound.

Is this only about the command line option `--gas`? If yes, should this really be in 'implementation backlog important', since this feature is barely used?
