# [\#8922 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8922) `closed`: Natspec version/kind

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-05-12 23:38](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8922):

It is currently not easy to tell apart userdoc/devdoc and hard to be backward/forward compatible because there is no notion of versioning.

How about introducing two meta fields: `@version` and `@kind`. Since all tags start with non-@ there should be no clash.

Alternatively use the hashmark (#) as a special sign.

`@version` would be 1 for the current version of Natspec.
`@kind` would be `user` for "userdoc" and `developer" for "devdoc".

Can you explain a bit more how `@kind` would be used and why it is needed? `@notice` is the only user doc tag, so it would be kind of redundant.

My description was hastily done so probably not clear enough, I mean these tags to be include in the JSON and not added by the user.

Currently the following JSON is output:
```
Developer Documentation
{
  "methods": {}
}
User Documentation
{
  "methods":
  {
    "f()":
    {
      "notice": "Some function."
    }
  }
}
```

After the change:
```
Developer Documentation
{
  "@version": 1,
  "@kind": "developer",
  "methods": {}
}
User Documentation
{
  "@version": 1,
  "@kind": "user",
  "methods":
  {
    "f()":
    {
      "notice": "Some function."
    }
  }
}
```

Ok, I see! So the idea is to make the kind of the json structure visible even without context.

Yes, and also to have a version so that we can make "breaking" changes to natspec.

We should also have a field to specify the templating language / engine that is used for natspec.

Some further options for version:
- `#version: 1`
- `doc_version: 1`
- `schema: "userdoc/v1"`
- `docschema: "devdoc/v1"`

Decision from call: let's add `version` and `kind`.
