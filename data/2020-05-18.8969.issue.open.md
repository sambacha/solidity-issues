# [\#8969 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8969) `open`: Implement project board automation

Implement automation (maybe through github actions) for the following:
 - newly opened issues should be added to the "Solidity" project board under "new issues"
 - stale issues that are not in the icebox should get a "ping" comment

For adding newly opened issues to "new issues", I think there is already automation which moves all new issues in "Solidity" project to "new issues". We just need to find a way to move newly created issues to "Solidity" project
