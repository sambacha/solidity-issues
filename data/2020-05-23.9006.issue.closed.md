# [\#9006 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9006) `closed`: Sourcemaps have less information after 0.6.3

## Description

Starting from 0.6.3, sourcemaps seem to have less information, at least around `revert`s statements.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.6.2, 0.6.3 and 0.6.8
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): Default
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Plain solc
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: Not relevant
- Operating system: Ubuntu

## Steps to Reproduce

Given this `input.json`:

```solidity
{
  "language": "Solidity",
  "sources": {
    "c.sol": {
      "content": "pragma solidity ^0.6.0;\n\ncontract C {\n  function test() public {\n    revert();\n  }\n}\n"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "optimizer": {
      "enabled": false,
      "runs": 200
    },
    "debug": {},
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "*": [
          "abi",
          "evm.bytecode",
          "evm.deployedBytecode",
          "evm.methodIdentifiers"
        ],
        "": [
          "id",
          "ast"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Compiling it with 0.6.2 and getting `deployedBytecode.sourceMap` for `c.sol` gives this:

```
25:59:0:-:0;;;;8:9:-1;5:2;;;30:1;27;20:12;5:2;25:59:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;40:42;;;:::i;:::-;;;69:8;;
```

While compiling with 0.6.3 (or 0.6.8; the result is the same) results in this:

```
25:59:0:-:0;;;;5:9:-1;2:2;;;27:1;24;17:12;2:2;25:59:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;12:1:-1;9;2:12;40:42:0;;;:::i;:::-;;;12:1:-1;9;2:12
```

Notice that there's no mapping for the `revert()` statement: in the first sourcemap that's given by `69:8`, but there's nothing like that in the second one.

This is due to the revert having become an internal routine. I will create a fix that reduces the source references for these internal routines altogether.

So to clarify, this is information that won't come back, right?

After #9029, it should be similar to how it was before 0.6.3.

Will the fix be released in 0.6.9?

Do you have an intuition of what's going on here? Can we, for example, assume that the unmapped chunk is the translation of the expression that follows the latest mapped one?
