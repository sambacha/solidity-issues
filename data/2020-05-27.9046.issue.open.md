**Labels**: `feature`, `optimizer`

_[This issue has been discussed with @axic, and reported here to be tracked and further discussed.]_

## Description

In the current code generation (even with the optimization enabled with the flags `--optimize --optimize-runs 5000000`), there is still room for improvement of the memory usage for loops.

Specifically, if we have `sha256(abi.encodePacked(arg1, arg2))` in a loop, every iteration consumes new memory entries to store the arguments `arg1` and `arg2`, even if the same memory entries can be reused over the whole iterations.

For example, for [this loop](https://github.com/axic/eth2-deposit-contract/blob/r1/deposit_contract.sol#L78-L84), the first iteration consumes the following entries to store the arguments:
```
memory[128:159] := 64 // the size of arguments
memory[160:191] := <the-first-argument>
memory[192:223] := <the-second-argument>
```
and then the second iteration consumes the following:
```
memory[224:255] := 64 // the size of arguments
memory[256:287] := <the-first-argument>
memory[288:319] := <the-second-argument>
```
and so on.

In the end, the total 3072 (= 32 iterations * 96 bytes per iteration) bytes of memory are consumed to compute the `sha256` function, while the optimized behavior would consume only the 96 bytes for the whole iterations. This ended up wasting ~300 gas unit.

## Environment

- Compiler version: `0.6.8+commit.0bbfe453.Linux.g++`
- Command line flags: `--optimize --optimize-runs 5000000`

## Steps to Reproduce

Compile `https://github.com/axic/eth2-deposit-contract/blob/r1/deposit_contract.sol` with the following command line flags:
```
$ solc deposit_contract.sol --asm --optimize --optimize-runs 5000000
```
Then see the generated assembly code for the aforementioned loop (i.e., code blocks between `tag_123` and `tag_124`).

(I'll provide a minimal example later.)

Note that neither the copmpiler nor optimizer does any lifetime tracking of memory objects. `abi.encodePacked` returns a memory object and thus could be used further down the road, so lifetime tracking is required here if we do not just want to optimize for a special case. There are proposals to do lifetime tracking in the yul optimizer, though.

Just like we have a codegen shortcut for assigning hashes to constants (#4024) and `address.code.length` (#10778), we could have a similar shortcut for the `keccak256(abi.encode*..)` and `keccak256(bytes.concat..)` (see #10903) cases.

We may want to be a bit reserved though, as this will incentivise this pattern, and I think we should add this shortcut if we believe in the long term we can have this done efficiently even without the shortcut.
