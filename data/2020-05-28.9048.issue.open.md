# [\#9048 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9048) `open`: [SMTChecker] Support FixedPoint

Even though Solidity doesn't compile FixedPoint yet, it could make sense for the SMTChecker to support them as Real. Right now they are abstracted as Integers because they're not compiled anyway.
