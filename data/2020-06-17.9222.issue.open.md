# [\#9222 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9222) `open`: Rewrite Yul grammar in ANTLR

And have it also tested like Solidity's.

Should also consider merging the grammar for Yul and "Yul Objects".

Closes #4622.

It is part of the Solidity antlr grammar - can we somehow reuse it?

I just looked at it, but don't think so. Also the Solidity one is very liberal (supports jump labels) as it tries to parse really old sources too.

I have moved the grammar from `yul.rst` and used the low level stuff from `Solidity.g4`.
