# [\#9232 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232) `closed`: "constants" expressions are expressions, not constants.

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40341007?u=73a96d4874c3459748a0af8078fc8d1c5dde6a4b&v=4" width="50">[drortirosh](https://github.com/drortirosh) opened issue at [2020-06-18 15:24](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232):

Constant expressions are left as expressions, not constants.
## Description

a constant declared  as:
```
bytes32 public constant EIP712DOMAIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
);
```
Is re-calculated each time it is in use.

### expected
the value should be converted into a constant value at compile time.

###a ctual
The expression is re-calculated each time the constant is referenced.

### consequences:
- each usage of a "constant" costs ~100gas more on each access (it is still a little better than storing the result in storage, but not much..)
- since these are not real constants, they can't be referenced from a real constant environment (e.g. from assembly, or from another library )

## Environment

-- solc 0.6.10
-- checked in remix, with optimization enabled.

Ah and by the way: You could use `immutable`s until the referenced issues are implemented, then you only pay the gas costs for the computation at deploy time.
