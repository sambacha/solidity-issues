## Description

```
contract C {
        function f() public {
                assembly {
                        function n(i1, i2, i3) -> o1, o2, o3, o4, o5, o6, o7, o8, o9, o10, o11, o12, o13, o14 {}
                }
        }
}
```

Could this be turned into a compile-time error instead?

## Environment

- Compiler version: breaking

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc <input.sol>
```

What is a compile-time error? We can use `assertThrow` but we cannot detect this situation in the analysis phase because the optimizer might inline the function and the problem could go away.

Yeah, I thought as much. I will close this issue in favour of #9281
