In the example below, the assertion is false because `D`'s code cannot be trusted while analyzing `C`. Since `C.d`'s address is a runtime value, it could point to an address that has the same interface as `D` but implements `f` differently, returning a value different than 0.
The only case where the SMTChecker can trust that `d` points to a contract that has the code from `D` is if `C` deploys it. We need to identify that, and only then can use `D.f`'s code for the analysis.

```
contract D {
    function f() external pure returns (uint) {
        return 0;
    }
}

contract C {
    D d;
    constructor(D _d) public {
        d = _d;
    }
    function f() public {
        uint x = d.f();
        assert(x == 0);
    }
}
```

"I wonder what's the best way to have CHC track if we know that the address in a state variable like C c; is of a contract type C for which we know the code (i.e. CHC sees where it is deployed)...

Maybe there's just a boolean flag for C c; that means "contains valid C" and that is initialized to false and set to true on any c = new C()? And then calling c.f() will take the undefined path, if it's false and assume the code of C.f being called, if it's true?

But yeah - maybe we can really just assume that everything named C is actually a C, I'm not entirely sure... it would feel weird to me in any case."

There is a similar case when an external address is cast to a contract/interface type, like `ERC20 token = ERC20(0x2...)`.

I think the nicest would be as @ekpyron says, any contract assignment is untrusted (and should report a warning) unless it is a `new` in the same contract,

I agree.
