# [\#9308 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9308) `closed`: [Yul] optimiser step CSE produces syntactically incorrect code
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

## Description

This test passes but it should not. Related to #9301 in that the fuzzer found this test case first which led @ekpyron to propose the test case in the related issue.

```
{
    let x_1
    x_1, x_1 := f()
    function f() -> o_1, o_2 {}
    let x_2, x_3 := f()
}
// ----
// step: commonSubexpressionEliminator
//
// {
//     let x_1
//     x_1, x_1 := f()
//     function f() -> o_1, o_2
//     { }
//     let x_2, x_3 := x_1
// }
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

## Steps to Reproduce

```
// Copy test to test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/CSE/test.yul
$ soltest -t yulOptimizerTests/CSE/test
```

For the record: even if we just syntactically disallow ``x_1, x_1 := f()`` (which would solve this issue), it may still be worth to independently have a look at the CSE to make sure that the cause of this is rendered harmless with disallowing it.

Or put differently: the CSE could use some kind of assertion here instead of just happily producing invalid code, no matter if we disallow these cases from ever occurring or not.

I think the syntactically invalid replacement happens here

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d72aae20aa356c10a1966a1a2c7d6f36863a2381/libyul/optimiser/CommonSubexpressionEliminator.cpp#L107-L111

because of
  - https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d72aae20aa356c10a1966a1a2c7d6f36863a2381/libyul/optimiser/SyntacticalEquality.cpp#L51-L55 returning true
  - AND the function call being previously assigned to variable `x_1` I think (but not sure)

Please also note that when https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d72aae20aa356c10a1966a1a2c7d6f36863a2381/libyul/optimiser/DataFlowAnalyzer.cpp#L79-L81 is executed

the assignment `x_1, x_1 := f()` in the code above gets treated as an assignment of a single variable (due to the type holding variable names being a set:  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/d72aae20aa356c10a1966a1a2c7d6f36863a2381/libyul/optimiser/DataFlowAnalyzer.cpp#L79)

I'm not sure why the syntactic equality check is *not* triggered for

```
{
    let x_1, x_2
    x_1, x_2 := f()
    function f() -> o_1, o_2 {}
    let x_3, x_4 := f()
}
```

Shouldn't this be simplified to

```
{
    let x_1, x_2
    x_1, x_2 := f()
    function f() -> o_1, o_2 {}
    let x_3, x_4 := x_1, x_2
}
```

or is it because tuple assignments are disallowed in yul unless RHS is a function call?

I don't understand this issue - the test _starts_ with `x_1, x_1 := f()`, right?

The issue here is that we do not have a good definition of the semantics of `x_1, x_y := f()` - is it?

I think the issue is that disallowing `x_1, x_1 := f()` as we now do, will not hide a more serious dormant issue somewhere in CSE. 

I do not yet fully understand why CSE simplified `let x_2, x_3 := f()` with `let x_2, x_3 := x_1`

I think the missing exception was 
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/4e55759144535c6e58df37bc4c6ea67b26531d97/libyul/optimiser/DataFlowAnalyzer.cpp#L82

What happened was that the DFA treated `x_1, x_1 := f()` as if it were `x_1 := f()`. This was then used to simplify the RHS of `let x_2, x_3 := f()` into `x_1` because that RHS is syntactically identical to the value assigned to `x_1`.

The need for this exception is now made redundant by #9321

So can this be closed now or not?

Fixed by #9321
