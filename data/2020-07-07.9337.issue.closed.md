Follow up of #8716.

Pro:
These two units do not seem to be used.

Con:
The current units seem to be spaced out quite nicely:
```
assert(1 wei == 1);
assert(1 gwei == 1e9);
assert(1 szabo == 1e12);
assert(1 finney == 1e15);
assert(1 ether == 1e18);
```

I would approve, but we should ask the community.

Instead of removing we could replace them with
* Szabo -> Microether/ Micro (factor: 12)
* Finney -> Milliether / Milli (factor: 15)

That website seems to base the units on https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-units/blob/master/units.json. This was collection of units based from various sources at the time.

I don't think any of those units are used by anyone. I would strong vote against "micro" and "milli" in any case as those can be mistaken for anything.

there is a point for gwei because it is really common for gas prices but for everything else, you could just use things like `1e12`
