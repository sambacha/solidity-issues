It seems like most people throw away returndata when performing calls. ie.

```solidity
(bool result, ) = someAddress.call{ value: msg.value }('');
require(result, 'some message');
```

It would be nice to be able to do something like.

```solidity
(bool result, bytes memory returndata) = someAddress.call{ value: msg.value }('');
require(result, returndata);
```

That way if the contract we're calling has a descriptive error we can just forward that.

This is a good point and we might add it with enabling user-defined error types.

Something like this seems easy to understand, as long as the parameters of require line up with the return parameter types and order.

```solidity
require(someAddress.call{ value: msg.value }(''));
```
