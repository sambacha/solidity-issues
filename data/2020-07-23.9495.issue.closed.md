Would it be possible to allow the member notation (M.C) when specifying (non-constant) parent constructors ?

This would be useful in the following scenario:
```
// file1.sol

contract C {
  int private x;
  constructor (int p) public { x = p; }
}

// file2.sol

import "file1.sol" as M;

contract D is M.C {
  constructor (int p) M.C(p) public {} // M.C currently not allowed in this context
}
```

For now, I rely on the following workaround, but it's not ideal:
```
import "file1.sol" as M;
import { C as M_C } from "file1.sol";

contract D is M.C {
  constructor (int p) M_C(p) public {}
}
```
