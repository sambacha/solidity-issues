# [\#9500 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9500) `closed`: Run AsmAnalyzer after each yul optimizer test.

## Description

I stumbled over a few yul optimizer test cases that seem potentially incorrect, and I thought it was worth raising an issue here to discuss.

## Test Cases

1. `test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/fullsuite/stack_compressor_msize.yul`

The expected output contains the following function defintion:

```
function foo_singlereturn_1(in, in_1) -> out
{ extcodecopy(1, msize(), 1, 1) }
```

Which causes the following error when compiled:

```
Error: Expected identifier but got reserved keyword 'in'
  --> /tmp/tmp.CT5gEi0NOm:19:34:
   |
19 |      function foo_singlereturn_1(in, in_1) -> out
   |                                  ^^
```

This seems like an example of the optimizer generating invalid code?

2. `test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/expressionSplitter/object_access.yul`

The input to the test contains a `data` object `abc`. Maybe this is just a quirk of the test format that I'm not understanding, but this data object appears to have been incorrectly eliminated from the program in the test output, leading to a compilation failure with the following error:

```
Error: Unknown data object "abc".
 --> /tmp/tmp.jmSwm42qoW:4:15:
  |
4 |      let a := datasize("abc")
  |               ^^^^^^^^

Error: Unknown data object "abc".
 --> /tmp/tmp.jmSwm42qoW:5:15:
  |
5 |      let x := dataoffset("abc")
  |               ^^^^^^^^^^
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: solc 0.6.7
- Operating system: nixos

Nice catch!

The first issue (using keywords) we have actually this discussed under #9330 and there are a few outstanding PRs addressing this.

The second issue we discussed today on gitter. My opinion is we should change the test output/expectation to be in the object format not to miss any details. The input can be flexible and accept both the object and simplified code formats.

ah nice that there is a PR for the first issue already :slightly_smiling_face: 

Switching to the object format for test outputs seems like a sensible fix for the second one :+1:

I think that I may have found two more invalid tests:

1. `test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/varNameCleaner/function_names.yul`

This test produces code with a duplicated variable name which fails to compile with:

```
Error: Variable name f_1 already taken in this scope.
 --> hi.yul:4:7:
  |
4 |     { let f_1 }
  |       ^^^^^^^
```

2. `test/libyul/yulOptimizerTests/commonSubexpressionEliminator/object_access.yul`

This is subject to the same issue with the missing data object issue as the test in the `expressionSplitter` suite.

I think we should maybe just run a validation step on the output as part of the test :)

What would the validation step look like? Many tests do not produce code that can be compiled by `solc`.

As far as I can tell the reasons for this are the following:

- usage of typed yul
- stack to deep errors
- wrong number of args to to opcodes (these are all in the `wordSizeTransform` sutie, and according to @leonardoalt are expected)

The wordSizeTransform is indeed a problem, but I think we can exclude it. For the others, we should at least do run the AsmAnalyzer even if we cannot do full assembly to bytecode.

Issue 2. and https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9500#issuecomment-663874400 have been fixed (via #9572 and #9575).

Issue 1. will be fixed with #9329.

Btw, @xwvvvvwx usually it is better to create separate issues so we can clearly close them in each PR.

Fixed according to the comment by @axic above.
