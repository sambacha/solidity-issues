# [\#9525 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9525) `closed`: Reduce the number of supported escape sequences in the scanner/parser
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `language design :rage4:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-07-27 17:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9525):

Currently the scanner (and the grammar -- the grammar seems actually lenient about it) supports the following escapes for both Solidity and Yul:
- `\'`
- `\"`
- `\\`
- `\b`
- `\f`
- `\n`
- `\r`
- `\t`
- `\v`
- `\uNNNN`
- `\xNN`

These I believe were mostly grandfathered in from C via Javascript: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/escape

I suggest to clean up this a bit and remove the following: `\b`, `\f`, `\v`

Luckily we don't support octal and therefore `\0` :wink:
