# [\#9565 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9565) `closed`: Contract dependencies are not properly calculated when library-internal functions are used
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-08-04 09:10](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9565):

The following code leads to an internal error because we have a circular dependency between `D` and `C` but the compiler does not detect it in the analysis phase:
```
library L{
    function f() internal {
        new C();
    }
}

contract D {
    function f() public {
        L.f();
    }
}
contract C {
    constructor() { new D(); }
}
```
The same behaviour can be observed if `L.f` is replaced by a free function.
