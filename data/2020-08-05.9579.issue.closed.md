# [\#9579 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9579) `closed`: CompilerStack (resp. ``solc --ir``) always runs old codegen, even if only new codegen is required

Came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9162,
related to https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/8722

CompilerStack.cpp L521 unconditionally runs old code generation, resulting old code generation to run even for ``solc --ir`` and if only ir code is requested via standard json.

Wasn't a problem so far and mainly a waste of time, but with https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9162 there will be cases where old codegen throws stack errors, but IR codegen would succeed, but is prevented from trying due to this.

I guess the compiler stack needs a ``m_generateEvmBytecode`` (or sth like that) and a ``enableEvmBytecodeGeneration(bool)`` similarly to ``m_generateIR`` and ``enableIRGeneration`` and those need to be properly set from CLI and standard-json.
