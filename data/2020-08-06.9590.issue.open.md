It would be helpful/essential for verification tools to have access to the Yul ASTs that are generated throughout compilation via Yul.

I'm wondering - is it really essential or would it also work to run solidity in yul mode and output the ast?

Which ast would that be? What I'm imagining is that all the Yul compilation steps could be exported:
- Solidity -> Yul
- Yul -> Optimized Yul
- Optimized Yul -> Dialect Yul (if applicable)

This is called `ir` in standard json, and displayed via `--ir` on cli.

> Yul -> Optimized Yul

This is displayed on cli via `--ir-optimized`.

> Optimized Yul -> Dialect Yul (if applicable)

This is not available yet.

I'm still not sure what this issue is about and what functionality we are really missing here.

As far as I understood, it's about the YulAST, being output as JSON just like our Solidity AST can be exported...

This feature was also requested in #11043.

I believe this issue has its roots in a discussion @acoglio and I had with @leonardoalt .

In order to verify the correctness of specific applications of Yul optimizers, you need the before and after Yul code.

Right now, the "standard JSON" form can contain "ir" and "irOptimized", but those are source code, not ASTs.  Yul surface syntax is unambiguous so that's not too bad.  It does require that we trust the prettyprinter and that we have a formal grammar and parser.  (We have those now.  E.g., the [ABNF grammar](https://github.com/acl2/acl2/blob/master/books/kestrel/yul/language/abnf-grammar-new.txt) could be useful to others.)

However, it would be higher assurance if, in addition to the before and after Yul code, the before and after internal ASTs (that are input and output to the optimizers) could be serialized to the JSON output structure, as @Marenz suggests.

A bit off-topic but since you posted this here, just a heads up that we have made a slight adjustment to Yul grammar recently: #12545. Not sure if it makes any difference to your grammar definition (it might not be 1:1 with yours) but I see you do have `yul-path` there.
