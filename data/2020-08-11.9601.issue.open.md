Currently that function does not support signed values, causing, for example:
`Warning 3944: (110-115): Underflow (resulting value less than -57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968) happens here`.
That number is actually `-2**255`, so it could be better formatted.

Probably the same issue: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9479#discussion_r464505293

Hi, i will try to work on it.

Hi, just to clarify. Should the number `-57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968 `
be transformed to `-2**255 `
or it can also be represented as 
`-0x80 * 2**248`?
Asking because the number `57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968` is now transformed into `0x80 * 2**248`.

In my opinion, if that's the current behavior in the positive case then doing a similar thing in the negative one is fine as well. It's still some improvement.

But, it would be best to just change it in both cases to `-2**255`/`2**255`. Unless there's some technical reason preventing this - I haven't really looked at the current implementation yet so there might be something I'm not aware of.

Also note that after implementing it you should update expectations in tests because that's where these numbers are used currently. But don't do it manually - you can just run `isoltest` and accept the changes it proposes (see [Writing and Running Syntax Tests](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html#writing-and-running-syntax-tests) in the docs in case you haven't yet).

Actually, i think it is technically possible to move from `0x80 * 2 ** 248` to` 2 ** 255` so i will try to implement it.

I just was not sure whether to follow the current implementation or to do it in the way it was written in the task, i.e. which number representation to take as a basi—Å representation. But i understand now.
By the way thank you for the link:)

if this problem does not block anything. i am still working on it. it took a bit more than expected but guess it is only due to personal reasons.

There's no hurry. It would be pretty helpful, especially in cases like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10776#discussion_r559728114 but fixing this is not a priority right now so you can work on it at your own pace.

@Neyromancer Are you still working on it? Do you need any help?

If this issue hasn't been resolved yet, I am interested to work on it.
