There's no use, since "using for" is no longer inherited, is there?
This is strictly speaking a breaking change, but I'd call it a bugfix instead.

I think this is a bugfix, because interfaces were never supposed to allow `using for`, and if they did, that was freak of life.

See https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/contracts.html#interfaces
