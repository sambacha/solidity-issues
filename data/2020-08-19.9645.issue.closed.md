# [\#9645 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9645) `closed`: Implicit conversion from array literals to dynamically-sized arrays

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-08-19 16:03](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9645):

Array literals should be implicitly convertible to both statically-sized arrays of the same type and dynamically-sized arrays of the same type. This could be solved by making array literals their own type. This can be done in a similar way as we handle string literals: The code generator delays the actual conversion until the target type is known. Only then do we decide whether we store the length in memory (dynamic array) or not.

This is part of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/431 - which will probably not be implemented in full.

I want this functionality.   Is it something that will be implemented sometime soon?

Closing as duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11879 (which has more comments by now).
