# [\#9675 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9675) `closed`: [Testing] Auto-generate antlr4 visitor during each fuzzer CI build
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2388185?v=4" width="50">[bshastry](https://github.com/bshastry) opened issue at [2020-08-26 08:58](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9675):

Open question:
  - Should the visitors be generated every time [like we do for protobuf][] OR
  - Should the auto-generated visitors be checked in

I am more for the first option but it looks like there are issues with antlr's C++ runtime generation: specifically it generates partly syntactically incorrect c++ source code (uses `boolean` type instead of `bool`, double semicolon on some lines etc.)
