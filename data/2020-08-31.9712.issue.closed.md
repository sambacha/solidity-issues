# [\#9712 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9712) `closed`: ASTImportTests.sh broken on OS X (readlink: illegal option -- f)
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=4" width="50">[cameel](https://github.com/cameel) opened issue at [2020-08-31 15:19](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9712):

## Description
When running command line tests on OS X, `ASTImportTests.sh` fails:
```
readlink: illegal option -- f
```

This does not interrupt the test and is not counted as a failure due to #9711.

## Environment and Steps to Reproduce
I don't have an OS X machine to reproduce it but I saw it happen on Circle CI: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/7779/workflows/f0154452-154a-4d2e-bced-8c2d2c3307e2/jobs/425012/parallel-runs/0/steps/0-104

Here's the relevant part of the output

Yes, `readlink` is a pain, because BSD/UNIX/GNU differ. @ekpyron and I have complained about this on Gitter a few times :)

Yeah, I did run into these kinds of errors in the past. `mktemp` is another repeat offender :)
Multi-platform CI actually makes finding this stuff manageable but in this particular case #9711 got in the way making it harder to find...
