It started happening in 0.7.2. The failing assertion was introduced in #9670. The PR added support for struct assignments and I think that the fact that assigning to the result of `push()` is another type of assignment that's still not supported was missed.

Simpler repro:
```solidity
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
    uint[] b;

    function f() public {
        b.push() = 1;
    }
}
```

### Output on 0.7.1 (for the simpler repro)
```
Warning: Assertion checker does not yet implement such assignments.

  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
