# [\#9786 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9786) `open`: [SMTChecker] Support selfdestruct

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-09-12 00:04](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9786):

Here's an extremely useful piece of code:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

contract C {
  receive() external payable {}

  function f() public {
     selfdestruct(address(this));
     // Code unreachable here
  }
}
```

While this could be just added like #9782, I wonder what is the best approach for the CHC engine. No more code can be executed in the contract afterwards (at least not in the same instance).

Yea CHC needs to handle it differently, although it won't be hard to implement.

For info:
- `selfdestruct` terminates the current transaction's execution. However, `reverts` in parent internal transactions will undo the destruction.
- after destruction, any call to that contract reverts
- if in trusted mode, balance of contract needs to go to the argument

not quite
```solidity
contract C {
    function destroy() public {
        selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));   
    }
    function one() public returns (uint) {
        return 1;
    }
}

contract D {
    C immutable c = new C();
    // will return 1
    function test() external returns (uint) {
        c.destroy();
        return c.one();
    }
}
```

Right, should be any new transactions.
Sigh this is gonna be tricky to get right I think.
There's also the case where a contract can be redeployed in that address.
