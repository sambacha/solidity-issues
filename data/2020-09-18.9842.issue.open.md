As [discussed on twitter](
https://twitter.com/alexberegszaszi/status/1306681715767865344) auditors are still afraid of the optimiser and currently we only have a [verify brief description hidden within standard json](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/using-the-compiler.html#input-description):

We should create a section under internals explaining all the libevmasm optimiser steps. Later we should extend it with the libyul steps too.

The yul steps do have some documentation in  https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/README.md linked from ~~https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libyul/optimiser/README.md~~  https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/internals/optimiser.html (which in itself has some explanations of the libevmasm optimiser, but I haven't really read it and checked how good and extensive it is)...
The documentation of the yul steps is probably out-of-date and incomplete by now as well, though...

EDITED: wrong link

I'm solely talking about "the documentation" and not files in the repository ðŸ˜‰

I meant "linked from https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/internals/optimiser.html" ;-).

But yeah - might be good to overhaul that one and not merely link the readme in the repository (which I don't think we've been properly maintaining anyways), but rather to move all of that to "the proper" documentation as well. But it's a good starting point in any case.
