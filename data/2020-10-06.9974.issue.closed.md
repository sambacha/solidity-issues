## Description

For the following contract 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0;
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract Test {
  struct S {
    int x;
  }

  S a;

  function setS_mem(S memory ptr) public {
    a = ptr;
  }

  receive() external payable {
  }
}
```

Compiling to JSON with 0.7.1 works, while 0.7.2 fails:

```console
$ solc-0.7.1 --ast-json Test.sol -o .
Compiler run successful. Artifact(s) can be found in directory ..
$ solc-0.7.2 --ast-json Test.sol -o .
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  what():  map::at
Aborted
``` 

## Environment

Solidity versions:
```console
$ solc-0.7.1 --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.7.1+commit.f4a555be.Linux.g++
$ solc-0.7.2 --version
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.7.2+commit.51b20bc0.Linux.g++
```

Looks worse than I thought. It's not just that the AST is being printed wrong. It seems to be missing some items.

Smaller repro:
```solidity
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract Test {
    function foo(uint[1] memory) public {}
}
```

After bisecting, it seems that https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/9882 is the first one to introduce this abort, so it seems related.

Since we agreed in eliminating the "dead code" wrt `GasEstimator::structuralEstimation`, I think this can be implicitly auto-fixed.
