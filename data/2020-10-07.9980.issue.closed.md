## Description

I am running truffle test on some contracts and the truffle tests are failing with 0.7.2+ but pass with 0.7.1. 

The example I am using is the same as the one from #9974.

Running truffle with 0.7.1 succeeds with  

```console
$ truffle test

```

I really don't know how to debug this further (not a JS expert).

## Environment

```truffle version
$ truffle version
Truffle v5.1.47 (core: 5.1.47)
Solidity - native (solc-js)
Node v12.18.4
Web3.js v1.2.1
```

solidity versions: 0.7.3, 0.7.2, 0.7.1

## Steps to Reproduce

Download a small truffle project from [here](http://csl.sri.com/~dejan/bug.tar.gz), then

1. Edit `truffle-config.js` and set `version: "0.7.1"`. Run `truffle test`, this one should pass.
2. Edit `truffle-config.js` and set `version: "0.7.2"`. This `truffle test`, this one should fail.
3. Edit `truffle-config.js` and set `version: "native"`. This one uses a compiled 0.7.3 binary in the path, and should also fail.

I tracked it down. The issue is that Truffle expects to find a `nodes` key inside `deployedGeneratedSources.ast`. If it's not there or is not iterable, it fails.

`deployedGeneratedSources` is a new feature added in 0.7.2 (see #8807/#9053). Now, I don't know enough about the feature to tell if that key should be there or if Trufle should just not expect it and assume `[]` if it's not there.
@chriseth, @haltman-at?

### Details
#### Minimal repro
Assumes that Truffle is installed and uses solc 0.7.3 that it downloads from solc-bin:

```bash
truffle init

cat << EOF > test/All.js
contract('All', function(accounts) {
  it('Test');
});
EOF

cat << EOF > contracts/Test.sol
pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;

contract Test {
    function foo(uint[1] memory) public {}
}
EOF

cat << EOF > truffle-config.js
module.exports = {
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.7.3"
    }
  }
}
EOF

truffle test
```

#### Adding empty `nodes`
Just adding an empty `nodes` array to the json files stored by Truffle as compilation output silences the error:
```bash
truffle compile
mv build/contracts/Test.json Test-no-ast-nodes.json
cat Test-no-ast-nodes.json | jq '.deployedGeneratedSources[0].ast.nodes = []' > build/contracts/Test.json Test-no-ast-nodes.json
truffle test
```

```
Using network 'test'.


Compiling your contracts...

Hi, this would definitely seem to be a Truffle issue.  Would you mind opening an issue [over on Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues) and I'll take a look at it there?  Thanks!

@dddejan The bug has been fixed in Truffle (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/3419). I have tested a new version from `develop` with your snippet and it works for me so I'm closing the issue. Please check it with your contract and feel free to reopen either this issue or the one in Truffle if you find there are still some problems with Solidity or Truffle respectively. Or start a new one if it's something unrelated.
