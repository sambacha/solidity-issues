# [\#10002 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10002) `open`: Should have compiler error for assigning to an item in an uninitialized memory array

The following code compiles without error but it seems to me that the compiler should throw an error because the generated runtime code does not work:
```Solidity
   function test() external pure returns (uint256[] memory _myArray) {
        _myArray[0] = 10;
        _myArray[1] = 12;
    }
````

It seems to me that it should be a compile error to assign a value to an item in an uninitialized memory array, because it doesn't work at runtime.
