# [\#10035 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10035) `closed`: Limit enums to 256 possible values so the contract storage size is fixed at 8 bits

This was originally a part of #9986.

Arguments for adding the limit:
- Having more than 256 values seems like a very rare case. Does it even happen in practice?
- We're not even sure if all tools support enums bigger than 1 byte properly. Enums always taking up just one byte might be a common assumption.
- ~It's a potential blocker for allowing enums to be extended (#9986, if we decide to implement that feature).~

Oh, interesting.

Yeah, it's a simple change and it might be a good first issue but it's already solved. Here's the PR #10035 (currently going through review).

@GeorgeSheridan this is very interesting indeed! Could you identify other issues in this repository to be potentially labelled GFI?

Yeah, we just selected some issues from this repository to make predictions. This tool can also be used on other issues and will be available in the future.
