# [\#10062 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10062) `open`: [SMTChecker] Verify the Circles UBI contract

Let's try to verify it. Made a fork which has the Zeppelin code without imports and SMT enabled here: https://github.com/axic/circles-contracts/tree/smt

- [x] Bug with private fields in multiple files (fixed by #10139)
- [x] Contract types #10141
- [x] Track simple branches better #10142
- [x] Bug with BMC #10144
- [x] Bug with variables touched by `assembly` https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10619

Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10596 to support some inline assembly.
We can't really support `call` besides the invariants in the presence of reentrancy, which we already have. I recently noticed that `call` isn't supported in that case, but it should. Created https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10576 to track that.
In any case, I think implementing those is not necessary for this issue.
@axic can we close this then?

There's also the `Hub.sol` file, which had more issues. It uses `Token.sol` so it was a good first step.

Lots of `might happen` there =/
Found a bug when running on `Address.sol`:

I think the results from `Hub.sol` are ok though.

`seen` here refers to `address[] public seen;` so while technically it could have `2**256-1` elements, it is not practically possible. We really need assertion annotations :)

For `a.push()`, we already add that the resulting length is `< uint.max - 1`, so that you can always push again without overflowing, since that would also not be practically possible (push overflow would also require 2**256 -1 operations). I'd say that similarly, we can add `length < uint.max - 1` for any `.length` access, so that it wouldn't overflow here as well.

Running current develop on `Hub.sol` gives a huge amount of `underflow/overflow/div by 0 might happen here`. It would be good to try to understand why that is.

My guess is again `pow` and the other nonlinear stuff making termination analysis fail and therefore non of the other inductive stuff works.
