## Abstract

Solidity 0.8 is introducing type checking for arithmetic operations, but not for type casting. From my own experience most downcasting is wrapped in SafeMath-like functions in audited contracts. There are some notable exceptions (namely Uniswap v2 TWAP implementation and ABDKMath64x64) which could be managed through an `unckecked` block.

## Motivation

Checking type casting should be done as similarly as possible as checking overflow on arithmetic operations.

## Specification

No new keywords would be required. Reuse `unchecked`.

## Backwards Compatibility

This should be introduced for 0.8, as a breaking change, bundled with the arithmetic overflow checking.

We will re-evaluate this, but it is probably too late to be included since it is a rather complex topic. The conversion rules will be simplified with 0.8, which could make this easier to add.

Adding reverts on casting overflow would be a breaking change. I think this is an important safety check, and it should be done in the next breaking release, but I don't believe that should happen any time soon. In the meantime, we could consider adding a warning for downcasts that are outside `unchecked` blocks.

My only concern would be that this would produce warnings for anyone using our [`SafeCast`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/09e302384a3c77be1b482b18a4e30f88630cfd66/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol) library. But the code is pretty simple and I wonder if the compiler could detect that it's a safe downcast and thus avoid the warning in this case:

```solidity
    function toUint16(uint256 value) internal pure returns (uint16) {
        require(value < 2**16, "SafeCast: value doesn\'t fit in 16 bits");
        return uint16(value);
    }
```

Is there a Warning already?
I think many people are tricked with "0.8.0 is safe with overflows" and are assuming that conversions also should revert if the number overflows the resulting type. That's very dangerous and I saw no big warning on this topic anywhere. Wonder how many contracts are vulnerable because of this type of assumption?

I support for this proposal
