**Labels**: `documentation :book:`

Prerequisite for fixing #9278.

The JSON output of `solc --abi` is documented in [Contract ABI Specification > JSON](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/abi-spec.html#json) but only for contracts. The information returned for libraries differs but the differences are not documented.
