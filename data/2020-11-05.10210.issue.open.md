From #9607: Change source location to cover the entire function prototype, especially when displayed as a candidate for overload resolution failure.

Example of unwanted behaviour:
```
Note: Candidate:
   --> src/Game.sol:156:2:
    |
156 |         function checkPattern(int _x, int _y, CrossState[] memory _pattern,
    |  ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
```

The source location covers the entire function, but the error reported only shows the first line.

I said "function prototype [..] when displayed as a candidate for overload resolution failure" and I think that would be a good change. No point displaying the entire function of course :)
