# [\#10236 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10236) `open`: Optimiser step for extcode* -> code*
**Labels**: `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2020-11-09 13:53](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10236):

This came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/3044#issuecomment-618358552:

It would be useful to have a step which translates `extcodecopy(address(), ..)` to `codecopy(..)` and `extcodesize(address())` to `codesize()`.

However, this change CAN NOT be done within the constructor as these two opcodes refer to two different pieces of data there and are not interchangeable.
