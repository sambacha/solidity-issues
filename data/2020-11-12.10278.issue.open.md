I think it has some features that standard json lacks.

Can you list those? We should add it to standard json.

Maybe I confused this with non-json mode.

@iamdefinitelyahuman could you explain whether you rely on `--combined-json` and if yes, why?

@MrChico likewise, could you explain if moving to `--standard-json` would be debilitating? :)

Brownie uses `--standard-json` exclusively . py-solc-x is just wrapping around solc, so it provides access to `--combined-json` for no reason other than that combined json exists :)

Brownie would not break anywhere if you removed `--combined-json`, so :+1: from me.

I mainly prefer `--combined-json` for it's easy commandline use â€“ I can get all of the compiler outputs of interest with a relatively simply one liner.
As far as I can foresee there would be nothing fundamentally limiting to migrate dapptools to use `--standard-json` besides the obvious labor involved in architecturing everything to support the new format. Many features that have been introduced into `--standard-json` have been neglected in `--combined-json`, so if that pattern is to continue we would probably migrate anyway. 
My preference would of course be to simply get `--combined-json` up to feature parity, as requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10274.

The thing is we have three outputs to maintain:
1. standard-json
2. individual options to solc
3. the legacy combined-json (which predates standard-json)

We can barely keep feature parity between individual solc options and standard-json, and since combined-json is so sparsely used (seemingly only by dapphub), it is hard to rationalise keeping it maintained.

See the various open issues regarding CLI issues.

> @iamdefinitelyahuman thanks for the response! Do you know of any py-solc-x user who makes use of `--combined-json`?

I took a look through some of the listed dependents, most are using the standard JSON interface.  The notable exception is [NuCypher](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher). @KPrasch @cygnusv - care to weigh in here?

@iamdefinitelyahuman @KPrasch and I are working on that, probably will finish moving to standard JSON interface soon

@MrChico could you point me to the places in dapptools where `--combined-json` is used? I am wondering whether the output parsing or the input preparation seems like the bigger hurdle.

The output should be much more nicely formatted (compared to `--combined-json`), but at the cost of more levels of objects.

@axic, it is being called in [`dapp build` ](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/dapp/libexec/dapp/dapp-build) and parsed in a few different places, such as  [`dapp create`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/dapp/libexec/dapp/dapp-create) or (most frequently) in [Solidity.hs](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/hevm/src/EVM/Solidity.hs#L292) of hevm.

@MrChico Looking at `dapp build`, wouldn't that be better off using the CLI options directly, would they output proper files (e.g. #10275)?

It does use the CLI options directly if the `--extract` flag is passed. Not everything that is available under `--combined-json` is available as a direct CLI flag however, for example`--srcmap` does not exist. 
Most of the time, it's quite convenient to have all artifacts in one file though.

Which I get is part of your original point of the maintenance burden. I can investigate migrating to the `--standard-json` format when I have some more time (in about 2 weeks).

OK, having started the process of supporting stdjson, this seems doable. I really miss the pretty printed error messages. I know they are present in the json, but without the nice coloring. To me it would seem appropriate to also display them (pretty printed) in stderr

That is coming in 0.8.0.

The new formatting replaces the old in the `formattedMessage` field. However the colours are disabled, as of now.

What do you mean by stderr? No error/warning should be reported by the compiler apart from things encoded in the JSON response.

By stderr I mean the linux standard IO stream, where errors are outputted in any other invocation of `solc` that doesn't involve `--standard-json`.

I find this a bit unfortunate, but I understand.

On the regular non-standard-json invocations the stderr was coloured for quite a bit already. That does not change.

@axic I have just noticed a problem here. I think that `solc --import-ast` only accepts input produced by `--combined-json ast`. The format of `--ast-compact-json` is different. We should probably provide a replacement before we drop `--combined-json`.

[gasol](https://github.com/costa-group/gasol-optimizer) is another tool that expects input in the `--combined-json asm` format (and also outputs that format).

Looks like `evm.legacyAssembly` is basically the same format if you look at each individual contract but contracts are laid out a bit differently in JSON and it's a part of a bigger JSON structure so it needs at least a simple transformation to be usable.
