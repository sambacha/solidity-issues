# [\#10283 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10283) `open`: Introduce solidity.evmVersion() to query the target EVM
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

Introduce `solidity.evmVersion()` function which returns an enum of `enum solidity.EvmVersion { Homstead, TangerineWhistle, SpuriousDragon, ... }`.

This would mean the `solidity` identifier is reserved for "language magic", but we could consider such functions to be explicitly importable instead from the special solidity source:
```
import evmVersion from solidity; // notice that `solidity` is not a literal, but an identifier
```

This would be useful for implementing features in #10282.

Is there currently any way to query the EVM to find out what version it is?
