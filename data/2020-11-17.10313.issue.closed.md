In isoltest, when we are running in "enforce yul" mode, it should be a hard error if the yul version works but returns something else. Currently, this problem is silently skipped.

I started doing this. Since we still have such tests that are failing due to different results, should I add a flag in expectations that marks such tests?

No, let's just disable them for now. There are more such situations in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10235 already.
