We only have asm.js build for 0.5.17 so it's not present in [solc-bin/wasm](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/tree/gh-pages/wasm). Looks like wasm rebuilds did not include it because they were done before that version was released.

I originally thought that we just need a symlink and wanted to add it now but it turns out we need to actually rebuild it. I'm reporting it to get back to it later.

When this is built, remember to submit a PR in remix to mark 0.5.17 as a wasm build (see https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/pull/1133).

Hello there. Is there any blocker for adding missing build to [solc-bin WASM distributions](https://binaries.soliditylang.org/wasm/list.json)? There is [a published version in the NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc/v/0.5.17) that actually bundles `soljson.js` file in the package. Could somebody check if it fits to the distribution and if so, add it?

@chriseth sorry for pinging and applying necromancy to an old issue discussion. Still, would it be possible to do anything with the missing 0.5.17 WASM release in historical builds archive?

Mostly a matter of time and lack of urgency. Last time I did mass rebuilds it took some fiddling to get stuff below 0.6.0 to build. 

There is an asm.js binary available in [bin/soljson-v0.5.17+commit.d19bba13.js](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/bin/soljson-v0.5.17%2Bcommit.d19bba13.js). Wasm binaries are faster but asm.js are still fully usable. If you're downloading the compiler in a script, you should really have a fallback to `bin/` if you don't find a specific version in `wasm/`.

It's the asm.js binary I mentioned above.

I talked with @chriseth and we decided to try to rebuild it now. So it'll become available soon unless it turns out it needs some wild workarounds to build.

Rebuilt binary is ready: https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/112. It will become available at binaries.soliditylang.org once the PR is reviewed and merged.
