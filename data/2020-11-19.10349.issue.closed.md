# [\#10349 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10349) `closed`: Sol->Yul: string literals should not be converted to memory before stored in storage
**Labels**: `enhancement`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2020-11-19 14:26](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10349):

Assigning a string literal to a storage value should not need conversion to memory before.

There are several similar situations:

 - abi.encode("abc")
 - contract c { bytes m = "abc"; }
 - contract c { bytes m; function f() public pure { m = "abc"; }
 - x.push("abc")
 - in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10759 we copy a literal to memory first before copying it to storage again.
