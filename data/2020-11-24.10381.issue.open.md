Hi, 

I am referencing the conversation #10317 .

It would be nice to have a way to catch errors thrown during `abi.decode` operations. 

Quoting @chriseth:
> Instead of try/catch we should maybe rather have abi.tryDecode? The problem here is how to return the data in the two cases

Also `try catch` might be useful for functions other than `abi.decode` but I will first need to find concrete examples and will report them here in this issue.

I'm starting work on the underlying mechanism for use in `catch`. The problem of exposing this to the user is still how to deal with the actual values in case of an error. We can use a success flag:
```
(bool success, uint value) = abi.tryDecode(ms.data, (uint));
```
but this would make `value` accessible even in case of failure.

Algebraic datatypes (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/909) could be a way around that...

Until we have algebraic datatypes, returning an additional bool might be a good solution. All our types should have a sane zero-value, at least those that can be abi-decoded.

Any update on this issue? Would love to be able to try `abi.decode` without fear of panic.
