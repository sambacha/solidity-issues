# [\#10405 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10405) `closed`: Optimize the IR generation process
**Labels**: `performance :racehorse:`, `optimizer`

Currently the codepath through the IR generator takes >15x time on the average case, and >25x in some other cases.

- Most of the time is spent within the Yul optimizer, more specifically within `DataFlowAnalyzer`.
- While the time spent in `IRGenerate` in comparison is small, 50% of `IRGenerate` time is spent in Whiskers. Which is mostly what it does, but perhaps we can look at the `replace` function.
- Another time consumer is running the Yul optimizer again when compiling the IR to EVM -- perhaps this can be skipped?

We could check if the DataFlowAnalyzer is needed in all the steps. We might also switch off some of its functionality depending on who uses it.

Another idea to improve the performance of the DataFlowAnalyzer:
Currently, it always represents the state of all variables. It might be more efficient to instead just store the processes that modify the states of variables (assignments, etc). And then only determine the value of a variable upon request by analyzing the processes.

This seems to be behaving better now:

```sh
$ time solc/solc --ir --optimize uniswap-v2-core/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol
real    0m3.576s
$ time solc/solc --experimental-via-ir --optimize uniswap-v2-core/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol
real    0m3.789s
$ time solc/solc --optimize uniswap-v2-core/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol
real    0m1.470s
```

```sh
$ time solc/solc --experimental-via-ir --optimize circles-contracts/contracts/Token.sol 
real    0m3.326s
$ time solc/solc --optimize circles-contracts/contracts/Token.sol 
real    0m0.596s
```

Closing for now.
