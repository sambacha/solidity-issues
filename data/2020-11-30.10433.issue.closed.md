## Description

```
contract C {
        ///@return
        modifier m22 {}
}

contract D is C {
        modifier m22 {}
}
```

references a nullptr here

because `returnParamters()` is null.

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

## Steps to Reproduce

```
$ solc test.sol
```

Another variant that triggers a null deref

```
contract A {
        /// @return a
        function g(int x) public{ return 2; }
}

contract B is A {
        function g(int x) public pure override returns (int b) { return 2; }
}
```
