## Description

There is a Note in the Yul documentation that suggests that the data returned by a `REVERT` is not copied to the memory range reserved for returndata. This isn't true of the `CALL` opcode, and I don't believe that Yul does anything to override that behavior, so I think the documentation is misleading here.

(It's the last sentence of the note below)

"If the call fails (it returns 0), nothing is written to that area, but you can still retrieve the failure data using returndatacopy."

The geth handling of return/revert data: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/0b2f1446bbece9bb4e7abef0bf8de1a267aba654/core/vm/instructions.go#L703-L705
