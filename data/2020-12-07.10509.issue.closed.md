# [\#10509 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10509) `closed`: Move modelCheckerSettings back to "modelChecker" under "settings" in standard json
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`

See the discussion in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/10064

This may be a concrete and sufficient solution to simultanously close https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10470, since it would drop the assumption that standard-json input ``settings`` directly 1:1 correlate with metadata ``settings``, but maybe worth another look to see if there is any other inconsistencies there.
