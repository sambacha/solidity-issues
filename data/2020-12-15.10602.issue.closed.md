# [\#10602 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10602) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Analyse overridden modifiers correctly

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-12-15 09:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10602):

In the following example
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;

abstract contract A {
    uint s;

    function f() public mod(s) {}
    modifier mod(uint x) virtual;
}

contract B is A {
    modifier mod(uint x) override {
        require(x == 42);
        _;
        assert(x == 42); // should hold
        assert(x == 0); // should fail
    }

    function set(uint x) public {
        s = x;
    }
}
```
SMTChecker currently fails to report the assertion violation.
The problem is that when analysing `B.f` it fails to resolve properly which version of the modifier will be used and analyses it with the modifier `A.mod` instead of `B.mod`.
