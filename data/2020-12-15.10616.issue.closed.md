# [\#10616 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10616) `closed`: I’ve Lost savings of my life sending erc20 on staking smart contract

I will payout 1000 LINK (13k $) for help in my problem.
I'm just recovering from a terrible loss, I'm a father and husband, and a few days ago I lost my life savings due to one small mistake and rush.  I don't want to bother you with my problems, so I'll go to the details.  I accidentally sent 4,000 LINK worth $ 50k to the Ghst Stacking smart contract that does not support the LINK cryptocurrency chain.  Theoretically, the contract is immutable, and even its creator Nick Mudge admitted it.  However, when I launched the rescue operation, good people came to me who said that there should be a chance to add a LINK sidechain to it, which would allow me to recover all my life savings.  All information is contained on this website www.aavegotchi.com, while cale Aavegotchi agrees to cooperate if it turns out that it is possible to do so.  Of course, it will cover the cost of your work, I think that it is enough money that "hangs" there that we will be able to agree.  I got a link to you as a group that can do Magic.  I am begging you for help.  Dawid Kaczówka from Poland.

I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. Unfortunately I don't think the funds are recoverable. There are two ways it could theoretically be done and both require functionality the contracts are missing.

First, the Chainlink contract could give you your tokens back if it was designed for such an eventuality. Etherscan does not show me the code of their token (just a summary of available ERC20 token functions), but I'm pretty sure that the contract is some version of this: https://github.com/smartcontractkit/LinkToken/tree/master/contracts/v0.6. It's a dead simple contract (as tokens tend to be) and it's designed to do just one thing: keep a big list of which address owns how much. In fact most of the implementation is the battle-tested standard OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract. Chainlink added a few functions to support ERC-677 but that does not change much. I can see no functions that would allow anyone but the owner to transfer funds. And the owner in this case is the Aavegotchi contract.

So the second option would be to make the Aavegotchi contract transfer funds back to you. And there's a ray of hope since the contract that owns the funds is a proxy (implemented as @mudgen's Diamond). If you could somehow get the proxy to register the transfer function of the Chainlink contract as a diamond facet, you (or anyone else) would then be able to call it via the proxy and move the funds as if you were the owner. Aavegotchi, as any diamond, has an admin interface for changing registered functions, called `IDiamondCut`. The thing is, that interface is disabled (commented-out so it can't really be enabled again). That's great for security of the contract but it's also bad news for you. You can't do it that way. You'd have to find and exploit a pretty serious security hole in Aavegotchi to make it possible and I know @mudgen ran a bug bounty on it so even if there were a hole, it would be unlikely to be an easy one to find.

I'm going to leave this open for a moment in case anyone else on the team wants to chime in but I don't want to get your hopes up. I wish you luck but I think that recovering it is pretty much impossible.

One more thing. If, against all odds, you do find a way to recover the funds by registering the transfer function with the proxy, please be wary of frontrunners. You might think that if you just quickly enable it and don't tell anyone, you'll be able to quickly transfer it back to your account and no one will have enough time to even notice. This logic does not work on the blockchain. From what I've heard, generalized frontrunners that watch every transaction and check if replacing your address with theirs will benefit them, are pretty widespread. As I said above, the transfer function would be available to anyone so a frontrunner could easily snatch the transaction from you. You can fool them by obfuscating the transaction (e.g. splitting it into two parts in a commit-reveal scheme) but you have to be smart about it.

He is correct about the diamond,   but as he mentioned the IDiamondCut
interface was not added to the diamond so it isn't possible to add new
facets to the diamond.    He is correct that we would have to exploit some
security hole of which I know of none and doubt that there is any  because
I reviewed the contract and we had it audited by a security firm and held a
bug bounty

I guess this is one benefit of upgradeable contracts.   If the diamond had been upgradeable then the money could be returned.   But since it is not upgradeable it looks like the LINK token is going to be stuck in the diamond forever.   

**Note:** A diamond is an Ethereum contract that implements this contract standard [EIP-2535 Diamond Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).

Here are links to related source code in case anyone can find a way to return the funds:

Nie jesteśmy :) Tzn. tylko ja jestem a projekt jest międzynarodowy więc w bugtrackerze obowiązuje angielski. W razie czego możesz pisać po polsku na maila z mojego profilu.

Well, I can see it's very a big hit for you so I'll give it a try. I have enough work for the rest of the week but I can give it an hour or two on the weekend and see if there's anything I missed. But like I said, everything here seems very solid so really, please don't put too much hope in it as I'm pretty sure I won't find anything. GHST and Nick's contract were audited and the Link contract could hardly be simpler. From the link you gave me I see that it's an older version of the token (still running on Solidity 0.4.x) and maybe it is affected by some long patched security issue in the compiler but again, that's not something I would count on.

You didn't learn. In what universe do you think a small mistake like that could crush your entire life? Not to mention all the hacks and scams threats. I am not sorry anymore for you, you seem irresponsible.

As far as I can see @dawidkabani13, the contract has the ability to add different staking facets. Add me on discord: yegres #7183 
With this custom facet we potentially can pull out the LINK. Now please message me and we will try to proceed with the contract owners

I am also very sorry about the issue, but this has become reality tv and I think we should close/lock the issue. The information will still be public and reachable, but I don't think this is the right place for such discussions.
