<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.
-->

## Description
For the following example
```
abstract contract A {
    bool s;

    function f() public view mod {
        assert(s); // holds for C, but fails for B
    }
    modifier mod() virtual;
}

contract B is A {
    modifier mod() virtual override {
        s = false;
        _;
    }
}

contract C is B {
    modifier mod() override {
        s = true;
        _;
    }
}
```

The compiler reports the following warning:
```
Warning: Unreachable code.
 --> /Users/mblicha/projects/solidity/build/test.sol:4:34:
  |
4 |     function f() public view mod {
  |                                  ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).

```

This warning is very confusing and most likely also incorrect. I would expect this to be compiled without any warning.
<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.7.5, also current `develop`
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): N/A
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): N/A
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client: N/A
- Operating system: MacOs 10.13

## Steps to Reproduce
Just compile with `solc`.
<!--
Please provide a *minimal* source code example to trigger the bug you have found.
Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

Reduced the example to
```
abstract contract A {
    function f() public view mod {
        require(block.timestamp > 10);
    }
    modifier mod() virtual;
}
```

The assert can be replaced by a `require` but not by a regular statement.
