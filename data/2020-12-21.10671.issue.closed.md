# [\#10671 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10671) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Incorrect analysis of virtual function call
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16404346?v=4" width="50">[blishko](https://github.com/blishko) opened issue at [2020-12-21 15:07](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10671):

False negative in the following example:
```
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
contract A {
    int x = 0;

    function f() virtual internal view {
        assert(x == 0);
    }

    function proxy() public view {
        f();
    }
}

contract C is A {

    function f() internal view override {
        assert(x == 1);
    }
}
```

SMTChecker (CHC engine) does not report any problem.
However, the call to `C.proxy()`calls `C.f()` (using the virtual function call mechanism) where the assertion is violated, so an assertion violation should be reported.
