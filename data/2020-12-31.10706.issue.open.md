I have a style of dealing with over/underflows in Solidity that works like this:

Very often I use large enough variables in contexts where it is impossible to overflow and/or underflow them. Therefore I don't need to use SafeMath or default reverts from Solidity 0.8.0.

In cases where using large enough variables to prevent overflow/underflow is not possible I use explicit require statements or other custom logic to handle. I found that doing this better expresses the algorithm being implemented and can give better error messages.

I have found it important to be aware of and understand each mathematical operation that occurs in a contract and if it can over/underflow and the consequences if that happens and handle accordingly. Reverting on under/overflow is not always the right action and can result in locking funds in contracts forever. So it is important to be aware of and understand each potential over/underflow and handle it correctly.

With this style the default revert on under/overflow from Solidity 0.8.0 is not used and requires me to run all my mathematical operations within `unchecked` blocks.  **I would like to request a `pragma unchecked` or similar directive that turns off default reverts on over/underflow for the whole file.**

Besides supporting the style I mention above the pragma could make it easier and faster to port older Solidity code to Solidity 0.8.0.

Please, please, please implement this feature.
