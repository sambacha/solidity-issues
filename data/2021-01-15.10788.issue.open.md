What kind of invariants? Can it detect that a memory struct declared inside is invariant?

If you write a property that represents that, it could.
But what I mean is:
```
y = 0;
while (y < x)
  ++x;
assert(x == y);
```
`y <= x` is an inductive invariant for the loop, that is, it is true every time the condition is checked.
The assertion is proved by "replacing" the loop by its inductive invariant and adding the negated condition as a constraint after the loop: `y <= x && y >= x => y == x`
