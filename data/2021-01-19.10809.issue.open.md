# [\#10809 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10809) `open`: Optimizer: Function Constraint Summarizer
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`

Once we use a reasoning engine to remove redundant checks and other things, we need to know constraints on the return values of some builtin functions: `calldatasize` cannot be too large, `address` is also bounded and so on.

It might be very beneficial "forward" this information through user-defined functions in a similar way as we do for the SemanticInformation. Maybe we can even compute simple linear relations between the inputs and the outputs and use that to "summarize" the function.

These relations might have to include memory and storage, and this is where it could get difficult. For example
`allocate(s) -> p` can be summarize to `p <= mload(0x40) + s + 0x20` (where `mload` queries the pre-state).
