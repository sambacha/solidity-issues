# [\#10839 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10839) `closed`: Linux binary for version 0.4.10 in solc-bin was built from a different commit than binaries for other platforms
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `solc-bin`

[solc-linux-amd64-v0.4.10+commit.f0d539ae](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/gh-pages/linux-amd64/solc-linux-amd64-v0.4.10+commit.f0d539ae) identifies itself as:

``` bash
./solc-linux-amd64-v0.4.10+commit.f0d539ae --version
```
```
solc, the solidity compiler commandline interface
Version: 0.4.10+commit.9e8cc01b.Linux.g++
```
Note that the commit hash is different than the one in the name.

This affects produced metadata and therefore also bytecode:
``` bash
echo "contract C {}" | ./solc-linux-amd64-v0.4.10+commit.f0d539ae --metadata -
```
```
{"compiler":{"version":"0.4.10+commit.9e8cc01b"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[],"devdoc":{"methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"<stdin>":"C"},"libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":false,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"<stdin>":{"keccak256":"0xec5627577fc5b8010229a1036827ef0739fb21bb05b7bf259947acdded145877","urls":["bzzr://851401d5a4f7ae83d237aa6fda2e11331e2cf3c76d8a733bdd5d8ee6c93500f7"]}},"version":1}
```

All the other 0.4.10 binaries in solc-bin correctly report the commit hash as f0d539ae (including the macOS one included in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/76).

The problem affects the Linux binary included in [v0.4.10 github release](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.10) as well - the files are identical.

Decision from the call today:
- We're going to rename the file to match the commit it was built from.
- We'd prefer to have a Linux binary built on `v0.4.10` (which points at f0d539ae) but we think it's not worth the effort. I could try if someone requests it but given how many workarounds I had to do for the old macOS builds, it will likely not be as straightforward as just checking out `v0.4.10` and running `make`.
