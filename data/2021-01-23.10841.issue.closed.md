# [\#10841 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10841) `closed`: Binaries for versions  0.4.7 and 0.4.8 in solc-bin produce different bytecode on different platforms
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `solc-bin`

In 0.4.7 and 0.4.8 version strings in metadata produced by the binaries contain platform name. This results in different bytecode on different platforms.

This is not an issue in versions <= 0.4.6 because they do not include metadata hash in the binary. In versions >= 0.4.9 version string does not contain platform name.

Not producing the same bytecode on all platforms creates issues with source verification like the one reported in #10183. Unfortunately I don't think we can do anything about this case. Any change in the source would change the hash so we can't backport the fix from 0.4.9 even if we wanted to. I think we'll just have to discourage people from using them.

Should we do something more to prevent them from being used by default? I don't think that removing them completely is a good idea but we could for example move them to a different directory in solc-bin so that they're still available but not included on the list of binaries that tools use?

### Version strings in metadata
Note: We have no Linux builds for these versions and the macOS builds I used are the ones from https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/76.

#### 0.4.7
| Binary                                             | Version in metadata                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `solc-emscripten-asmjs-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf.js`  | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Emscripten.clang`  |
| `solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf.js` | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Emscripten.clang`  |
| `solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf.zip`    | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Windows.msvc`      |
| `solc-macosx-amd64-v0.4.7+commit.822622cf`         | `0.4.7+commit.822622cf.Darwin.appleclang` |

#### 0.4.8
| Binary                                             | Version in metadata                       |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `solc-emscripten-asmjs-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.js`  | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Emscripten.clang`  |
| `solc-emscripten-wasm32-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.js` | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Emscripten.clang`  |
| `solc-windows-amd64-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.zip`    | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Windows.msvc`      |
| `solc-macosx-amd64-v0.4.8+commit.60cc1668`         | `0.4.8+commit.60cc1668.Darwin.appleclang` |

#### 0.4.9
For comparison, on 0.4.9 metadata contains `0.4.9+commit.364da425` on all platforms.

Decision from the call today: we're leaving them in solc-bin.
