## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->
```
contract C {
  int[] data;
  function f() public { (data.pop)(); }
}
```

throws

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c7dfd78e57c5ad7abd485dc1cc13d8f0ab09d431/libsolidity/codegen/ExpressionCompiler.cpp#L1020

I suspect something is wrong with parsing `data.pop` (minus the parentheses)

## Environment

- Compiler version: latest develop

I think the best fix here would be to retrieve the type of the array from the function type instead of the expression. This means the array type needs to be stored with the function type - that probably needs another field in the function type.
