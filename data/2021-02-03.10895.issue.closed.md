<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of information requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
	- [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
	- [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported.
- The issue should be reproducible with the latest solidity version; however, this isn't a hard requirement and being reproducible with an older version is sufficient.

## Description

<!--Please shortly describe the bug you have found, and what you expect instead.-->


```
contract c{ function f() public{ fixed a; a <<4;}}
```

throws

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7405dc5b7fa511626946591595d53c4bb0b28d41/libsolidity/codegen/YulUtilFunctions.cpp#L390


Shouldn't it throw unimplemented assertion instead because fixed point type is not yet implemented?

## Environment

- Compiler version:
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix):
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system:

## Steps to Reproduce

Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

Reopening because

```
contract C{function f()public{fixed x;(x>>0);}}
```

when ```solc --ir test.sol``` throws

Oops, looks like `fixed` type shift amount also leads to a different failure

```
contract c{function f()public{fixed a;a<<a;}}
```

throws

These fixed point failures are just annoying. All they need is adding another assert.

Maybe the fuzzer can be configured to ignore fixed point declarations somehow, at least until fixedpoint type is properly implemented?

They can be selectively ignored if they throw a specialized assertion. However, current fuzzers don't have a notion of fixed point type. Grammar based fuzzing is in the works but it is going to take a while :(

Created another PR, checked for both left and right shift
Hope this time it will fix it finally :)
