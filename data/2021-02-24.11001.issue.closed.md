Minimised to the following test case

```
contract C {
  struct Record { uint m; }
  mapping (string => Record) m_nameToRecord;
  function f(string calldata key) external returns (Record memory) {
     return m_nameToRecord[key];
  }
}
```

Actually, a struct is superfluous. The following throws as well. It looks like the bug has something to do with the mapping indexed via a key that resides in calldata.

```
contract C {
  mapping (string => uint) m_nameToRecord;
  function f(string calldata key) external returns (uint) {
     return m_nameToRecord[key];
  }
}
```
