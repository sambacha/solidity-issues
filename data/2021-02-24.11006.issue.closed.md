It seems we do not have include the error codes in the standard json yet. They are now displayed on the CLI via the `--error-codes` setting. This suggest to me we are willing to share those codes, so perhaps we should include it in the standard json. I suggest the field name `errorCode` or `code`.

@axic Are the codes really missing? It looks like we do have them already in standard JSON:

`test.json`:
```json
{
	"language": "Solidity",
	"sources":
	{
		"":
		{
			"content": "contract C { uint[] constant c; }"
		}
	}
}
```

Command:
```bash
solc --standard-json test.json | jq --indent 4
```

Output:
```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "component": "general",
            "errorCode": "1878",
            "formattedMessage": "Warning: SPDX license identifier not provided in source file.

            "severity": "warning",
            "type": "Warning"
        },
        {
            "component": "general",
            "errorCode": "3420",
            "formattedMessage": "Warning: Source file does not specify required compiler version! Consider adding \"pragma solidity ^0.8.1;\"\n\n",
            "message": "Source file does not specify required compiler version! Consider adding \"pragma solidity ^0.8.1;\"",
            "severity": "warning",
            "type": "Warning"
        },
        {
            "component": "general",
            "errorCode": "9259",
            "formattedMessage": "DeclarationError: Constants of non-value type not yet implemented.\n\n",
            "message": "Constants of non-value type not yet implemented.",
            "severity": "error",
            "type": "DeclarationError"
        }
    ],
    "sources": {}
}
```

EDIT: Tested the 0.8.1 release binary but looks like they've been there since 0.6.10.

I think you are right, I looked at [the formatError helper](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L51) and  I missed the extra line in [formatErrorWithException](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/interface/StandardCompiler.cpp#L138).

It also seems to be included in the documentation.
