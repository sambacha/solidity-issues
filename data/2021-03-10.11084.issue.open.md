# [\#11084 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11084) `open`: Change the "runs" parameter to "goal"
**Labels**: `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-03-10 19:47](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11084):

Questions about the runs parameter come up many times (e.g. [1](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=5dd19f14fd6fe41fc0a0a2a5), [2](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev?at=60411fe422a5ce4a9132fb16)). Many cases people think runs here equals to the number of optimizer runs.

The `runs` parameter is described as "Estimated number of calls per opcode oven the lifetime of the contract." in the source code. If we strictly look at the runs parameter meaning the above, then the default of 200 means "the contract will be executed around 200 times" (of course it is more subtle than that). This probably is a good average value for a contract wallet. It is not a good value for a popular app.

I have not seen too many contracts where people changed from the default 200 (one notable exception is the eth2.0 deposit contract).

It perhaps may be better to consider a new setting instead: optimize for deploy-time-cost (i.e. `runs=1`) or run-time-cost (i.e. `runs=<large value>`). What is unclear what is the good "runs" value and whether very large numbers make any difference.

@ekpyron also mentioned the new low-level inline uses the same setting. Also things like Optimism (which injects code adding quite a large overhead to every single state accessing opcode) could benefit if this new setting would control the level of inlining in the codegen and optimisation steps (i.e. controlling code size).

Renaming "runs" sounds like a good idea. It's rather confusing currently. What levels / numbers are we going to pick?

Just my personal experience: the meaning `runs` was pretty clear to me from the beginning and `goal` sounds very vague. Maybe it would be better to choose something clearer but still preserving the original meaning (unless we go for a new setting and just remove it altogether)? Unfortunately I can't think of anything as succint as `runs`. Some ideas:
- `--target-call-frequency=200`
- `--expected-usage-level=200`
- `--expected-lifetime-calls=200`
- `--optimize-for-run-count=200`

Renaming it indeed sounds good, but also not sure about ``goal``. I guess ``goal`` would not be an integer, though, but rather a string like ``lowRuntimeCost`` or ``smallCodeSize`` or sth like that?
If we want to keep it at an integer: internally we call it `expectedExecutionsPerDeployment` and that does make sense.
It  might also make sense to provide both a high-level mechanism like "goal=lowRuntimeCost" as well as low-level access to `expectedExecutionsPerDeployment` as optimizer detail, idk.

If we are looking for a new name, I suggest  `tuning` or `optimizer-tuning`. The name automatically makes people look for its meaning somewhere in the docs, unlike `runs`.

"size-cost-tradeoff"?

In the discussion today the idea came up to have a special setting that tries to find the largest value for "runs" that still keeps all the involved contracts inside the code size limit. This could be a binary search that only repeats the steps that depend on the parameter, although that could be difficult as soon as the yul optimizer is used.

I'd really like to understand this all a bit more, other than the solidity docs is there anywhere that can show empirically how this switch affects output and what are the major proponents of size increases when the runs are set higher? 

Sorry if this is a simplistic request, I'm trying to learn more and normally learn better with practical examples than pure compiler theories :-)

@michaeljohnbennett You'll probably need to compile contracts with different values for `--optimize-runs`. Then deploy and call some functions. You can notice the difference in gas costs for them; both deployment and for each call. If you are more keen, look at the assembly code: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/analysing-compilation-output.html or the IR `--ir-optimized --optimize`. If you have questions, then https://app.element.io/#/room/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im is the right place to ask.

Thanks @hrkrshnn, I did some more testing locally just on the compiler side and can see some of the changes.

It would be interesting to have some kind of test harness you could run an set of values in and return the values back in some meaningful way/graph, array of amounts. 

There isn't anything like this? An optimal sizing script? It doesn't seem a terribly complex thing to do.

1. Iterate over a set of runs values (100-10000)
2. For each one calc contract costs
3. for a set of public calls calculate the gas costs for a simple set of params
4. record the data in some tabular format for each iteration and save to disk or tabulate.
