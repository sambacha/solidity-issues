# [\#11120 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11120) `open`: Natspec: change parameters and return values to be an array
**Labels**: `protocol design :crystal_ball:`

Based on #1141. I thought there was a specific issue, but couldn't find it.

One of the main complaints I had is that parameter handling is not well thought out.
```solidity
  /// @param a first
  /// @param c third
  /// @param b second
  function a(uint a, uint c, uint b) {
  }
```

```json
{
   "methods" : {
      "a(uint256,uint256,uint256)" : {
         "params" : {
            "a" : "first",
            "b" : "second",
            "c" : "third"
         },
      }
   }
}
```

The problem is that the signature does not contain the name of the parameters, and the `params` field only contains a mapping and not an ordered list. This means JSON libraries are free to order the entries as they wish, potentially changing the order based on the lexicographic value of the key.

The proposal is change to the `params` (and `returns`) to be an array, where each entry is a mapping of `{ name: .., description: ...}`.

Sounds good! What about the return variables?

I think the same rules as for params? With the exception if the return value is not named, the `name` field is omitted?

Potential output:
```
      "params":
      [
        { "name": "a", "description": "first" },
        { "name": "b", "description": "second" },
        { "name": "c", "description": "third" },
      ]
```

```
      "returns":
      [
        { "name": "a", "description": "foobar" },
        { "description": "barbaz" }, // this is an unnamed parameter, so the name field is omitted
      ]
```

not to be pedantic, but could the "param" be changed to "name" so that code that consumes both arrays be reused more easily?

Sorry that was a typo, it supposed to be `name`.
