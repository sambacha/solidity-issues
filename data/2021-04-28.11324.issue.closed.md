# [\#11324 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11324) `closed`: Distinct YulHexStringLiterals from common Yul string literals while reproducing the source code

## Description

Since Solidity 0.8.4 release there is [a support for `YulHexStringLiteral`s](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11173) (`let x := hex"11"`, the [commit](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commit/7eb5e27e54c3ffc0e0a1e6d9b6c50e992df6886b) for reference). While making attempts to reproduce the original source from compiler-provided AST, I met two issues with new literals:
1. Unable to distinct common string literals from `hex""` ones, as there are no markers in Yul AST. It is hard to decide if Yul string literal should produce the source code as common string or `hex""` notation. In Solidity AST there is a `"kind": "hexString"` and/or `"hexValue"` entries that was helping with that.
2. Unable to decode the value of `hex""` literals from JSON output and get the original bytes, that was supplied in input source. See common Solidity hex string literal and Yul hex string literal examples for `hex"112233445566778899aabbccddeeff6677889900"` ([link](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/7eb5e27e54c3ffc0e0a1e6d9b6c50e992df6886b/test/libyul/yulInterpreterTests/hex_literals.yul#L2)):
```js
// Solidity
{
    "hexValue": "112233445566778899aabbccddeeff6677889900",
    "id": 15,
    "isConstant": false,
    "isLValue": false,
    "isPure": true,
    "kind": "hexString",
    "lValueRequested": false,
    "nodeType": "Literal",
    "src": "224:45:0",
    "typeDescriptions": {
        "typeIdentifier": "t_stringliteral_72dfaffeee45e650295b39194e71fce8dd7c225413cd7084c2de1e0a7b9f6057",
        "typeString": "literal_string hex\"112233445566778899aabbccddeeff6677889900\""
    }
}
// Yul
{
    "kind": "string",
    "nodeType": "YulLiteral",
    "src": "581:45:0",
    "type": "",
    "value": "\u0011\"3DUfwșʻ̝wș\u0000" // <- The value requires an additional processing to get the original bytes
}
```

I understand that the intention was "_to support syntax at all_", but the AST is also "kind of" important and I guess "producing source from AST" is somehow [the expected usage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree#Usage). I believe it may look like a feature request, but the other part that the source code is not producible from AST itself properly looks like a bug. Anyway, the Solidity team should decide if this should be a bugfix or feature implementation. If this would be a feature, can the team suggest a temporary workaround?

Both the Solidity and the Yul AST lose information when they are generated from source and we do not see the reverse operation (generating source from AST) as a use-case of the AST. Since you lose information anyway, is it that important to re-generate the correct kind of string? You also won't be able to determine if certain characters were escaped in the original string, for example.

The internal Yul AST does not contain the distinction anymore because it is not needed for code-generation, so I would be hesitant to add it.

@chriseth The "_correct kind of string_" is the exact wording for what was asked for. So far, there were no issues with code reproduction from AST, as all of the nodes were containing all the necessary **compatible** information to produce source that would result the same bytecode. It does not really matter if some details are changed while they are still _readable_ and producing _same results_. With current Yul AST I was not able to achieve this.

I, sure, understand that AST is an abstract representation that loses some details (whitespace and some other, that may be expressed differently), however it is also widely used to analyze, instrument and modify code. It additionally serves for the purpose to indicate certain meta-details of the code structure. These are the nice features of compiler-provided AST. Would these arguments be enough motivation to keep such AST quality level?

@chriseth I think the problem is that the Yul AST seems ambiguous in this particular case. Perhaps if you clarify what the semantics of the string inside the `YulLiteral` node of the Yul ast is?

Is it always just the string itself utf-8 encoded? Or does it change depending on whether the original string was a normal string or a hex string? In the case of normal `Literal`s there is different behavior which is why we wondered.

Regarding your second point about seeing generating source from AST as a use-case for the AST, I guess we (https://github.com/consensys/scribble) are the first consumer that use it in that way. However I think the exact semantics of the `YulLiteral` strings migth be of interested of other non-source-generating consumers, such as slither for example.

I currently cannot see any different behaviour about the AST output in the Solidity case.

For Solidity Literal has the fields `kind`, `value` and `hexValue`. `hexValue` always contains the hex encoding of the string literal's decoded contents. `value` is non-null if the string literal's decoded contents is valid utf8 and it is the utf8-encoded contents.

For Yul literals, the mechanism to detect whether it is valid utf8 is missing, so the string just contains (hex) escapes in that case.

Or is this what you meant by "different behaviour"?

So as far as I can see, neither in the Solidity case nor in the Yul case is there any different encoding of the value depending on whether or not the original literal was specified as a hex literal. In the Solidity case, the `value` field is omitted if the actual content cannot be encoded in utf8. What is different in Solidity is that `kind` has the values `number`, `string` ,`unicodeString`, `hexString` and `bool`, while in Yul, it can only be `number`, `bool` and `string`.

Let me clarify something, that I probably missed in the starting post (and sorry if it caused too much confusion). Lets add few code lines to the reproduction sample script (`index.js`):

```js
// console.log(JSON.stringify(parsed, undefined, 4)); // Comment compiler output

const literal = parsed.sources[fileName]
    .ast            // SourceUnit
    .nodes[1]       // ContractDefinition
    .nodes[1]       // FunctionDefinition (testAssemblyHexLiterals)
    .body           // Block
    .statements[0]  // InlineAssembly
    .AST            // YulBlock
    .statements[1]  // YulVariableDeclaration (let b := hex"112233445566778899aabbccddeeff6677889900")
    .value;         // YulLiteral

console.log(literal);

console.log("Original value", literal.value);

const bytes = new TextEncoder().encode(literal.value);

console.log("Decoded bytes", bytes);
console.log("Decoded bytes (as HEX)", Array.from(bytes, (byte) => byte.toString(16)));

const hex = Array.from(bytes, (byte) => byte.toString(16).padStart(2, "0")).join("");

console.log("HEX string", hex);
```
The output:
```
{
  kind: 'string',
  nodeType: 'YulLiteral',
  src: '581:45:0',
  type: '',
  value: '\u0011"3DUfwșʻ̝wș\u0000'
}
Original value "3DUfwșʻ̝wș
Decoded bytes Uint8Array(20) [
   17,  34,  51,  68,  85, 102,
  119, 200, 153, 202, 187, 204,
  157, 238, 191, 166, 119, 200,
  153,   0
]
Decoded bytes (as HEX) [
  '11', '22', '33', '44',
  '55', '66', '77', 'c8',
  '99', 'ca', 'bb', 'cc',
  '9d', 'ee', 'bf', 'a6',
  '77', 'c8', '99', '0'
]
HEX string 11223344556677c899cabbcc9deebfa677c89900
```
While in the original input source has `112233445566778899aabbccddeeff6677889900`. There is something special happening with bytes since `88`... I tried to rely on [common approach](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57391629) to check if the AST node value is actually corresponds to something that we have in the code and JSON serialization/deserialization not messed things up. Maybe I'm doing something wrong or missing something, ofcourse. If so, could you (or somebody from the team), please, give a hint what is wrong here?

If there would be an original value from source and the `"kind": "hex"` switch, then there would not be so much problems.

Thanks in advance.

This is certainly weird. I think we should at least add a hex value, so that we do not get into some json coding mess.

It seems that the fix is part of [Solidity 0.8.5 release](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/06/10/solidity-0.8.5-release-announcement/). I will check and close the issue in near future. Thanks.
