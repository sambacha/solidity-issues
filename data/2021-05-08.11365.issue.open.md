To avoid problems like #11358 we should make the bytecode check script (#10838) cross-platform and start running the check on Windows binaries as well.

In #10838 I added a bytecode check for old releases in solc-bin. The goal was to verify the rebuilt macOS binaries. I thought it would be a waste not to reuse in some way it so I also hooked it up as a PR check for newly added binaries but this was just a low priority side-task and spending more time to get it to run on Windows as well did not seem like a good idea. It's a bash script so it will likely not run out of the box on Windows, though we could try our luck with `bash.exe`. A more robust alternative would be to rewrite it in Python.
