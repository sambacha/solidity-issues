# [\#11436 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11436) `open`: Support namehash at compile-time
**Labels**: `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

In order to at least somewhat support ENS (we cannot fully support it because that creates issues with source verification), we could have compile-time evaluation of the namehash function on string literals.

```bytse32 node = namehash("abc.def.eth");```

Duplicate of #6956 ?

Maybe duplicate, but could also be sub-issue.

Suggestion: implement UTF normalization as a compiler builtin and implement namehash in the standard library.

Pro: This would allow us to gain experience with the standard library.
Con: Unless we actually have compile-time evaluation of pure functions, this would still generate some runtime code (which hopefully would be optimised, i.e. the recent keccak256 optimiser steps).

The alternative to this is #1650 and have namehash supplied via JSON.
