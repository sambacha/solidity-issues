From https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11451
We already report most contract invariants, but some of them (example: `crypto_functions_same_input_over_state_same_output.sol`) have nested quantifiers. Since bound variables only have an index and are defined by quantifier scope, they need a bit more care when being translated into `smtutil::Expression`. As a first step we left that out of that first PR, and it should be done in a different one.
