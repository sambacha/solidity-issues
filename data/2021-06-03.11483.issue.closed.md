# [\#11483 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11483) `closed`: Overridden modifiers are ignored in control flow analysis resulting in missing uninitialized storage error.

Example:
```
contract A {
        function f() mod internal returns (uint[] storage) {
        }
        modifier mod() virtual {
                revert();
                _;
        }
}
contract B is A {
        modifier mod() override { _; }
        function g() public {
                f()[0] = 42;
        }
}
```

The analysis only visits ``f`` in ``A``, in which the modifiers reverts, the function never returns, hence there is no uninitialized storage return error.
In ``B``, however, since the modifier is overridden, ``f`` can return, but is not visited again, so there is no error and the uninitialized storage return can actually happen.

For the purpose of uninitialized storage returns it'd probably best to ignore modifiers altogether.
The only thing they can do is always revert, which is a weird thing for them to do anyways.

This will also affect uninitialized access, not only uninitialized returns.
