**Labels**: `documentation :book:`, `outsourceable`

As mentioned some time ago in #9175 it would be amazing to have a "Tour of Solidity" to run developers learning Solidity through the most important concepts and features in a quick click-through explanatory "course". 

The only two tours that I could find are:
- Erik's Tour of Solidity: https://github.com/erak/solidity-tour
- Certik's Tour of Solidity (using Sol 0.5.x): https://solidity-tour.certik.org/Basics/1

Both are quite outdated and incomplete. 

It would make sense to have such a tour since we know that the main resource people use to learn are actually our docs and learning games such as CryptoZombies.

This task could be outsourced or bountied possibly.
