# [\#11564 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11564) `closed`: Refactoring: Replace CharStream in SourceLocation by name / source index

The source locations need to drag around CharStreams to reference the source files so that they can conveniently extract the text they refer to. This is a needless complication and could create problems later on when we do not have the source code anymore.

Replacing the CharStream by the SourceIndex does not work nicely because due to imports, the source index changes during parsing, so we should store the source name instead (probably a string_view, but maybe also a reference).

Whenever the text of the source reference is requested, either the full source text or the source name -> source text mapping has to be provided.
