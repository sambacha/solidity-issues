# [\#11587 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11587) `closed`: [SMTChecker] Out-of-range exception
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

```
==== Source: s1.sol ====
pragma experimental SMTChecker;
function f() {
  (ecrecover("1234", 1, "0", abi.decode("", (bytes2))));
}
==== Source: s2.sol ====
contract C {}
```

Reproduction

- Copy test contents to a file called `test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/test.sol`

```
$ isoltest -t syntaxTests/test
```

I have not been able to reproduce it without the SMT pragma and hence the title.

Looks like it started in 0.8.4. The error is:
```
Unknown exception during compilation: map::at
```

Reproducing it does require two separate files. It does not fail without the one containing `contract C {}`. It's probably related to the pragma deprecation and the switch to global SMT settings.

Coincidentally enough the same issue trying to use SMTChecker on 0.8.6 in a hardhat project. It didn't have any `pragma experimental smtchecker.

I just found a different crash while playing with this example. Not sure if the cause is the same or not. Started on 0.8.4 as well.

- `a.sol`
    ```solidity
    pragma experimental SMTChecker;

    function f() {
        ecrecover("", 1, "", "");
    }
    ```
- `s1.sol`
    ```solidity
    contract C {}
    ```

```

Yea it should be the same. I'll add it to the PR to see.
