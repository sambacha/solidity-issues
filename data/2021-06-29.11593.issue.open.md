# [\#11593 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11593) `open`: Remove abi.encodePacked
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `language design :rage4:`

`abi.encodePacked` was introduced in 0.4.22 as a backwards compatibility measure for the irregular "packed" encoding.

Since then we have introduced `bytes.concat` (#10903) and learned that most projects (rightly) do not rely on the packed encoding, but only concatenation. I suggest we drop `abi.encodePacked` in the next breaking release.

(We could consider introducing a message with #11508 if we want to test the waters ðŸ˜… , but would rather refrain from this.)

Which types can be used with `encodePacked` that cannot be used with `bytes.concat`?

Arrays. https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.6/abi-spec.html.

What is the effect of this proposal on event index encoding?

Event index encoding will not change, since we only plan to remove `abi.encodePacked` from the language.

Is packed encoding of arrays used in the real world?

One place where it can be used is for EIP-712 hashes - https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#definition-of-encodedata.

For example if there is a struct that contains an array:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MultiTransferDemo {
    struct MultiTransfer {
        uint256 id;
        Transfer[] transfers;
    }

    struct Transfer {
        uint256 amount;
        address recepient;
    }

    function hash(MultiTransfer memory mt) public pure returns (bytes32) {
        return
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    keccak256(
                        "MultiTransfer(uint256 id,Transfer[] transfers)Transfer(uint256 amount,address recepient)"
                    ),
                    mt.id,
                    hashTransfers(mt.transfers)
                )
            );
    }

    function hashTransfers(Transfer[] memory transfers)
        public
        pure
        returns (bytes32)
    {
        bytes32[] memory hashedTransfers = new bytes32[](transfers.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < transfers.length; i++) {
            hashedTransfers[i] = hashTransfer(transfers[i]);
        }
        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(hashedTransfers));
    }

    function hashTransfer(Transfer memory transfer)
        public
        pure
        returns (bytes32)
    {
        return
            keccak256(
                abi.encode(
                    keccak256("Transfer(uint256 amount,address recepient)"),
                    transfer.amount,
                    transfer.recepient
                )
            );
    }
}

```

It can also be implemented via bytes.concat, but I'm not sure which version has better performance:

```solidity
    function hashTransfers2(Transfer[] memory transfers)
        public
        pure
        returns (bytes32)
    {
        bytes memory encodedTransfers = new bytes(0);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < transfers.length; i++) {
            encodedTransfers = bytes.concat(
                encodedTransfers,
                hashTransfer(transfers[i])
            );
        }
        return keccak256(encodedTransfers);
    }
```

As a real world example, this use of `encodePacked()`:

https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/merkle-airdrop-starter/blob/83d6c65d00a10b40e0abdd84a5afa692553a9e72/contracts/src/MerkleClaimERC20.sol#L66

Would need to use casting to do the same thing:

```
keccak256(bytes.concat(bytes20(a),bytes32(value)));
```

Would it be considered more 'idiomatic' to use bytes.concat and cast from `address` and `uintX`?

I think that `address` is actually something that should be allowed as input in `bytes.concat()`. It does have an unambiguous binary representation and an explicit cast to `bytes20` should not be needed.
