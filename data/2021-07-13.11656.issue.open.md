# [\#11656 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11656) `open`: Yul Optimizer: Improve redundant assign elimination in the presence of (nested?) loops.
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`

Came up while looking at `test/libsolidity/semanticTests/abiEncoderV2/calldata_array_dynamic_static_short_reencode.sol` (since that's a test with high stack pressure).

At the time of writing, the following passes as "full optimizer suite" test:
```
{
    let tail := 42
    for { let i := 0 } lt(i,5) { i := add(i, 1) }
    {
	let pos := tail
        pos := tail
	let tail_1 := tail
	for { let j := 0 } lt(j,6) { j := add(j, i) } {
		pos := add(pos, 2)
	}
	tail := tail_1
    }
}
// ----
// step: fullSuite
//
// {
//     {
//         let tail := 42
//         let i := 0
//         let i_1 := i
//         for { } lt(i_1, 5) { i_1 := add(i_1, 1) }
//         {
//             let pos := tail
//             pos := tail
//             let j := i
//             for { } lt(j, 6) { j := add(j, i_1) }
//             { pos := add(pos, 2) }
//             tail := tail
//         }
//     }
// }
```
(Note that both ``i`` and ``j`` can be removed and the loop conditions replaced by e.g. ``1`` or ``callvalue()`` for similar results, I just put them in to have the test case not be too artificial)

Both ``pos := tail`` and ``tail := tail`` are redundant.
Actually, even more so, ``pos`` and ``tail`` are even entirely redundant and could be eliminated altogether :-).

My guess is that due to the loops, this will never end up in a nice SSA form and thus the redundant assign eliminator cannot work properly, but I haven't investigated in full.
