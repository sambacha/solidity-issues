# [\#11670 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11670) `closed`: [CI] Optimize our CircleCI machine sizes
**Labels**: `build system :building_construction:`, `performance :racehorse:`

In our CI config we only use `medium` and `xlarge` machines. There's probably does not give us the best cost/performance ratio. We should try optimizing it a bit.

See [list of all available machine types](https://circleci.com/pricing/#compute-options-table).

On the call with CircleCI people we've been recommended to try the larger Windows and macOS machines to speed up CI runs. Currently we're using `medium` instances and there are larger ones available. Not sure if that's because larger ones weren't originally available or if we just decided smaller ones are most cost-effective. We should at least try them out and compare performance and cost (if we haven't already)

Also, we have some jobs that do not require much processing and only make use of one core. For example the ones I'm adding in #12181 and #12165 but I'm sure there are more. These can very likely be switched to `small` without affecting the total runtime too much.

Finally, we should make sure that all the linux jobs that use `xlarge` actually do benefit from it.

Please check first if we are using all the cores on the machine. I think the intent back then was that windows and macos failures are rare and thus it is not a big deal if the tests take a bit longer to run.

It would somehow be nice if we could select the machine based on the type of test run: For PRs and releases, it might be important to run quickly, for regular develop builds not so much. Also for PRs, we could default to "slow run" unless specified otherwise.

If we switch from medium to large, we get double the amount of cores and double the RAM for triple the price. Not sure if that is worth it.

OK. If that's the pricing then it's probably not worth it. I assumed their pricing would be more linear :)

That's true for Windows but looks like for macOS the cost/performance scaling is more linear (double cores+RAM = double price). So its seems worth trying.

Anyway, after working with CI today I realized that our machine allocation in general could be better optimized. We never use `small` even though there are some jobs that are pretty light and only use one core. I have updated the title and description to make this issue more general.

### Observations
- Most jobs don't use all CPU cores. We can safely give them smaller machines.
- I found only two cases where a bigger machine significantly speeds things up:
    1. **Arch Linux**: We do not set `MAKEFLAGS` so the build does not even use the 2 cores it has in `medium`. Even with that a `large` machine makes it significantly faster.
    2. **Windows**: `large` is 2x faster than `medium`. `xlarge` is a faster than `large` but not by much. I'd recommend switching to `large`. It is indeed 3x more expensive but I think the trade-off is still good enough. We'll be saving a ton on other jobs so we can spend some of these savings on faster Windows builds.
- Interestingly, switching to `large` on macOS does not help at all. Maybe the number of parallel jobs is hardcoded somewhere outside of CI config? `MAKEFLAGS=-j10` does not help. Might be worth investigating.
- Some jobs take less time on `medium` than in the original run (which is also `medium` in most cases). I think this is because some jobs were missing `MAKEFLAGS`.

### Questions
- We have `codecov` check in the nightly run but I have never seen it fail and our codecov config is not very effective anyway. Do we actually need it? It's relatively heavy (`xlarge` machine for build and test takes 1h on `medium`).
    - Maybe we should rename `b_ubu_codecov` to` b_ubu_debug`? That's what it basically is.

### Details
<details>

- The original test run was on top of a branch containing commits from #12214 (not the same exact branch but close).
    - It also ran the nightly jobs as PR checks so that I could include them in the tables.
    - On top of that branch I created separate branches for different resource classes.
- `t_ubu_ossfuzz` job from the nightly run was failing in all runs.
- Values in each column do not come from the same run in all cases. Getting proper averages over multiple runs would be a lot more work and I had to rerun with fixes a few times. Instead I tried to choose fairly representative values that give a good picture of the situation. Values come from these runs:

        - in (2), (3) i (4) machine sizes are not uniform: I had to rerun with larger `b_` jobs to in cases where there were crashes - to check if the dependent `t_` jobs can still work on smaller machines. Also, only (4) had proper `MAKEFLAGS` set.
    - `optimize-ci-resource-class-medium`: [1](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20111/workflows/367c2c98-1205-40cb-b074-8a44d12a293c), [2](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20118/workflows/8f3cea7b-153b-40a0-979b-2a71264ca120), [3](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20129/workflows/cee3bddd-1d8b-43df-897c-94571230d4ca), [4](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20133/workflows/b9493799-eaa4-429b-98ff-c3405acbf9ec)
        - (1), (2) and (3) were run with `MAKEFLAGS=j10` which made some jobs run out of memory and crash just like on `small` machines. In (4) I reran with proper `MAKEFLAGS` and there were no crashes. The table has only values from that run.
    - `optimize-ci-resource-class-large`: [1](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20112/workflows/99b33cb2-426e-474e-b22f-425953757d67), [2](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20117/workflows/dc3bb759-3c64-45b5-9279-d41663eb4cc0)
    - `optimize-ci-resource-class-xlarge`: [1](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20110/workflows/c7edf275-0564-4199-8dc6-ab1a4b1ba536), [2](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20116/workflows/2c3673ce-50bf-4213-ab98-eece6811dbc6)
    - I took Windows and macOS values from various jobs (their resource classes do not match Linux ones). Also from `multicore-soltest-sh`: [1](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/solidity/20132/workflows/0e637521-46bf-4af9-90aa-ef4b899131c9).
        - Some runs had 2x longer run times for Windows jobs because I made a mistake when adjusting the options that set number of threads. I did not use those.
