# [\#11677 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11677) `closed`: ICE in `CompilerUtils::convertType()` when converting a calldata slice of `bytes` or `string`
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `should compile without error`

## Description

Hello all,

in the contract below, there seem to be an internal compiler error in solc 0.8.6 version.

contract C {
	function f(string calldata data) external pure returns (bytes memory) {
		return abi.encode(bytes(data[:32]));
	}
}

## Environment

- Compiler version: solc 0.8.6
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings):0.8.6
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): Remix
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:0.8.6+commit.11564f7e
- Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Steps to Reproduce

<!--

Please also mention any command line flags that are necessary for triggering the bug.
Provide as much information as necessary to reproduce the bug.

Thanks!

Looks like it has started in 0.8.5 so it must be related to the new `bytes` conversions introduced there.

Smaller repro:
```solidity
contract C {
    function f(string calldata data) external pure {
        bytes(data[:32]);
    }
}
```
Works fine if `bytes` is used in place of `string`.

The reverse conversion also fails the same way:
```solidity
contract C {
    function f(bytes calldata data) external pure {
        string(data[:32]);
    }
}
```

Just wanted to mention that this is also a problem with Sol->Yul. The following assertion fails when `solc --experimental-via-ir test.sol`

It seems at this point this is _only_ a problem with the yul backend.
The old codegen doesn't seem to call `fromType.isImplicitlyConvertibleTo(targetType)` like the new one.
