Looks like there's a problem with locating Boost libs on your system. I see that at least headers are there so it's not necessarily that they are missing.

1) Could you make sure that boost libs actually exist? On my system they're in `/usr/lib/libboost_program_options.a` and `/usr/lib/libboost_program_options.so.1.76.0`. I think our default config uses the static one.
2) Could you take a look at the linker command being used and see if paths are correct there? For example for `solidity-upgrade` executable you'll find the command inside `tools/CMakeFiles/solidity-upgrade.dir/link.txt` in the build directory.

actually, I reinstalled gcc, upgraded from 4.8 to 5.x finding out it required the minimum of 8.0, and got 10.1.
hence boost was upgraded altogether.

That's not necessary. Looks like CMake does find the lib files inside `/usr/local/lib/` and properly includes them in the linker command. The problem must be somewhere else.

There's something weird going on. Linker gets the right file but does not see the symbols. Here's some more things to try:
- I see that you're running some commands as root. Could you make sure that the lib files are readable by a normal user? What are their permissions and which user owns them?
- Could you make sure the files are not corrupted? Do they have non-zero size? What do you see if you run `ar -t /usr/local/lib/libboost_program_options.a`? On my system it prints this:
    ```
    cmdline.o
    config_file.o
    options_description.o
    parsers.o
    variables_map.o
    value_semantic.o
    positional_options.o
    utf8_codecvt_facet.o
    convert.o
    winmain.o
    split.o
    ```
- If you're building boost from source, could you try installing it with a package manager instead?

Did you compile Boost using the GCC version you had before upgrading it to 10.1? If so, this might be your problem.

[GCC Manual > Dual ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html)
> If you get linker errors about undefined references to symbols that involve types in the `std::__cxx11` namespace or the tag `[abi:cxx11]` then it probably indicates that you are trying to link together object files that were compiled with different values for the _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI macro. This commonly happens when linking to a third-party library that was compiled with an older version of GCC. If the third-party library cannot be rebuilt with the new ABI then you will need to recompile your code with the old ABI. 

You do have `std::__cxx11::basic_string` in your error messages so I think that's it and recompiling Boost should resolve it.

I have recomplied Boost, nothing worked. I used system package, still no success.

It seems unlikely that this is the problem.

The `yum` command shows that boost was already installed. Could you please clean the boost and install again? Also surprised that the package manager is installing boost 1.53 (that was released in 2013) Perhaps some components in your system are outdated?

I tried the entire thing on another newly made CentOS8.4 (gcc 8.4.1, cmake 3.18.2, boost 1.76) and it just worked fine.
