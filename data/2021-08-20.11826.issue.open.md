# [\#11826 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11826) `open`: Getters returning structs can not be defined in interfaces

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20340?v=4" width="50">[axic](https://github.com/axic) opened issue at [2021-08-20 09:05](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11826):

```solidity
interface I {
    struct S {
        uint a;
    }

    function s() external returns (S memory);
}

contract C is I {
    S public override s;
}
```

The function `s` can not be defined in a way this works. The problem lies in the impossibility to define a working location.

`S storage` is not allowed in interfaces, but that could be one option:
```
Error: Data location must be "memory" or "calldata" for return parameter in function, but "storage" was given.
 --> struct-interface.sol:6:36:
  |
6 |     function s() external returns (S storage);
  |                                    ^^^^^^^^^
```

`S memory` is not allowed by overriding, but that could be equally correct:
```
Error: Overriding public state variable return types differ.
  --> struct-interface.sol:10:5:
   |
10 |     S public override s;
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Note: Overridden public state variable is here:
 --> struct-interface.sol:6:5:
  |
6 |     function s() external returns (S memory);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Oops, forgot that struct getters return the members, and not the struct itself. That is super unintuitive.

Don't forget that if the struct has arrays those are ignored.

Could also consider displaying the return types in this error.

Can we change that at *some* point :-)?

Even weirder that this goes only one level deep. You can have a getter returning a struct if it's nested inside another struct.

For example this compiles just fine and both the function and the getter return `S`:
```solidity
interface I {
    struct S {
        uint a;
    }
    struct WrappedS {
        S s;
    }

    function s() external returns (S memory);
}

contract C is I {
    WrappedS public override s;
}
```

Anyway, you should update issue the description to say what we want to do about it. Do we want to make getters return structs instead of tuples (breaking change I guess?). Or just make the message more explicit?
