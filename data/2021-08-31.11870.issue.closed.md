This came up in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11861#discussion_r699457642.

## Abstract
If you search the repo for `Disabled because of Spacer nondeterminism`, you'll see that we have quite a few SMTChecker tests where assertions had to be disabled due to results not being deterministic between platforms. The workaround is to comment-out these assertions, which disables them on all platforms and weakens our test suite.

In most cases the results are different just on macOS and I think that it would be better to have a mechanism for skipping the whole test on the specific platforms where we're aware of the non-determinism.

## Specification
Add a soltest directive called `skipPlatforms` that accepts a list of values. Values can be: `macos`, `windows`, `linux`, `emscripten` (I don't think we need more granularity than that). When a test is executed, it should be skipped if the directive contains the name of the current platform.

Example usage:
```solidity
contract C {}
// ====
// SMTEngine: all
// skipPlatforms: macos, windows, linux
// ----
// Warning 6328: (1-5): CHC: Assertion violation might happen here.
// Warning 4661: (1-5): BMC: Assertion violation happens here.
```
