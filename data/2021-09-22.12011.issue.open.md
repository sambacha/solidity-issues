# [\#12011 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12011) `open`: Support `--pretty-json` and `--json-indent` for all CLI options
**Labels**: `feature`, `good first issue`, `difficulty: easy`

In  #11583 we made `--pretty-print` affect Standard JSON and also added the `--json-indent` option. There are still some command-line options that ignore these:
- `--asm-json`
- `--ast-compact-json`
- `--abi`
- `--userdoc`
- `--devdoc`
- `--storage-layout`
- `--metadata`

Some of them always pretty-print the JSON but with hard-coded indent size, some do not pretty-print at all. Change them all so that by default the JSON output is compact and changes when `--pretty-print`/`json-indent` is used.

We might want to exempt `--metadata` from this since we embed its hash in the bytecode and a pretty-printed version would not match it. But maybe that's ok - it's meant to be reproducible and being able to easily inspect it is also important. And in any case `--combined-json metadata` does get affected by `--pretty-print` so we already have this problem.

After changing it, we'll need to add pretty printing options to command-line tests to keep them readable. Alternatively, we could implement #7665 first.

## Backwards Compatibility
I don't think that we guarantee stable JSON formatting between versions so I'd say this is not breaking.

Changing the formatting for `--metadata` might affect tools that hash its output but also use `--pretty-json` to get nice output from `--combined-json` at the same time. I think it's a pretty obscure case though.

Creater PR for this issue, skipped metadata as it prints json in a bit different way
