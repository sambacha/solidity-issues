Originally requested in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11688#discussion_r714703117.

## Abstract
Normally, importing files from arbitrary directories requires whitelisting those directories using `--allow-paths`. That's not the case when the import contains a remapping. This automatic whitelisting should be removed.

### Example
This causes an error:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/{dir,anotherdir}
touch /tmp/anotherdir/contract.sol
cd /tmp/dir/
echo "import '/tmp/anotherdir/contract.sol';" | solc -
```
```
Error: Source "/tmp/anotherdir/contract.sol" not found: File outside of allowed directories.
 --> <stdin>:1:1:
  |
1 | import '/tmp/anotherdir/contract.sol';
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

While this does not:
```bash
echo "import '/tmp/dir/contract.sol';" | solc - /tmp/dir/=/tmp/anotherdir/
```

This is especially weird when the remapping does not really do anything:
```bash
echo "import '/tmp/anotherdir/contract.sol';" | solc - /tmp/anotherdir/=/tmp/anotherdir/
```

## Specification
Remapping prefixes, targets and contexts should not be added to allowed paths.

## Backwards Compatibility
The change is not backwards-compatible. Users relying on this behavior will have to start adding `--allowed-paths` to their commands.

I like to try this issue, if it's not urgent

I think we also need a new test case; I don't know you add tests for this kind of issues or not. a downside comes to my mind is that adding tests for such small issues could make running our tests so time consuming after couple of years.
EDIT: we have lots of tests in `CommandLineParser.cpp` which tests this feature implicitly.

It's not urgent but this is not the best moment to start working on this because #11688 and #12007 have not been merged yet and they change a lot regarding `--allow-paths`. In particular #11688 adds a complete suite of tests so testing this should no longer be a problem.

It's also a breaking change so it should be based on `breaking` rather than `develop` branch and will only be released in 0.9.0, some time in the future.

Sure. Move to "review in progress" now. It will get moved to "done" automatically when the issue is closed.

Merging needs to wait for #12150 unfortunately.
