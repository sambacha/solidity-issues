The fix is more involved than I thought.

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L1624

Needs to change `ArrayType const*` to `ReferenceType const*`. However, since function types are not a reference type and since `StructType::isValidForLocation` only checks members which are reference type, that fix wouldn't work. 

https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/ast/Types.cpp#L2347

Somehow, internal function types should almost be treated like a reference type.

Duplicate of #11610.
