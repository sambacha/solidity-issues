Looking at the list of Yul transformations in the documentation, I noticed a few slight differences between the list at https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html#optimization-step-sequence and the list at https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/optimizer.html#optimizer-steps:

- [ ] In the second list, change FunctionalInliner to ExpressionInliner, just like in the first list.
- [ ] In the second list, change FullFunctionInliner to FullInliner, just like in the first list.
- [ ] Add UnusedFunctionParamterPruner to the first list.
