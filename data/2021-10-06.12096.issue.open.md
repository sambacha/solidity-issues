# [\#12096 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12096) `open`: Library interfaces as a means for high level delegatecalls
**Labels**: `language design :rage4:`

**Problem**: Solidity currently does not offer a way to do a high level delegatecall.

For example, to mimic a high level delegatecall to the following interface:

```solidity
interface I {
    function f(uint) external (uint);
}
```

one has to do the following:

```solidity
I impl = I(0x...);
require(address(impl).code.length > 0);
(bool sucess, bytes memory ret) = address(impl).delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSelector(I.f.selector, (...));
require(success);
uint ret_value = abi.decode(ret, (uint256));
```

----

**Proposal**: Library interfaces.

```solidity
library interface I {
    function g(uint) external returns(uint);
}
```

Now, the following is a high level `delegatecall`, that behaves exactly like the above code:
```solidity
uint ret_value = I(0x...).g(...);
```

Effectively the main difference between interfaces and library interfaces are that the former does a `call` or `staticcall`, whereas the latter does a `delegatecall`.

---

Inheritance: should we allow libraries to inherit from library interfaces? 

```solidity
library interface I {
    function f() external;
}

library L is I {
    function f() external {
        // the actual implementation
    }
}
```

---

They can be used as types and variables similar to how interfaces are used. This should cover applications mentioned in https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11695 (except for `new`).

For example:

```solidity
library interface I {
    function f() external;
}

library interface J {
   function g() external;
}

contract C {
    I immutable impl1;
    J impl2
    // Dynamic linking
    constructor(I _impl1, J _impl2) {
        impl1 = _impl1;
        impl2 = impl2;
    }

    // Now impl1.f() and impl2.g() are high level delegate calls.

    // some upgradability features
    function update_impl2(J _impl2) {
         impl2 = _impl2;
    }
}
```

I don't see why a library should not be able to automatically be a library interface.

I think libraries should be able to inherit from (multiple) library interfaces so that you can ensure that the interface conforms to the interface.

Another feature that people would maybe want to use (not sure we should add it) is to forward calls to unknown functions:
```
fallback() {
  impl1.__delegatecall(msg.data);
}
```
But maybe we can resort to low-level calls in this case.

I think the two paradigms in this code `L.f()` and `l.f()` does not belong together. If we allow `l.f()`, then `L.f()` should be disallowed. I'm somewhat in favour of keeping `L.f()` because static linking is more efficient than using immutable.

```solidity
library L {
   function f() external {
       // ...
   }
}

contract C {
    L l = L(0x...);
    function example() external {
        L.f();
        l.f();
    }
}
```

Decided to talk with users of libraries and collect a bunch of questions to ask them.
