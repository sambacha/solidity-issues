Since london, it could be cheaper again to use the identity precompile than mload / mstore in a loop to copy memory.

I think only Berlin's EIP-2929 affects it, and nothing in London does.

However if the saving is not significant, then to avoid the potential for future repricing adversely affecting it, I would not enable it.

Some relevant discussion from the chat:

@hrkrshnn 
> A random idea: about this: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12127. I think we should do it, a rough calculation is that a precompile staticcall should cost  about the same in case of  copying 2 words and get cheaper for more than 2 words.

> [RedundantStoreEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11352) can already deal with memory read and written by `staticcall()` just as if it was a pair of `mload()`/`mstore()` and it does not really care about the content being read/written.
> [EqualStoreEliminator](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12272) on the other hand only deals with simple single-slot store operations.

> Oh, one thing it might help with is that currently for `staticcall` we have to assume that arbitrary storage reads are possible during the call. So using it for memory copy in between two overlapping stores would prevent `RedundantStoreEliminator` from removing the redundant one.
I guess that with the builtin we could just assume that the precompile does not read or write any storage?

@hrkrshnn 
> Yeah, there are two things here. Loops are hard to work with. So if we can replace a for loop doing `mstore` by `memcopy`, analysis becomes easier. The other thing as you said is if you replace the loop by `staticcal(gas(), 4, ...)`, we'll need to start modelling `staticall` opcode's side-effects based on the address it calls.

I'm in favour of having a built in yul, especially if it can be also used in inline assembly. Though we may want to consider making this more generic.
