# [\#12137 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12137) `open`: Change the dispatch routine to help the optimizer
**Labels**: `enhancement`, `optimizer`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9073706?v=4" width="50">[chriseth](https://github.com/chriseth) opened issue at [2021-10-14 10:34](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12137):

The ir generator creates the external call dispatch routine and it contains cases that all end with `return(...)`. The fact that we return at that point cannot really be used by the optimizer for the inner functions unless all the inner functions are inlined into the main dispatch routine.

We should try if outlining the cases into individual functions might provide a better result.
