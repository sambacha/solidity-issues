# [\#12169 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12169) `open`: [Yul Optimizer] Do not move loop invariants that consume a lot of gas
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

This is a weird one.

```
contract C0 {
  function f0() external returns (bytes memory o1)
  {
    assembly
    {
      for { let i := 0 } lt(i, 1) { i := add(i, 1) }
      {
        if o1 { break }
        o1 := keccak256(0, 12345678912)
      }
    }
  }
}
// ====
// compileViaYul: also
// ----
// f0() -> 0x20, 0
```

fails via Yul.

To repro

```
$ cp test.sol test/libsolidity/semanticTests
$ isoltest -t semanticTests/test --optimize --show-messages
```

Asm diff that I tried to make sense of but gave me :-(

Another example

```
contract C0 {
  function f1() external returns (bytes memory o0)
  {
  assembly
    {
      {
          for { o0 := selfbalance() } o0
              {
                o0 := keccak256(0, 1155939646350332)
              } {}
      }
    }
  }
}
// ====
// compileViaYul: also
// ----
// f1() -> 0x20, 0
```

fails similarly via optimized IR.

This seems to be due to loop-invariant code motion. cc @hrkrshnn
Maybe we should not pull out things that are potentially very expensive?
On the other hand, the assumption was that if a loop is present in the code, we expect it to be executed at least once.

Yeah, the issue is with loop invariant code motion. The `keccak` is taken out of the loop, where it fails out of gas.

To be fair, there is no way to fix this without preventing `mload`, `keccak` from getting taken out of the loop. Especially if the offsets are not static. It's somewhat implicit that the optimizer assumes infinite gas, but this is a grey area, since EVM implementations seems to explicitly use `2**32` as max memory size and revert in all other cases. So not sure how we want to proceed here.

Just to be precise, the assumption would be `if loop present, all paths inside the loop body are executed at least once`?

The new codegen does assume a Max memory size, right?

See: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11714

The optimizer doesn't assume this.

I'm fine with closing this as won't fix since I can't think of a strong enough threat model.

I was thinking along the lines of

"Malicious smart contract steals ether (gas) by placing keccak inside a for loop that would only be evaluated if the Yul optimizer is enabled."

But I'm afraid that's not a strong enough threat model.
