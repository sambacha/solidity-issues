# [\#12211 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12211) `open`: Why is struct_copy.sol so badly optimized?
**Labels**: `optimizer`

Most of the `mstore` calls in https://gist.github.com/chriseth/05075e7706c8ea3f1ac628a28be486f7 are redundant and also the `keccak` call should only be evaluated once. Why does it perform so badly?

The example here is
```
    mstore(_1, var_k)
    mstore(0x20, _1)
    sstore(keccak256(_1, 0x40), 0x01)
    mstore(_1, var_k)
    mstore(0x20, _1)
```

The optimizer performs so badly because the redundant store eliminator ( #11352 ) only removes stores if they are not read from. What is needed here is removing stores that store the same data that is already present at that location.

The `mstores` are removed by https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12272 so this is nice, but we still need to replace the keccak calls to a stored local variable, i.e.
```
let x := keccak256(a, b)
let y := mload(c)
let y := keccak256(a, b)
```
should be optimized to
```
let x := keccak256(a, b)
let y := mload(c)
let y := x
```
