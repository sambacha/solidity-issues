While updating dependencies in https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/100#issue-774215950 I noticed that [js-ipld](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld), which we depend on seems to have been deprecated and replaced by [js-multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/js-multiformats).

The task is simply to change the dependency and figure out what object to pass to `ipfsImporter()` instead of `IPLD` in [`ipfsHash()`](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/blob/876858b2df0ea6f10b62e06485401db75176867c/update#L18-L22).

hi @cameel, I would like to work on it, can you tell me which branch to fork from to make changes?

The default branch of [solc-bin repo](https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/). It's called `gh-pages` rather than `master` due to historical reasons (it was used to serve Github Pages). Just make sure to start from the latest commit - https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/100 has been merged today.

Not sure if @hack3r-0m is still interested in this, but if not I'll give it a shot.

@elijahhampton Sure. Go ahead. Nothing has been done here so far so I think it's safe to reassign it at this point.

I just saw your comment.  Sure thing!

@cameel https://github.com/ethereum/solc-bin/pull/108

I would be happy to take another look at this.  My first instinct was to re create the IPLD object swapping out the parts that multi formats could handle.
