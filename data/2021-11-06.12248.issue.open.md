# [\#12248 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12248) `open`: use _library_ integer constants as fixed-length array sizes

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30356252?v=4" width="50">[benediamond](https://github.com/benediamond) opened issue at [2021-11-06 14:22](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12248):

## Description

Integer constants can't be used as the sizes of fixed-length arrays, _even_ when they come from libraries.

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.9
- Target EVM version (as per compiler settings): london
- Framework/IDE (e.g. Truffle or Remix): remix, hardhat, etc.
- EVM execution environment / backend / blockchain client:
- Operating system: MacOS

## Steps to Reproduce
`A.sol`:
```solidity
library A {
    uint256 constant N = 42;
}
```
`B.sol`:
```solidity
import './A.sol';

contract B {
    uint256[A.N] b;
}
```
leads to
```
TypeError: Invalid array length, expected integer literal or constant expression.
  --> contracts/B.sol:12:13:
   |
12 |         uint256[A.N] b;
   |                 ^^^

-->
```
somewhat related original issue, about constants in the _same_ file, now fixed: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/716
https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1290 is _not_ the same issue; it's about grabbing constants from other contracts which are _not_ libraries. but the workaround suggested there also works here.

I think fixed size array expect compile time constant , but here A.N will be evaluated at runtime .

A workaround for now would be to move the constant to file level.

This issue could have a duplicate somewhere by the way.

i looked carefully and didn't find one.

interesting, this move hadn't occurred to me. thanks. feel free to close if you want (though of course i think the "issue" is still open).
