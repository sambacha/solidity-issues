**Labels**: `enhancement`, `language server`

The motivation behind is, to be able to display additional information about a declaration, not just its type signature.

This might also help documentation.

The relevant AST nodes I'd at least expand to are:

* struct definition
* enum definition
* enum value defintion
* (others?)

If we want to do that, our LSP can then expose this information.

Would really like to see this. On top of the ones mentioned in the issue, I'd add custom errors and user defined value types.

It's currently weird because it's possible to add NatSpec in the source code but it doesn't show up in the AST.

Sounds good!
