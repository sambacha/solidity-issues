## Page

[Introduction to Smart Contracts](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html)
Subsection: Blocks -> Note (just before The Ethereum Virtual Machine section)

## Abstract

The [Alarm Clock](https://www.ethereum-alarm-clock.com/) website does not appear to be up-to-date and has a message saying "Ethereum Alarm Clock **was** a service that allowed scheduling transactions to be executed at a later time on the ethereum blockchain." The project [repo](https://github.com/ethereum-alarm-clock/ethereum-alarm-clock) also doesn't appear to be maintained - last PR was closed in 2020 and there's no activity on recent open issues and PRs. 

## Pull request

<!--
Please link to your pull request which resolves this issue

Wanted to present suggestions before making PR:
- Option 1: Delete reference to alarm clock if the project is no longer being maintained
- Option 2: Suggest newer decentralized smart contract scheduling tools (like [Gelato](https://docs.gelato.network/introduction/master) for example)

Thanks for reporting! I think that it would be best to remove the reference and reword the paragraph to just state in a general way that one could use a service of that type. Replacing it with a different project might be convenient for users, but I think that nowadays there are multiple services like that and the docs should be impartial here. This actually applies to the Alarm Clock but I suspect that in the early days when it was added the situation was different.

Would you like to submit a PR with a correction?

Yes I'd be happy to make a PR with a correction. Thank you for your help!
