# [\#12483 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12483) `open`: Disallow virtual modifiers
**Labels**: `breaking change :warning:`, `feature`, `language design :rage4:`

Modifiers are already a very complicated concept and we should not make it more difficult by allowing them to be virtual. Except for weird cases (adding another placeholder, putting it inside a loop, ...), you can get the same behaviour by adding a virtual function that is called from the modifier.

I would propose to remove this feature from the language with 0.9.0.
