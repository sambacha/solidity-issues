# [\#12535 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12535) `closed`: [Logging] Indexed log topic differs between legacy and IR if explicitly downcast
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`, `codegen error`

```
contract C {
  event ev0(bytes1 indexed);
  constructor() {
    emit ev0(bytes1(bytes16(0x31313131313131313131313131313131)));
  }
}
// ====
// compileViaYul: also
// ----
// constructor() ->
// ~ emit ev0(bytes1): #"1"
```

Legacy truncates indexed log topic, while IR leaves it untruncated. This would lead to a divergence of blockchain state depending on which backend is used.

To reproduce

```
$ cp test.sol test/libsolidity/semanticTests
$ isoltest -t semanticTests/test
  Running via Yul:
  Expected result:
  // constructor() ->
  // ~ emit ev0(bytes1): #"1"

  Obtained result:
  // constructor() ->
  // ~ emit ev0(bytes1): #"1111111111111111"
  
  Attention: Updates on the test will apply the detected format displayed.
  
  Note that the test passed without Yul. 
```

Note that the divergence is maintained with/without optimizer so I would guess this may be a bug related to truncation (or lack thereof) in Sol->Yul.

The one that matches the spec :) Value-type parameters are not hashed and the value passed to the event is just one byte (`0x31`, i.e. `"1"` in ASCII) so that's what should be stored.

IR behavior is weird here though. The value is not a hash but the original `bytes16` value so somehow it does not generate code for the `bytes1` conversion. Or maybe the lower bytes just aren't cleaned? Alternatively, could be a bug with how isoltest displays it. We added support for events only quite recently (#11050).

By the way, I think we should update the docs for indexed parameters as a part of this issue. [Encoding of Indexed Event Parameters](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#encoding-of-indexed-event-parameters) actually does not say anything about the encoding indexed parameters of value types. It only mentions non-values types.

In [Contracts > Events](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#events) it's also not stated outright, only implied:
> You can add the attribute `indexed` to up to three parameters which adds them to a special data structure known as [“topics”](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html#abi-events) instead of the data part of the log. A topic can only hold a single word (32 bytes) so if you use a [reference type](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#reference-types) for an indexed argument, the Keccak-256 hash of the value is stored as a topic instead.
