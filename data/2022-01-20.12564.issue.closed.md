# [\#12564 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12564) `closed`: [Sol->Yul] ICE when copying array of function ptr type from storage to memory
**Labels**: `bug :bug:`

```
contract C {

  constructor(function() external[1][] memory i0)
  {
    i0[0] = s0[1];
  }
}
```

throws

Repro

```
$ solc --ir test.sol
```

Note that memory to storage copy of the same type does not throw via IR.

Also falls under https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12558

But due to the base type being a multi-slot type, it's actually an interesting special case, which we should watch out for when fixing #12558, so probably good to keep it open and check specifically.

Closing as duplicate of #12558

Ok, I just commented there to watch out for multi-slot base types then :-).
