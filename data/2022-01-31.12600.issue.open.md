```

The isoltest call to `f()` via IR does not return `3` (instead returns `uint256` 0x00...0403 i.e., `4` placed at index 1 as if the tuple assignment in the constructor was not cleaned up).

Legacy call to `f()` returns `3`.

This may be a false positive in the following sense

```
Note that access via inline assembly is not considered such an operation: If you use inline assembly to access Solidity variables shorter than 256 bits, the compiler does not guarantee that the value is properly cleaned up.
```

as documented here: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/variable_cleanup.html

Nonetheless, it would be good if this could be confirmed by another pair of eyes :-)

I don't think this is about cleanup - it is about the order of evaluation of the assignment to the storage variable.
For Yul, we kind of promise strict left-to-right evaluation, so 
```
(s0, s0[1], s0) = ([3], 4, [5]);
```
should be equivalent to
```
s0 = [3];
s0[1] = 4;
s0 = [5];
```
but it seems this is not the case.

I'm also wondering if `s0 = [5]` sets the size to 1.

If it is an order-of-evaluation issue, I don't understand why a call to `f()` via legacy would return `3` (it should also have evaluated the second tuple expression in any case).

Can you modify it to also return the length? I think in legacy, it just evaluates from right to left and thus the last assignment is `s0 = [3]`.

The function `g()` in the original post returns the contents of the array by copying it to memory. There both legacy and IR return the same length (`1`) and content (`3`).
