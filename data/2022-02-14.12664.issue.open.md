# [\#12664 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12664) `open`: Investigate asan/ubsan memory leak reports in Z3/spacer or selectively disable reports.
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`


#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1347491?v=4" width="50">[ekpyron](https://github.com/ekpyron) opened issue at [2022-02-14 13:02](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12664):

In https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12662 I disabled running smt tests in ubsan nightly test runs. They were already disabled in asan runs.

The reason is that we get memory leaks in Z3/spacer.

We should still investigate these leaks eventually, respectively instead of adding ``--no-smt`` to the test runs, selectively disable reports from spacer-allocated memory.

I'm also not sure if linking against the gcc-compiled static z3 library in these clang-based test runs is sane, so we can also see what happens if we use a clang-based static z3 build instead.
