## Page

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/style-guide.html

## Abstract

There is nothing that references the immutable variable style guides. 

Should it follow the syntax of `CONSTANTS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` or `camelCase`?

This is prioritized as "new opinions" which is below "broken things".
