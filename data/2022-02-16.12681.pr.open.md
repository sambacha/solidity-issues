A maximum line length of 79 characters is antiquated.  Github allows 140 character widths and etherscan shows 233 characters when displaying verified contracts.  

We should suggest a maximum of 120 and we can still reference the PEP8's maximum allowed 99 characters.

This is a good suggestion. But I recommend that we please table this discussion until all less controversial work is completed.

Please mark PR as "DRAFT" in GitHub.
