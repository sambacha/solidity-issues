**Labels**: `optimizer`

Nothing fancy, but a few gas here and there...

Is there an optimizer step that might be more fitting? Structural sounds more like it operates on the structure of the code...

I didn't see anything obvious... the expression simplifier only acts on expressions and can't easily add the ``pop``... and the structural simplifier already has the literal rematerializer as soft-requirement, s.t. we likely get the ``0`` as literal...
We could extend the expression simplifier to expression statements instead I guess...

Or start a new one?

Actually the ``ExpressionSimplifier`` is suitable after all - we already restrict simplification to variables to avoid side-effect issues anyways, so we can also just do that for this (and then don't need to insert a ``pop`` at all).
