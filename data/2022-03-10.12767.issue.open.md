Closes #11889.

**## Abstract**

Private functions are isolated to the specific contract they are defined in. This holds true during inheritance as well. A contract that inherits another contract cannot use or access private functions from the parent contract. In cases where a contract inherits two separate contracts that each contain the same private function name, there should be no compilation error due to naming conflicts. 

**## Motivation**

Because inheriting contracts cannot use or access the private functions of parent contracts, enforcing uniqueness of these private function names is unnecessarily restrictive.

An example of how this can happen is explained [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11889#issue-987605750)


**## Specification**

1. Update the [ambiguous overrides checking function](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c47da51eab8e5c4ebff0f6dd2ca748179aa21ab4/libsolidity/analysis/OverrideChecker.cpp#L727) in [OverrideChecker](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c47da51eab8e5c4ebff0f6dd2ca748179aa21ab4/libsolidity/analysis/OverrideChecker.cpp#L1) to track the scope of functions when comparing them for uniqueness.

2.  Write tests for that case [here](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/69411436139acf5dbcfc5828446f18b9fcfee32c/test/libsolidity/syntaxTests/inheritance)  


**## Backwards Compatibility**

This change makes solidity compilation strictly more permissive and should not introduce any incompatibilities with existing contracts.

Duplicate of https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11889 (I guess that was intentional and this is a follow-up on https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11889#issuecomment-1034857704 - but why create a new issue?).

Also I don't think the specification in the description here is how this should be done. Rather, ``ContractDefinition::definedFunctions`` should be split into functions visible only in the contract itself and functions also visible via inheritance and the override checker should in general only use the appropriate version. The tricky part will be to verify that all uses of (the versions of) this function will remain correct throughout the compiler and that it's never possible to call an incorrect function due to this.

hey @ekpyron thanks for your comment, the new issue was created merely with the purpose of funding it through the Gitcoin Grants. My understanding is that the issue has to be created by the account attached to the Gitcoin profile, I am going to check this with the Gitcoin team. 

Regarding the rest of your comment, if you are able to provide a specification in greater details I am more than happy to support it

I added `Closes #11889` to the description so that resolving this should also close the other issue (I think it works like with PRs).

I would like to get involved with Ethereum related development, and this task seems easy enough for someone even with zero experience in the specific area, but very many experience in coding. So I would give a shot, if you are patient enough. It seems this is not an urgent task, the given one year timeframe must be enough :)

Steps:
- Setup build environment and do builds.
- Study the code around the specific task and in general also.
- Learn and run test.
- Create a test which fails with current code, but should be OK with the enhancement.
- Fix code to satisfy requirement.
- Submit solution.

I am leaning towards this not being something to change.

Solidity allows for parent contracts to be called from within contracts that have inherited them using the "Super" function. 

Wouldn't it then be possible for contract AB to gain access to contract A's functions by calling the Super function, at which point contract AB could call MyPrivateFunction and cause contract A to call the same function as there is no way to differentiate between the two functions?

Another issue is that it is possible to override functions as long as they are not "Private"
All interface contracts treat functions as virtual, which are able to be overridden. that might create an issue since contract A can be treated as an interface contract if it was to inherit an interface like many contracts do (for example erc20 is Ierc20 is pretty common) and calls it internally rather than through an externally accessed library contract. 

and all of this is may not be dangerous or even possible when using high level code like Solidity, but what happens when you interact with contract AB's virtual Interface? (lets call it the ABI for now) sorry for the pun! 

it just seems like having a private inaccessible function  indistinguishable from a function that a contract can access would eventually create a backdoor for another contract down the road, Especially if either contract has admin proxy upgrade functions, not to mention the possibility that the contract that was inherited might be the malicious contract! 

Although you may not have to worry about your contract being exploited, others may use your contract with ambiguous overrides to unambiguously override the private functions of contracts that unknowingly use your contracts code through inheritance....  the same way Contract A might access your contract and possibly override or gain access to MyPrivateFunction from within contract (AB)'s virtual interface.

What's up with this? :P I've seen estimates like that in our other gitcoin grant too. Is this set by the applicant or is this something like date not being set at all and just displayed weirdly?

@cameel the first applicant mentioned one year as an estimate time to deliver the task, I gave preference to the second one who seemed to be more committed to deliver fast 
Let's see ...

Just to make sure: it's clear that this has to be done following https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12767#issuecomment-1063901600 rather than the specification in the current issue description, right?

@fsw-life please get in contact with us. Issues like these could be rather delicate and I think it is vital to discuss how to solve this issue at least on a high level. You can either comment here or (preferred) join our matrix chat or team meetings as explained on our [contributing](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html) page.
