## Abstract
`solc --link` is the only input mode that modifies input files in place. In all the other modes the compiler prints to stdout by default and only writes to files when the `--output-dir` option is used. I think that the `--link` option should be changed to behave like the other input modes.

## Motivation
The way it works currently, apart from just being inconsistent, is one of the reasons why do not have any tests covering it - our command-line test framework is not suited for testing the output written to a file. Especially when the output overwrites the input file.

## Specification
- By default `--link` should print to stdout.
- When `--output-dir` is used, the output should go to a file in the output directory. The name of the file should match the input file. The expected file extension is `.bin` but we don't enforce or change that, even if the input file has a different extension.
- Add some command-line tests covering this input mode
- Add a test for this input mode in [`test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp), similarly to how other modes are covered. The test should simply use as many command-line flags as possible and make sure the resulting `CommandLineOptions` object looks like it should.

## Backwards Compatibility
The change is not backwards compatible.

Before we change this, we should ask if people use it like that. I think it could be rather annoying to change the behaviour if you use it like that.

Well, currently you have no other choice. It's the only way to use it (we don't support this via Standard JSON). So it's more of a question of whether people use it at all.

Even if they do use it, I think that for manual use this will actually be more intuitive (I was a bit surprised by this when I tried to use it for the first time) and for scripted usage we should just add this to Standard JSON.

I am happy to work on this issue.

@MohamedAlaa201 We still need to decide if we want to do this. This is way it's labeled `good first issue candidate` and not `good first issue`.
