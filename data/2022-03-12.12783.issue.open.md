# [\#12783 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12783) `open`: UnimplementedFeatureError with no line indication

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7003246?v=4" width="50">[barakman](https://github.com/barakman) opened issue at [2022-03-12 07:52](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12783):

## Description

I am getting an error with no indication of which line it refers to:
```
UnimplementedFeatureError: Copying of type struct MyStruct memory[] memory to storage not yet supported.
```

## Environment

- Compiler version: 0.8.12

## Steps to Reproduce

Well, I need to dig through my code in order to find it, but on the compiler side, the problem is probably in ArrayUtils.cpp:
```
solUnimplemented("Copying of type " + _sourceType.toString(false) + " to storage not yet supported.");
```

Thanks :)
