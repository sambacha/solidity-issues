Hi @chriseth 
Apologies for taking so long to coming around to this. I've made some of the edits you mentioned but I see some tests failing , e.g.,:

`/solidity/test/boostTest.cpp:120: error: in "syntaxTests/pragma/broken_version_5": Exception during extracted test: /solidity/libsolidity/parsing/Parser.cpp(166): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::Parser::parsePragmaVersion(const solidity::langutil::SourceLocation &, const vector<solidity::langutil::Token> &, const vector<std::string> &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::SemVerError>
std::exception::what: Invalid versionPart: _
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Invalid versionPart: _`

`/solidity/test/boostTest.cpp:120: error: in "syntaxTests/pragma/broken_version_4": Exception during extracted test: /solidity/libsolidity/parsing/Parser.cpp(166): Throw in function void solidity::frontend::Parser::parsePragmaVersion(const solidity::langutil::SourceLocation &, const vector<solidity::langutil::Token> &, const vector<std::string> &)
Dynamic exception type: boost::wrapexcept<solidity::langutil::SemVerError>
std::exception::what: Invalid versionPart: (
[solidity::util::tag_comment*] = Invalid versionPart: (`

Whilst I debug them I was hoping you might be able to take a look and see whether this is more inline with what you were thinking following your comments.

I had to decline the old PR as trying to sync with the branch I accidentally pulled a load of unwanted commits.

Thanks

This looks very good already!

Needs review again

Hey @chriseth - just a friendly chase on this PR - the only outstanding thing I believe is now the failing test `broken_version_7.sol` mentioned previously and a subsequent re-review. Any suggestions on how to progress so we can get this merged?

@nishant-sachdeva Maybe you could help @vinayman with the test here?
