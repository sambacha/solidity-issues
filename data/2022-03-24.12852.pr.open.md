Just re-using the same text from an almost exact same example in another part of the docs, so that there is no confusion between them -- and because the statement that assignments to "storage objects can only be made from existing storage objects" enhances the semantic reason the expression is not valid, with the syntactic limit enforced by the compiler because of it.

By the way, in a few places in the doc there is discussion of "local reference variables" but I'm not sure this terminology is defined anywhere. I'll make a PR once I'm fully confident in the definition, but it appears these words refer to non-value type (i.e., complex types like arrays) variables of storage class that are not defined at the contract scope??
