# [\#12922 Issue](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12922) `open`: Increase test coverage for Calldata Validation
**Labels**: `testing :hammer:`

We have comparably decent test coverage and fuzzing confirmation for data integrity on decoding valid calldata encodings.
However, we have only sparse coverage for calldata validation, leading to bugs like https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/12907 going unnoticed.

While it is hard to test *everything* (this would mean checking all combinations between static and dynamic types up to three dimensions and in each verify the bounds checks for re-encoding, index accessing, copying to memory and copying to storage, resulting in an enormous test space), and we should also try to employ fuzzing for the validation part (see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12914), at least *some* more coverage in the unit tests would be good as well.

Hey @ekpyron - I'd be keen to contribute to this issue, ideally with fuzzing but I'd be productive on adding unit tests too, if you're accepting outside work :) 

Is there a Discord channel or something similar where I can go over the details of this task a little more, and to find some examples of existing fuzzing tests to use as a starting point?

Sorry, for a late response. Most of the team has been out for Devconnect and we're still not all back even now.

We have a Matrix channel, where you can talk to us directly about anything compiler-related: [#solidity-dev](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ethereum_solidity-dev:gitter.im). Also, the person to talk about fuzzing specifically would be @bshastry. He's managing our (pretty extensive) fuzzing setup. If you can work with him to fuzz this particular part of the compiler, it would actually be pretty great!

Thanks @cameel! I've joined the channel and DM'd @bshastry.
