Btw, where does the "constant variable evaluation & substitution" step happen? I wonder if this would affect it, since we are allowing member access in rhs of constant variables now.

Looking deeper, we were handling this correctly for file-level constant because of [this line](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/TypeChecker.cpp#L3506). Member access is similar to identifier, so this should give more confidence to this PR.

See [`ConstantEvaluator.h`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/libsolidity/analysis/ConstantEvaluator.h) and the places where it's used.

Hmm I did check all the usages but none of them is doing what I was looking for.

Then I dumped the IR and things make sense now. At least at the IR level, it seems that each constant (or all?) variable is turned into a function, and the initialization expression is linearized into IR statements in the function body. I assume constant propagation will clean things up further?

Regardless, this PR shouldn't affect things there.

Please also add some tests where the constants are used as array lengths of statically-sized arrays, both as forward and as backward references.

I think this is more involved than expected. The logic chain is as follows:

- To use a constant variable as array lengths, `DeclarationTypeChecker::endVisit(ArrayTypeName)` requires the variable to either (1) already be a rational number, e.g., `X = 42`, or (2) can be evaluated to a rational number by `ConstantEvaluator`.
- To use `X = L.INT` as array length, we must go with (2).
- `ConstantEvaluator` currently doesn't evaluate `MemberAccess`. But to support it, we must check for circular dependencies in constant declarations first, which is currently done in `PostTypeChecker`.

I think this reveals a larger issue than this PR is concerned -- We probably want to augment `ConstantEvaluator` to evaluate more things like member access, but that eventually entails moving constant circular dependence check to earlier places in the compilation stack.

Currently the compilation stack is a bit awkward for constant evaluation, i.e.,

```
...
DeclarationTypeChecker (use of constant variable as array size is checked)
...
TypeChecker (purity information is propagated, e.g., this PR)
...
PostTypeChecker (constant circular dependence is checked)
...
```

I think the logics in parenthesis should be reversed...?

Sorry, I should have clarified: Please add tests so that we see that it does not catastrophically fail. I did not mean to implement this feature for the constant evaluator.

And you are right, the constant evaluator is not at the right place, we have a larger issue planned to extend it.
