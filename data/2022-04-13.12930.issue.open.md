## Abstract

The ability to cast `bool`s to `uint256` or `uint8`.

## Motivation

Branchless optimizations are becoming more and more common to see lately, but often they require dropping down into inline assembly since their efficiency depends on being able to treat a bool as a uint that resolves to either `1` in the true case or `0` if false. Solidity should support performing these conversions without jumps or branches as bools are already represented this way under the hood. Requiring devs to drop into assembly is presenting them with a bunch of extra footguns to hurt themselves with, adding this ability to the high level language will make Solidity safer for devs and make these optimization techniques more readable.

## Specification

I am not opinionated as to whether bools would have to be cast to `uint8`s or `uint256`s assuming they use the same amount of gas. I will demonstrate both possible options:

```solidity
bool status = false;
assert(uint256(status) == 0);
```

```solidity
bool status = true;
assert(uint8(status) == uint8(1));
```

## Backwards Compatibility

I don't think this would introduce any backwards compatibility issues, but please correct me if so!

Rather than allowing this cast, we'd prefer working towards improving code generation and the optimizer to have ``status ? 1 : 0`` result in branchless code to begin with, i.e. have the solidity optimizer perform the branchless optimization you want on its own. That would help much more generally.

Do you happen to have some examples at hand where such a cast is performed in inline assembly?

[This function](https://github.com/recmo/solmate/blob/2b0cf0c043a1933fb9018a95c8513bd7a5ac7d08/src/utils/BitwiseLib.sol#L13) is a nice example, the assembly block exists only because we want to go from `lt(-,-)` to `0` or `1` efficiently:

```solidity
    function ilog2(uint256 x) internal returns (uint256 r) {
        assembly {
            r := shl(7, lt(0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff, x))
            r := or(r, shl(6, lt(0xffffffffffffffff, shr(r, x))))
            r := or(r, shl(5, lt(0xffffffff, shr(r, x))))
            r := or(r, shl(4, lt(0xffff, shr(r, x))))
            r := or(r, shl(3, lt(0xff, shr(r, x))))
            r := or(r, shl(2, lt(0xf, shr(r, x))))
            r := or(r, shl(1, lt(0x3, shr(r, x))))
            r := or(r, lt(0x1, shr(r, x)))
        }
    }
```

It would be great if this could be rewritten at same or better gas cost as:

```solidity
       r  = ((0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff < x) ? 1 : 0) << 7;
       r |= ((0xffffffffffffffff < (x >> r)) ? 1 : 0) << 6;
       r |= ((0xffffffff < (x >> r)) ? 1 : 0) << 5;
       r |= ((0xffff < (x >> r)) ? 1 : 0) << 4;
       // ...
```

It would be *awesome* if it could be rewritten at same or better gas cost as:

```solidity
       r  = (0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff < x) ? 127 : 0;
       r |= (0xffffffffffffffff < (x >> r)) ? 64 : 0;
       r |= (0xffffffff < (x >> r)) ? 32 : 0;
       r |= (0xffff < (x >> r)) ? 8 : 0;
       // ...
```

But that requires a more complex optimization rule where the compiler realizes it can turn `? 2**n : 0` into `? 1 : 0` with a cheap bitshift.

Think about the last rule some more. If the optimization pass turns `x ? a : b` into `(x ? a: 1) * (a - b) + b` and existing optimization passes elliminate `+ 0` and reduce `* 2**n` into `<< n` than this would be taken care of!
