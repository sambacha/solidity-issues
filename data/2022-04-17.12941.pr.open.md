This addresses [#12856](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/12856).

~I've made a small change to ObjectParser as part of this to set the `.subId` fields as they didn't seem to be set anywhere.~

This is my first contribution to this project so be aware of that when reviewing the changes.

This looks good in general, but I think we are getting some complications due to the feature that we can select a single sub-object to run on. Is this actually needed? Also I didn't take a look at the output yet, but could you check that if the object is only a single object with only code, that it prints the code without the object?

Thanks for the review! I've addressed your comments and made sure that the output for a code block is still a code block. I can't comment on the utility of the `<object>` flag myself. The author of the issue might be able to. At this point the implementation for that feature is a pretty neat chunk of code that doesn't call anything weird.
