<!--## Prerequisites

- First, many thanks for taking part in the community. We really appreciate that.
- We realize there is a lot of data requested here. We ask only that you do your best to provide as much information as possible so we can better help you.
- Support questions are better asked in one of the following locations:
    - [Solidity chat](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/)
- Ensure the issue isn't already reported (check `feature` and `language design` labels).

## Abstract

<!--Please describe by example what problem you see in the current Solidity language and reason about it.-->

When a function doesn't exist in a contract, the contract simply reverts. It's quite frequent that devs jumble up contract addresses while interacting with the contracts (on the client-side), and they just see a `execution reverted` error which might not be helpful for someone in this situation for the first time.

## Motivation

<!--In this section you describe how you propose to address the problem you described earlier, including by giving one or more exemplary source code snippets for demonstration.-->

But if some data is included (like a 4 bytes selector), it'd help libraries like ethers to show a better error. (related discussion https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/discussions/2958). I understand this would not help with existing deployed contracts but in the long term this might be helpful.

## Specification

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow any developer to implement the functionality.-->

Solidity may revert with something like this, instead of no revert data.

```solidity
error FunctionNotFound();
```

## Backwards Compatibility

There should be no issues.

<!--
All language changes that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.

Please describe how you propose to deal with these incompatibilities.
-->
