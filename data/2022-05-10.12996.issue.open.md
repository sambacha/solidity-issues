## Abstract

Generally disallowing state-changing effects after an `external` function call and enabling the possibility to mark functions that specifically do this.

## Motivation

I started this discussion on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1523231260721975296) after another reentrancy attack (Cc: @chriseth). Reentrancy attacks are ubiquitous and even though there are toolings available (e.g. Slither) that conduct a static analysis it requires an initial setup as well as a proper understanding of how to interpret the results. In order to make the Solidity development more secure and sustainable I feel it's time to finally introduce such a language feature that disallows state-changing effects after an `external` function call and mark functions that specifically do this.

## Specification

All state-changing effects after an `external` function call are disallowed. If you want to allow however such a possibility, we introduce a new modifier `unprotected` whose default value is `false`.

## Backwards Compatibility

The code that previously compiled fine will not compile anymore if there is a state-change effect after an `external` call and the new modifier `unprotected` is unknown, so it's a breaking change.

Just a comment on the name of the modifier: I don't like opinionated words like "safe" or "protected" because they give a false impression of safety or protection, we should find a more neutral one.

Also more generally: Also wrt. free functions, it might be a good idea to explicitly pass/provide something like a "context" as a parameter to functions that allows external calls (or maybe even state changes without external calls). In this case, we could have a special property on this context that allows state changes after an external call. By default, the context would transform into a "constant state" context after an external call - there are the linear types again.

Also something to consider more specifically to this issue: Is it OK to do another external call after the first external call? What about a delegatecall? Even if we do not use delegatecall, how do we distinguish a "data contract" that is associated to the current contract from a potentially malicious external contract?

After all these questions, I'm more and more inclined that this should rather be "off-loaded" to user code and the compiler should instead provide the required features for the type system.

You are right about the name of the modifier - after thinking through it today maybe we even do not need a modifier but can use the `unchecked` block syntax directly. I think in a _broader sense_ this language feature is consistent with the checked arithmetic introduced in solc version `0.8.0` since it also wants to prevent unwanted behaviour that could be exploited (one of the major reasons behind introducing libraries such as `SafeMath` were smart contract exploits based on overflow/underflow vulnerabilities).

There are three types of reentrancy:
- Single Function Reentrancy
- Cross-Function Reentrancy
- Cross-Contract Reentrancy

For the cross-contract reentrancy, this one can happen when a state from one contract is used in another contract, but that state is not fully updated before getting called.

The conditions required for the cross-contract reentrancy to be possible are as follows:
- The execution flow can be controlled by the attacker to manipulate the contract state.
- The value of the state in the contract is shared or used in another contract.

The best outcome for this language feature would be that one could write the contracts without bothering about these three types by _default_. Of course, we can always argue to "offload" all the responsibility to the developers but past experience and events showcase blatantly that this does not work as intended.

Coming back to your context idea - I really like it but couldn't we simply achieve that via the `unchecked` block syntax. I.e. an `unchecked` block does not only _not_ control for an unrestricted integer that falls outside the range of the result type but also allows for a "non-constant state". By default, however, the context is a "constant state".

I'm not yet sure what would be the best design here tbh.

I would like to quickly add some further thoughts behind this language feature: The main question is whether we should build the language in a _via negativa_ or _via positiva_ way. I strongly tend based on the experience and events over the last 6 years to the first one. If you look at all the exploits that happened over the last 6 years (including DAO) we haven't got really smarter w.r.t. to reentrancy attacks as it seems (I also blame a little bit the auditors who push for the low-level calls instead e.g. transfer). Too many devs are still not paranoid enough! And Solidity already started implementing such safety features via `unchecked` for over/underflows. It's definitely a tradeoff here and my reasoning is practice-driven.
