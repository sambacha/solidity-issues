https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport uses `--via-ir`

The compile times are rather disappointing at ~10 minutes. Need to use it as a benchmark and tune performance of `solc`.

This is particularly about foundry. `forge build`.

This is not a problem on my side. With Hardhat it takes ~15 seconds with legacy pipeline and ~60 seconds with `--via-ir`.

@axic Was mainly about foundry. Updated the issue. Hardhat is fine on my end as well.

@hrkrshnn That sounds like something you'd get in a debug build. Is that on a M1 Mac or a Linux ARM system? If so, where is Foundry getting the binary from?
